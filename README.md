# Elite Network Map

This repository contains data generated by an AI-powered scraper that maps networks of influence, power, and funding in contemporary politics.

Each folder represents a 'run' of the scraper characterized by specific generations of the script, containing Markdown files formatted for Obsidian.md. These files describe entities (people, organizations) and their relationships, with a focus on hidden connections and strategic influence.
