is an American publicly traded company specializing in software platforms for data.[3] Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it was founded in 2003 by [[Peter Thiel]],[4] [[Stephen Cohen]],[5] [[Joe Lonsdale]],[6] [[Alex Karp]],[7] and Nathan Gettings.[8][9]
Palantir Gotham is an intelligence tool used by militaries and counter-terrorism analysts, including the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (USIC) and [[United States Department of Defense]].
Palantir has been criticized for its involvement in expanding government surveillance through [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies.[21][22] Some former employees and critics have raised concerns about its contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], which enable deportations and the aggregation of sensitive data on Americans.[23][24] Supporters argue that Palantir does not collect or store data itself but rather provides software that helps clients analyze data they already possess, while clients retain control and rights over their own information.
In 2004, Thiel bankrolled the creation of a prototype by PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings and Stanford University students Joe Lonsdale and [[Stephen Cohen]].
The same year, Thiel hired [[Alex Karp]], a former colleague of his from Stanford Law School, as chief executive officer.[31]
According to Gilman Louie, head of [[In-Q-Tel]] (a venture capital corporation associated with the CIA and the intelligence community[32][33]), after Thiel recruited Karp, the two founders came to him with some ideas but no clear problem to solve.
Palantir evolved from that software when Thiel proposed the company to Karp and Cohen.[35] According to Wired, in 2004, Thiel and Karp met [[John Poindexter]], a Department of Defense official who recognized their "interesting idea" and helped them gather "a legion of advocates from the most influential strata of government".
According to Karp, [[Sequoia Capital]] chairman [[Michael Moritz]] doodled through an entire meeting, and a [[Kleiner Perkins]] executive lectured the founders about the company's inevitable failure.[37][38]
In its early years its work included a subprime lender study for Center for Public Integrity and analyses of Somali piracy, Hezbollah, and the platform used to detect the Chinese GhostNet.[44] Palantir said computers alone using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] could not defeat an adaptive adversary.
Journalist Whitney Webb, who is noted for her investigative work on [[Jeffrey Epstein]],[46] has written that Palantir's origin was the Pentagon's "Total Awareness Program" and that Palantir is a CIA front.
She also links Palantir and Thiel to the CIA, [[Mossad]], and the Epstein network's alleged plan to create "an Orwellian nightmare".
She has published these theories on the Chinese version of [[MintPress News]], a far-left site known for being part of the "Russian web of disinformation",[47][48][49] and through Trineday, a publisher found by the conspiracy theorist[50] Kris Millegan.[51][52][53] The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs describes Webb as a MintPress journalist.[54]
In April 2010, Palantir announced a partnership with Thomson Reuters to sell the Palantir Metropolis product as "QA Studio" (a quantitative analysis tool).[55] On June 18, 2010, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and [[Office of Management and Budget]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] held a press conference at the White House announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus by the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] (RATB).
Biden credited the success to the software, Palantir, being deployed by the federal government.[56] He announced that the capability would be deployed at other government agencies, starting with [[Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].[57][58][59][60]
A document leaked to TechCrunch revealed that Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least 12 groups in the U.S. government, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], the [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], the [[West Point|United States Military Academy]], the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies, the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].
In September 2013, Palantir disclosed over $196 million in funding, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[63][64] It was estimated that the company would likely sign almost $1 billion in contracts in 2014.[65] CEO [[Alex Karp]] announced in 2013 that the company would not pursue an IPO, as going public would make "running a company like ours very difficult."[66] In December 2013, the company began a round of financing, raising around $450 million from private funders.
If completed, Forbes said Palantir's funding could reach $1.2 billion.[66] As of December 2014, the company continued to have diverse private funders, [[Ken Langone]] and [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], [[In-Q-Tel]] of the CIA,[67] [[Tiger Global Management]], and [[Founders Fund]], a venture firm operated by Thiel.[66]
Palantir was one of four large technology firms[75] to start working with the [[NHS]] on supporting COVID-19 efforts through the provision of software from Palantir Foundry,[76] and by April 2020, several countries had used Palantir's technology to track and contain the contagion.[77] Palantir also developed Tiberius, a software for vaccine allocation used in the United States.[78]
As of May 2025,[update] the second Trump administration had spent $113 million on existing and new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and [[The Pentagon]] plus a contract of $795 million with the DOD, while deliberating contracts for the [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].[24]
As of 2021, the company had invested over $400 million into nearly two dozen [[Special-purpose acquisition company|special-purpose acquisition company]] (SPAC) targets according to investment bank [[RBC Capital Markets]], while bringing alongside those companies as customers.[98]
It is an evolution of Palantir's longstanding work in the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and is used by intelligence and defense agencies.
[[NHS England]] also used Foundry in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze the operation of the vaccination program.
In June 2021, Foxglove, a tech-justice nonprofit, started a campaign against the company because "Their background has generally been in contracts where people are harmed, not healed." Supporting the campaign, [[Clive Lewis MP]] said Palantir had an "appalling track record".[101]
As of 2022,[update] Foundry was also used for the administration of the UK Homes for Ukraine program[102] to give caseworkers employed by local authorities access to data held by the [[Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities]] and [[Home Office]].
In November 2023, [[NHS England]] awarded Palantir a 7-year contract for a federated data platform to access data from different systems through a single system, worth £330 million, criticized by the [[British Medical Association]], [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors Association UK]] and cybersecurity professionals.[103][104][105] In 2024, medical professionals picketed outside NHS England HQ, demanding cancellation of the deal.[106]
As of May 2025, four US federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], used Foundry.[24]
It was created in tandem with credit processing company [[First Data]].[107]
The company demonstrated its use in war, where a military operator could deploy operations and receive responses via an AI chatbot.[108][109] Citing potential risks of [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative artificial intelligence]], Karp said the product would not let the AI independently carry out targeting operations, but would require human oversight.[110][111] Commercial companies have also used AIP across many domains.

The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovers trends, relationships, and anomalies, including predictive analytics.[123] Aided by 120 "forward-deployed engineers" of Palantir in 2009, Peter Cavicchia III of JPMorgan used Metropolis to monitor employee communications[124] and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed signs of potential disgruntlement: the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel.[123][124] The Metropolis team used emails, download activity, browser histories, and GPS locations from JPMorgan-owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search, aggregate, sort, and analyze this information for specific keywords, phrases, and patterns of behavior.[123][124] In 2013, Cavicchia may have shared this information with Frank Bisignano, who had become CEO of [[First Data Corporation]].[123] Palantir Metropolis was succeeded by Palantir Foundry.[125]
Palantir's software was used by the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets to better screen the entities receiving stimulus funds.[59] Other clients as of 2019 included Polaris Project,[135] the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]],[62] the National Institutes of Health,[136] Team Rubicon,[137] and the United Nations World Food Programme.[138]
Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the [[United States Intelligence Community]] and [[United States Department of Defense]], fraud investigators at the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]], and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).
Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]], a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015.
Other clients as of 2013 included [[DHS]], [[NSA]], [[FBI]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies.
Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and [[FBI]] were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually.

Liam Fox encouraged the firm "to expand their software business" in Britain.[150] It was said to be "critical to the success of the vaccination and PPE programmes", but its involvement with the NHS was controversial among civil liberties groups.[151] Conservative MP [[David Davis]] called for a judicial review into the sharing of patient data with Palantir.[152]
The procurement of a £480m Federated Data Platform by [[NHS England]], launched in January 2023, has been called a "must win" for Palantir.[153] The procurement has been called a "farce" by civil liberties campaigners who allege that Palantir has a competitive advantage as it "already has its feet under the table in NHS England" and benefits from a short procurement window.[154] In April 2023 it was revealed that a consortium of UK companies had unsuccessfully bid for the contract.[155]
In March 2023, it was revealed that NHS hospitals had been ordered to share patient data with Palantir, prompting renewed criticism from civil liberties groups, including for supporting genocide, privacy and security practices, and "buying their way in".[104][158] Groups including the [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors' Association UK]], National Pensioners' Convention, and Just Treatment subsequently threatened legal action over NHS England's procurement of the FDP contract, citing concerns over the use of patient data.[159]
In 2022, Palantir recruited [[NHS England]]'s former artificial intelligence chief, Indra Joshi.
In 2024, Irish politician and former Palantir employee Eoin Hayes was suspended by his party, the [[Social Democrats]], for saying at a press conference that he had sold shares in Palantir before he entered politics, when he had sold the shares a month after being elected as a city councillor.
Palantir's partnership with [[Anduril Industries]] extends to many areas.
Palantir also partners with the traditional defense "primes": Boeing (specifically its defense and space unit),[197] Lockheed Martin,[198] [[Northrop Grumman]] (TITAN system),[199] and General Dynamics (through General Dynamics Land System).[200]
Palantir has been criticized for its role in expanding government surveillance using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition software]].[21][22] Some former employees and critics say the company's contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|second Trump Administration]], which enable [[Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump|deportations]] and the aggregation of sensitive data on Americans across administrative agencies, are problematic.[23][24] Others observe that Palantir does not collect or store data, but only helps analyze data that customers have already collected and provides services and platforms where customers retain the rights.

Palantir's participation in "HHS Protect Now", a program launched by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to track the spread of the coronavirus, attracted criticism from US lawmakers.[252]
The German version of the Marxist[275] publication Jacobin has written that while Palantir does not steal data or carry out surveillance activity, its increased power in Germany is still worrisome, considering the founders' non-democratic tendencies, and that [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and Alliance 90/The Greens also carry responsibility.[276] The European has written that Thiel and Karp cause themselves trouble by trying to creating a mysterious aura, which leads to a negative reaction to Palantir software despite its usefulness in civilian and defense applications.[277]
