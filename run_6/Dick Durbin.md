A member of the [[Democratic Party]], Durbin is in his fifth Senate term and has served since 2005 as the Senate Democratic Whip (the second-highest position in the Democratic leadership in the Senate) and since 2025 as the Senate minority whip.
Durbin chaired the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] from 2021 to 2025,[2] and led the Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination hearings.
He graduated from the School of Foreign Service and the [[Georgetown University Law Center]].
He has served as the Senate Democratic whip since 2005—under [[Harry Reid]] until 2017, and under [[Chuck Schumer]] since 2017.
He earned a B.S. from the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]] in 1966.
Durbin earned his J.D. from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in 1969 and was admitted to the Illinois bar later that year.
He was legal counsel to Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon from 1969 to 1972, and then legal counsel to the [[Illinois State Senate]] Judiciary Committee from 1972 to 1982.
Durbin's campaign emphasized unemployment and financial difficulties facing farmers, and told voters that electing him would send "a message to Washington and to President Reagan that our economic policies are not working." Durbin also benefited from donations by pro-Israel groups, especially AIPAC,[10] that opposed Findley's advocacy on behalf of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].[11] In the years before the 1996 Senate election Durbin was reelected to the House six times, rarely facing substantial opposition and winning more than 55% of the vote in each election except 1994.[12][13][14]
In 1996, Durbin defeated [[Pat Quinn]] to become the Democratic nominee to replace the retiring Senator Paul Simon, a longtime friend.
Although the election had been expected to be competitive, Durbin benefited from [[Bill Clinton]]'s 18-point win in Illinois that year and defeated Salvi by 15 points.
In November 1998, Senate Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]] appointed Durbin Assistant Democratic Whip.
In 2000, Democratic presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] reportedly considered asking Durbin to be his running mate for Vice President of the United States.[23] Gore ultimately chose Connecticut Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].[24]
When Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] faced a difficult reelection fight in 2010, some pundits predicted a possibly heated fight to succeed him between Durbin and Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], who is well known for his fund-raising prowess.[25] Reid's reelection rendered such speculation moot.
In 2006, the [[National Journal]] rated Durbin as the most liberal U.S. senator.[27] According to the 2019 Govtrack report card, he had the 10th-most left-leaning voting record in the Senate.[28]
The [[American Conservative Union]] gave him a 5% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[29]
In September 2020, Durbin voted to confirm judges [[Stephen McGlynn]] and David W.
In July 2017, Durbin and Senators [[Cory Booker]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], and [[Kamala Harris]] introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, legislation implementing a ban on the shackling of pregnant women and mandating that the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] form superior visitation policies for parents and provide parenting classes and health products such as tampons and pads.
Durbin received an "F" grade from the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) for his consistent support for gun control.[38] Durbin supports a national assault weapon ban.[39]
Durbin sent Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] a letter in May 2017 asking for support in expanding the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s violence prevention programs by expanding access to the Strategic Decision Support Centers and the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network.
He also asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to support the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, which would stop illegal state-to-state gun trafficking.[40]
After the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Durbin was one of 24 senators to sign a letter to [[National Institutes of Health]] Director [[Francis Collins]] espousing the view that it was critical that the NIH "dedicate a portion of its resources to the public health consequences of gun violence" at a time when 93 Americans die per day from gun-related fatalities and noted that the Dickey Amendment did not prohibit objective, scientific inquiries into shooting death prevention.[43]
In December 2007, Durbin and two other senators co-sponsored Senator [[John Kerry]]'s Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act.
In April 2018, Durbin was one of five senators to send acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement [[Thomas Homan]] a letter about standards the agency used to determine how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody except in extraordinary circumstances after reports "that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detention—resulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes".[48]
Durbin and Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] led all 50 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus in writing Blagojevich to urge him to resign and not name a successor to Obama following Blagojevich's arrest.[77]
On February 12, 1999, Durbin joined all Democrats in the Senate in voting to acquit [[Bill Clinton]] on both impeachment articles in Clinton's impeachment trial.
In his 1982 campaign, Durbin benefited from donations by pro-Israel groups, especially AIPAC,[10][106] that opposed Paul Findley's advocacy on behalf of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in the year before the election.[11]
