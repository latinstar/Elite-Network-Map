The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] organization responsible for national and international counterterrorism efforts.[3] It is based in Liberty Crossing in McLean, Virginia.[4] The NCTC advises the United States on terrorism.
Part of the [[Director of National Intelligence|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], the center brings together specialists from other federal agencies, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].[5]
The idea of a center to merge intelligence on terror threats was proposed by the [[11 Commission|9/11 Commission]] following the completion of its investigation into the September 11 attacks, the deadliest attack in world history.[6] Plans to create such a center were announced by President George W.
In 2004, the center was renamed the NCTC and placed under the [[United States Director of National Intelligence]] by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act.
After the Christmas 2009 terrorist attempt on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]], the NCTC was tasked with creating a process to "thoroughly and exhaustively" prioritize terrorism threat threads; identify follow-up action by intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security; and enhance the "Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment" database, to add names to watchlists.[9]
In 2012, United States attorney general [[Eric Holder]] granted the NCTC the authority to collect, store, and analyze extensive data collections on U.S. citizens compiled from governmental and non-governmental sources for suspicious behavior through pattern analysis and to share the databases with foreign states.
The effort has drawn controversy for its pre-crime effort, which has been likened to the [[Information Awareness Office]] and its proposed mass surveillance.[10][11][12][13]
The center analyzes terrorism intelligence including potential domestic threat intelligence; monitors communications internationally and domestically for potential threats; generates actionable information to potentially prevent criminal acts domestically; stores terrorism information; supports U.S. counterterrorism activities using information technology (IT); and plans counter-terrorism activities as directed by the [[President of the United States|president of the United States]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and the [[Homeland Security Council]].
It provides terrorism information to the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]]; makes detailed lists of terrorists, terrorist groups, and worldwide terrorist incidents; supports the response to terrorist incidents in the United States and worldwide; and writes assessments and briefings for policymakers.
The NCTC has access to various databases, including those from the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and is in charge of the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) database.[15] It also operates the publicly accessible Worldwide Incidents Tracking System database.
