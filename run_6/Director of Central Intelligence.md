The director of central intelligence (DCI) was the head of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1946 to 2004, acting as the principal intelligence advisor to the president of the United States and the [[United States National Security Council]], as well as the coordinator of intelligence activities among and between the various US intelligence agencies (collectively known as the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] from 1981 onwards).
This 1947 Act also merged the prior National Intelligence Authority (NIA) into the newly established [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC).
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and the subsequent investigation by the [[11 Commission|9/11 Commission]], a movement grew to re-organize the Intelligence Community.
Goss]], became the first director of the CIA while [[John Negroponte]] became the first DNI.
During his tenure, a National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects, June 18, 1948, (NSC 10/2) further gave the CIA the authority to carry out covert operations "against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons."[25] Those operations, however, were initially conducted by other agencies such as the [[Office of Policy Coordination]].
Supposedly justified by the desire to match and defeat Soviet actions throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, it undertook a task that many believed could be accomplished only through an approach similar to the Soviet intelligence agencies, under names including [[NKVD]], [[Ministry of Internal Affairs|MVD]], [[NKGB]], MGB, and [[KGB]].
The rapid expansion of the CIA, and a developed sense of independence under the DCI [[Allen Dulles]] exacerbated the problem of the US Intelligence Community's freedom from independent review.
He was then replaced by his deputy, [[Richard Helms]].
In the early 1970s, partially as a result of the Watergate affair break-ins under President Richard Nixon, the [[United States Congress]] took a more active role in intelligence agencies, as did independent commissions such as the 1975 [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States]], also called the Rockefeller Commission after its chairman.
The ease of Helms's role under President Lyndon Johnson changed with the arrival of President Richard Nixon and Nixon's national security advisor [[Henry Kissinger]].
[[William Colby]] was another intelligence professional who was promoted to the top job.
His autobiography was entitled "Honorable Men", and he believed that a nation had to believe such people made up its intelligence service.[30] In December 1974, investigative journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] broke the news of the "Family Jewels" (leaked to him by Colby) in a front-page article in The New York Times, revealing that the CIA had assassinated foreign leaders, and had conducted surveillance on some seven thousand American citizens involved in the antiwar movement (Operation CHAOS).
Congress responded to the "Family Jewels" in 1975, investigating the CIA in the Senate via the [[Church Committee]], chaired by Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho), and in the House of Representatives via the [[Pike Committee]], chaired by Congressman Otis Pike (D-NY).
President Gerald Ford created the aforementioned [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]], and issued an Executive Order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders.
Bush]]'s confirmation as the director of central intelligence was opposed by many politicians and citizens who were still reeling from the Watergate scandal (when Bush was the head of the [[Republican National Committee]], and a steadfast defender of Nixon[citation needed]) and the [[Church Committee]] investigations.
[[The Washington Post]], [[George Will]], and Senator Frank Church were some notable figures opposed to Bush's nomination.
Bush was given 90 days to implement the new order, which called for a major reorganization of the American Intelligence Community and firmly stated that intelligence activities could not be directed against American citizens.[33] In his capacity as DCI, Bush gave national security briefings to [[Jimmy Carter]] both as a presidential candidate and as president-elect, and discussed the possibility of remaining in that position in a Carter administration.[34]
A US Naval Academy classmate of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s, Turner enjoyed the confidence of the White House, but his emphasis on technical methods of intelligence collection, such as SIGINT and IMINT, and his apparent dislike for, and firing of, HUMINT specialists made him quite unpopular within the CIA.
During Turner's term as head of the CIA, he became outraged when former agent [[Frank Snepp]] published a book called Decent Interval which exposed incompetence among senior American government personnel during the fall of Saigon.[36] accused Snepp of breaking the secrecy agreement required of all CIA agents, and then later was forced to admit under cross-examination that he had never read the agreement signed by Snepp.[37] Regardless, the CIA ultimately won its case against Snepp at the [[US Supreme Court]].
Notably he oversaw covert assistance to the mujahadeen resistance in Afghanistan, with a budget of over $1 billion, working closely with [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] (the director general of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence directorate).
In his 1987 book,[41] [[The Washington Post]] reporter [[Bob Woodward]], who had interviewed Casey on numerous occasions, said that he had gained entry to Casey's hospital room for a final, four-minute-long encounter—a claim that was met with disbelief in many quarters, and adamant denial by Casey's wife, Sofia.
Webster]] came from a legal background, including serving as a federal judge and as the [[Director of the FBI|director of the FBI]].
[[Robert Gates]] was nominated to become the director of central intelligence in early 1987.
According to the journalist [[Richard Miniter]]:
Another quotation about his relationship with Clinton, according to Paula Kaufman of [[Insight|Insight magazine]]:
While the director of central intelligence has typically been replaced by an incoming administration ever since President [[Jimmy Carter]] replaced DCI [[George H.
After the September 11, 2001, attacks, many observers criticized the [[U.S. Intelligence Community|American Intelligence Community]] for numerous "intelligence failures" as one of the major reasons why the attacks were not prevented.[54] In August 2007, part of a secret report written by the CIA Inspector General was made public (originally written in 2005 but kept secret).
[[Bob Woodward]], in his book Plan of Attack,[57] wrote that Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq.
During his junior year at Yale, [[Porter Goss]] was recruited by the CIA.
Goss was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, telling [[The Washington Post]] in 2002 that he had done some "small-boat handling" and had "some very interesting moments in the Florida Straits."[citation needed]
After growing pressure, Congress established the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001]], a joint inquiry of the two intelligence committees, led by Goss and Senator Bob Graham.
It is about where are the gaps in America's defense and what do we do about it type of investigation."[59] The inquiry's final report was released in December 2002 and focused entirely on the CIA and [[FBI]]'s activities, including no information on the White House's activities.
