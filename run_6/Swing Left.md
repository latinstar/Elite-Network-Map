Swing Left is a progressive political group with Hybrid PAC status in the United States that was created following the election of [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 with a goal of gaining a [[Democratic Party|Democratic]] majority in United States legislatures.
Swing Left was the idea of Ethan Todras-Whitehill, a long-time Democrat who gained interest in starting the platform after being "flabbergasted and devastated" following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election.[1] Todras-Whitehill urged his friends Josh Krafchin, a developer, and Josh's wife, Miriam Stone, a brand strategist, to reach out to developers and designers to help get the organization get off the ground.[1] The group ended up finding marketing strategist Michelle Finocchi and advisor Matt Ewing to focus on outreach and community organization.[4] Todras-Whitehill initially decided to focus on gaining a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives which, at the time of Swing Left's founding, was controlled by the [[Republican Party]], because it seemed "tangible".
Since its launch on January 19, 2017, Swing Left has recruited 300,000 volunteers and raised millions of dollars in donations.[5] It has partnered with the [[Daily Kos]] and [[ActBlue]] with the goal of raising $100,000 for each of its targeted swing districts.[6] Swing Left has created sub-chapters, including 31st Street Swing Left, which focuses on the Maryland, Virginia, and D.C area;[7] 31st Street Swing Left focuses on funding campaigns of swing-candidates in their jurisdiction.[8] In May 2017, [[Onward Together]] named Swing Left as one of the groups whose work it would support.[9] In December 2017, [[Crooked Media]] announced a joint fundraising initiative with Swing Left called the Crooked Seven, to raise money for the eventual Democratic challengers of seven [[Republican Party|Republican]]-controlled House districts that [[Hillary Clinton]] won in 2016.[10] Swing Left engages in phone banking, town halls, organizing events, and voter registration drives.[11]
Some notable donors of Swing Left include [[George Soros]], [[Chris Sacca]], and Tom Ford as well as organizations like [[Onward Together]] and Majority Forward.[12] In 2020, days after [[Michael Bloomberg]] dropped out of the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic campaign for president]], he donated $2 million to the organization, saying that the organization would help with the ultimate goal of "defeating [[Donald Trump]]".[13] During the 2020 election cycle, Swing Left raised over $15 million, which was donated to different Democratic candidates in swing districts.[14]
In 2018, Swing Left launched a campaign titled "The Last Weekend", where they partnered with Mandy Patinkin, Tracee Ellis Ross, [[Elizabeth Warren]], [[Anna Wintour]], and [[Kerry Washington]], to encourage people to get out and vote through a series of videos.[21] "The Last Weekend" also hosted a variety fundraising events in which they hosted performers Beck, David Grohl, and Karen O.[22]
