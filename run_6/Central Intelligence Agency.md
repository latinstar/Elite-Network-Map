The agency is headquartered in the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence]] in Langley, Virginia, and is sometimes metonymously called "Langley".
A major member of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA has reported to the director of national intelligence since 2004, and is focused on providing intelligence for the president and the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], though it also provides intelligence for a variety of other entities including the [[US Military]] and foreign allies.
The CIA is headed by a director and is divided into various directorates, including a Directorate of Analysis and [[Directorate of Operations]].
In 1975, the [[Church Committee]] of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] revealed illegal operations such as MKUltra and CHAOS, after which greater oversight was imposed.
In the 1980s, the CIA supported the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and Nicaraguan Contras, and after the September 11 attacks in 2001, played a role in the Global War on Terrorism.
The Executive Office also supports the U.S. military, including the [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]], by providing it with information it gathers, receiving information from military intelligence organizations, and cooperating with field activities.
Each branch of the agency has its own director.[9] The Office of Military Affairs (OMA), subordinate to the associate deputy director, manages the relationship between the CIA and the [[Unified Combatant Command|Unified Combatant Commands]], who produce and deliver regional and operational intelligence and consume national intelligence produced by the CIA.[13]
The development of the U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, for instance, was done in cooperation with the [[United States Air Force]].
Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who served as the ranking member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], endorsed the reorganization.
The Office of Congressional Affairs (OCA) serves as the liaison between the CIA and the [[US Congress]].
In response, Director of Central Intelligence [[George Tenet]] established [[CIA University]] in 2002.[29][14] CIA University holds between 200 and 300 courses each year, training both new hires and experienced intelligence officers, as well as CIA support staff.[29][30] The facility works in partnership with the [[National Intelligence University]], and includes the [[Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis]], the Directorate of Analysis' component of the university.[14][31][32]
There were numerous previous attempts to obtain general information about the budget.[39] As a result, reports revealed that CIA's annual budget in Fiscal Year 1963 was $550 million (equivalent to US$5.6 billion in 2024),[40] and the overall intelligence budget in FY 1997 was US$26.6 billion (equivalent to US$52.1 billion in 2024).[41] There have been accidental disclosures; for instance, [[Mary Margaret Graham]], a former CIA official and deputy director of national intelligence for collection in 2005, said that the annual intelligence budget was $44 billion,[42] and in 1994 Congress accidentally published a budget of $43.4 billion (in 2012 dollars) in 1994 for the non-military National Intelligence Program, including $4.8 billion for the CIA.[3]
The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in [[Cabinet of Germany|Germany]], [[MI6]] in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the [[Foreign Intelligence Service]] in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the [[General Intelligence Service]] in Egypt, [[Mossad]] in [[Cabinet of Israel|Israel]], and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea.
The CIA was instrumental in the establishment of intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, including Germany's BND and Greece's [[National Intelligence Service|EYP]] (then known as KYP).[44][citation needed]
The first public mention of the "Central Intelligence Agency" appeared on a command-restructuring proposal presented by [[Jim Forrestal]] and [[Arthur Radford]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945.[50] Army Intelligence agent Colonel Sidney Mashbir and Commander Ellis Zacharias worked together for four months at the direction of [[Ernest King|Fleet Admiral Joseph Ernest King]], and prepared the first draft and implementing directives for the creation of what would become the Central Intelligence Agency.[51][52][53] Despite opposition from the military establishment, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),[54] Truman established the [[National Intelligence Authority]][55] in January 1946.
Lawrence Houston, head counsel of the SSU, CIG, and, later CIA, was principal draftsman of the National Security Act of 1947,[59][60][61] which dissolved the NIA and the CIG, and established both the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the Central Intelligence Agency.[56][62] In 1949, Houston helped to draft the Central Intelligence Agency Act (Pub.
The CIA still lacked its intelligence-gathering abilities.[65] On August 21, 1950, shortly after, Truman announced [[Walter Bedell Smith]] as the new Director of the CIA.
On June 18, 1948, the [[National Security Council]] issued Directive 10/2[71] calling for covert action against the Soviet Union,[72] and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against "hostile foreign states or groups" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government.
To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was created inside the CIA.[73] The OPC was unique; [[Frank Wisner]], the head of the OPC, answered not to the CIA Director, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC.
It included information linking the CIA to the assassination of foreign leaders, the illegal surveillance of some 7,000 U.S. citizens involved in the antiwar movement (Operation CHAOS), its experiments on U.S. and Canadian citizens without their knowledge, secretly giving them LSD (among other things) and observing the results.[148] This prompted Congress to create the [[Church Committee]] in the Senate, and the Pike Committee in the House.
In Afghanistan, the CIA funneled several billion dollars' worth of weapons,[160] including FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles,[161] to Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)—which funneled them to tens of thousands of [[Afghan mujahideen]] resistance fighters in order to fight the Soviets and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War.[162][163][164] In total, the CIA sent approximately 2,300 Stingers to Afghanistan, creating a substantial black market for the weapons throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, and even parts of Africa that persisted well into the 1990s.
In 1997 the House would pen another report, which said that CIA officers know little about the language or politics of the people they spy on; the conclusion was that the CIA lacked the "depth, breadth, and expertise to monitor political, military, and economic developments worldwide."[195] Russ Travers said in the CIA in-house journal that in five years "intelligence failure is inevitable".[196] In 1997 the CIA's new director [[George Tenet]] would promise a new working agency by 2002.
Allen to set up a "Qaeda cell" to oversee its tactical execution.[204] In 2000, the CIA and [[United States Air Force|USAF]] jointly ran a series of flights over Afghanistan with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance drone, the Predator; they obtained probable photos of bin Laden.
The report concluded that former DCI [[George Tenet]] failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by al-Qaeda prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.[214] The report was finished in June 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with Congress, over the objections of current DCI General Michael Hayden.
The program was exposed by the [[Church Committee]] in 1975 as a part of the investigation into the Watergate scandal.[217][269]
