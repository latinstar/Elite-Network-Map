An agency of the [[United States Department of Justice]], the FBI is a member of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] and reports to both the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]].[3] A leading American counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.[4][5]  The FBI maintains a list of its top 10 most wanted fugitives.
Although many of the FBI's functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and [[National Crime Agency|NCA]] and the Russian FSB.
In 1896, the [[National Bureau of Criminal Identification]] was founded, providing agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals.
The [[United States Department of Justice|Departments of Justice]] and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them.[14]
President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]].[15]
Bonaparte contacted other agencies, including the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], for personnel, investigators in particular.
Its first "chief" (the title is now "director") was [[Stanley Finch]].
The following year, 1933, the BOI was linked to the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] and rechristened the Division of Investigation (DOI); it became an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935.[18] In the same year, its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the [[FBI Laboratory]], which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government.
Earlier, through the work of [[Edwin Atherton]], the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid-1920s, east of San Diego, California.
The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the FBI Index list.[23] Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor.[24][better source needed] Mass arrests and searches of homes, in most cases conducted without warrants, began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.[25]
Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by [[Sam Giancana]] and John Gotti.
Named the [[Hostage Rescue Team]], or HRT, it acts as a dedicated FBI SWAT team dealing primarily with counter-terrorism scenarios.
In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had "not been well served" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI.[59] While the FBI did accede to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new [[Director of National Intelligence|director of National Intelligence]], some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.[60]
The FBI's mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code (U.S. Code), Section 533, which authorizes the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to "appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States".[76] Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes.
The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ).
The [[FBI Laboratory]], established with the formation of the BOI,[88] did not appear in the J.
Since then, the director now reports to the [[Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]] (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.
Special agents of the FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT) and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Armory Professional Model 1911 pistol in .45 ACP.[108][109][110]
The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, terrorism, cybercrime, white-collar crime, violent crime, and statistics.[118] The vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the [[United States Department of Justice]], and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service.
During the 1920s the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments.[119] Due to limitations of this system that were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s—victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place—the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] developed an alternative method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.[119]
