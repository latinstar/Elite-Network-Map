It emerged as the main rival of the [[Democratic Party]] in the 1850s, and the two parties have dominated American politics since then.
Since 2009, internal divisions have grown, leading to a shift toward right-wing populism,[20] which ultimately became its dominant faction.[9] This culminated in the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump]], whose leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as Trumpism—reshaped the party's identity.[17][18][19] By the 2020s, the party has increasingly shifted towards illiberalism.[21] In the 21st century, the Republican Party's strongest demographics are rural voters, White Southerners, evangelical Christians, men, senior citizens, and voters without college degrees.
In the 2016 presidential election, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] defeated Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].
Over the course of his presidency, Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court: [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]].[52] He was impeached by the House of Representatives in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress but was acquitted by the Senate in 2020.[53] Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to [[Joe Biden]] but refused to concede the race, claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results.
Despite those disappointments, Trump easily won the nomination to be the party's candidate again in 2024, marking the third straight election of him being the GOP nominee.[72] Trump – who survived an ear injury in an assassination attempt during the campaign – achieved victory against Vice President [[Kamala Harris]], who replaced President Biden on the Democratic ticket after his withdrawal in July.
There have been 19 Republicans who have served as president, the most from any one political party,[74] the most recent being current president [[Donald Trump]], who became the 47th president on January 20, 2025.
Bush were colored red and states won by Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] were colored blue.
Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September 11 attacks through the war on terror.[96] The election of [[Barack Obama]] saw the formation of the [[Tea Party movement]] in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in right-wing populist movements from the 2010s to 2020s.[97] The global rise in right-wing populism has been attributed to factors including economic insecurity due to financialization,[98] a decline in organized religion, backlash to globalization, and migrant crises.[99][100]
Right-wing populism became an increasingly dominant ideological faction within the GOP throughout the 2010s and helped lead to the election of [[Donald Trump]] in 2016.[42] Starting in the 1970s and accelerating in the 2000s, American right-wing interest groups invested heavily in external mobilization vehicles that led to the organizational weakening of the GOP establishment.
The outsize role of conservative media, in particular [[Fox News]], led to it being followed and trusted more by the Republican base over traditional party elites.
The Party has since faced intense factionalism.[103][104] These factions are particularly apparent in the U.S. House of Representatives, where three Republican House leaders ([[Eric Cantor]], [[John Boehner]], and Kevin McCarthy) have been ousted since 2009.[105][106][107][108][109][110] All three of the top Republican elected officials during Trump's first term (Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate Republican leader) were ousted or stepped down by Trump's second term.
The Republican Party's right-wing populist movements emerged in concurrence with a global increase in populist movements in the 2010s and 2020s,[97][100] coupled with entrenchment and increased partisanship within the party since 2010.[138] This included the rise of the [[Tea Party movement]], which has also been described as far-right.[139] This faction gained further dominance in the GOP during Joe Biden's presidency (2021–2025), including in the aftermath of the 2021–2023 inflation surge and Russian invasion of Ukraine.[140]
Hopkins, the Republican Party's gains among white voters without college degrees and corresponding losses among white voters with college degrees contributed to the rise of right-wing populism.[160] Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group, but have since become a Democratic-leaning group.[161] In the 2020 presidential election, [[Joe Biden]] became the first Democratic president to win a majority of white voters with college degrees (51–48%) since 1964, while Trump won white voters without college degrees 67–32%.[162][163][164]
Demographically, the party has lost majority support from white voters with college degrees, while continuing to gain among voters without college degrees.[217][164][160][119] Higher educational attainment is strongly correlated with higher income, as well as decreased support for Trump and social conservatism.[119] In the 2024 presidential election, Democrat [[Kamala Harris]] won a majority of voters with annual incomes over $100,000 (51–47%) and $200,000 (52–46%).
During the 2024 United States elections, the Republican Party adopted pro-cryptocurrency policies, which were originally advocated by the libertarian wing of the party.[252] As the Republican presidential nominee, [[Donald Trump]] addressed the 2024 Libertarian National Convention, pledging support for cryptocurrency, opposing central bank digital currency and expressing support for the commutation of Ross Ulbricht.[253] Trump's 2024 campaign featured greater influence from technolibertarian elements, particularly Elon Musk, who was subsequently nominated to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).[254][255][256]
Enacting high tariffs on foreign imports is a core component of [[Donald Trump]]'s fiscal agenda.
Bush[437] and [[Donald Trump]] described themselves as "pro-life" during their terms.
In 2016, [[Donald Trump]] proposed to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.
Bush campaigned prominently on a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage; many believe it helped Bush win re-election.[493][494] In both 2004[495] and 2006,[496] President Bush, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, and House Majority Leader [[John Boehner]] promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples.[497][498][499] In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture and thus ultimately was never passed.
In the 2024 presidential election, Trump did better among lower-income voters than high-income voters, the first time ever for the Republican nominee in modern American political history.[568] Trump lost voters making annual incomes over $100,000 (47–51%) and $200,000 (46–52%) to Democrat [[Kamala Harris]], with voters making over $200,000 a year being Trump's weakest income demographic.
[[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in the 2024 United States presidential election as White voters without college degrees still strongly backed him, in addition to the gains made with Asian and Latino voters in comparison to the 2020 United States presidential election.
