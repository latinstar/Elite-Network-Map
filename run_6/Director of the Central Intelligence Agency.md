The director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) is a statutory office (50 U.S.C. § 3036) that functions as the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which in turn is a part of the [[United States Intelligence Community]].
The director reports to the director of national intelligence (DNI) and is assisted by the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] (DD/CIA).
The director is a civilian or a general or flag officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]][2] nominated by the president of the United States, with the recommendation from the DNI,[3] and must be confirmed by a majority vote of the [[United States Senate]].[4]
Before December 17, 2004 the director of central intelligence (DCI) headed both the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] and the Central Intelligence Agency.
In addition, DCI served as an advisor to the president of the United States on intelligence matters and was the statutory intelligence advisor to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].
After the end of World War II, the [[Office of Strategic Services]] was dismantled.
Its functions were split between the departments of state and war.[6] Truman soon recognized the inefficiency of this arrangement and created the [[Central Intelligence Group]],[7] which could be considered a smaller precursor to the National Security Council.[8]  The following year the National Security Act of 1947 created the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council, while formally defining the duties of the director of Central Intelligence.
Beginning in February 2017, the D/CIA was elevated to [[Cabinet of the United States]] level status, as designated by the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].
This ended with the beginning of the [[Presidency of Joe Biden|Biden administration]].[9] In July 2023, the D/CIA was once again elevated to [[Cabinet of the United States]] level status by the Biden administration.[10]
