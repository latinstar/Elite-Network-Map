The company is controlled by [[Lachlan Murdoch]] through a family trust with 36% voting shares.[12][13] [[Rupert Murdoch]] is chairman emeritus, while his son [[Lachlan Murdoch]] is chairman and CEO.
Its assets include [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], [[Fox Television Stations]], [[Fox News]], [[Fox Business]], Fox Sports, Tubi, Fox One and others.
Murdoch's newspaper interests and other media assets are held by [[News Corp]], which is also under his control and was split from [[News Corporation]] in 2013, alongside 21CF.
On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced its intent to acquire the motion picture, television production, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions of 21st Century Fox (the former [[News Corporation]], which spun off its publishing assets in 2013), including 20th Century Fox and [[FX Networks]], for $52.4 billion.
The remainder of the company would form a so-called "New Fox", maintaining control of assets such as Fox's television network and broadcast stations (which Disney, already owning [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], would be legally unable to own due to an [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] policy known as the "dual network rule", which prohibits mergers between the top broadcast networks), [[Fox News]], the national operations of Fox Sports, and the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would be leased to Disney for seven years.
Fox's regional sports networks were also included in the sale, but were later divested by order of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], on the grounds that the Fox regional networks' combination with Disney's 80% ownership of ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market.[15][16][17][18][19]
In May 2018, it was confirmed that [[Lachlan Murdoch]], rather than [[James Murdoch]], would take charge of the New Fox company.[4]
In mid-2018, [[NBCUniversal]]'s parent company [[Comcast]] instigated bidding wars over both the Fox assets Disney planned to purchase, and the British broadcaster [[Sky|Sky plc]] (a company that 21st Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning to acquire the remainder).
On October 10, 2018, it was reported that in preparation for the impending completion of the sale, the new, post-merger organizational structure of "New Fox" would be implemented by January 1, 2019.[5] On November 14, 2018, it was revealed that the new independent company would maintain the original Fox name.[23] On January 7, 2019, Fox Corporation's registration statement was filed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].[24]
On January 11, 2019, Fox stated in a securities filing that it had no plans to bid on its former regional sports networks;[8] they would instead go to a consortium led by [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], with Fox Corp continuing to license the FSN name to those stations until Sinclair developed a new brand (the networks would eventually become Bally Sports).[25] On March 12, 2019, Disney announced that the sale would be completed by March 20, 2019.[26] On March 19, 2019, Fox Corp officially began trading on the S&P 500, replacing 21st Century Fox on the index.[10] Republican politician and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Paul Ryan]] also joined Fox Corp's board at this time.[3]
In early July 2019, Fox Entertainment announced the formation of SideCar, with executives led by [[Gail Berman]].
In August 2019, Fox Corp acquired a 67-percent majority stake in Credible Labs for $397 million and animation studio Bento Box Entertainment for $50 million.[32][33][34] On April 20, 2020, Fox Corp acquired streaming service Tubi for $440 million.[35][36] In September 2021, Fox Corp acquired TMZ from [[WarnerMedia]] in a deal worth about $50 million, with TMZ being operated under the [[Fox Entertainment]] division.[37] In December 2021, Fox Corp acquired the film and television production studio MarVista Entertainment.[38][39]
On October 14, 2022, it was announced that, under the instruction of Rupert Murdoch, a special committee had been established to explore a potential merger of Fox and [[News Corp]], bringing the two companies back together since the former 21st Century Fox was spun-off from News Corp in 2013.[42]  Although [[Lachlan Murdoch]] supported his father in the proposal, [[James Murdoch]] opposed it, as did many shareholders.[43] On January 24, 2023, the proposed merger was abandoned by Murdoch.[44][45]
This would be a standalone digital business unit, encompassing Tubi, Credible Labs, Blockchain Creative Labs, along with several other Fox digital sports, news and entertainment platforms[46] and teams, in which [[Paul Cheesbrough]] was announced as CEO.[47][needs update]
The other siblings, [[Prudence MacLeod]], [[Elisabeth Murdoch]], and [[James Murdoch]], are more moderate politically than their father or brother, and Rupert was keen to keep the conservative political bias in his media outlets.
On December 9, 2024, [[The New York Times]] reported that the court had ruled against the Murdochs, who, the probate commissioner wrote, had acted in bad faith when trying to change the trust.[48][49]
The company consists of the former 21st Century Fox's media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] and Fox Sports Media Group.[57]
