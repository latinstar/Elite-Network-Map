The company was formed on June 28, 2013, as a spin-off of [[News Corporation|the first News Corporation]], whose legal successor was [[21st Century Fox]], which held its media and entertainment assets.
Operating across digital real estate information, news media, book publishing, and cable television, News Corp's notable assets include: [[Dow Jones & Company]], which is the publisher of [[The Wall Street Journal]]; [[News UK]], publisher of [[The Sun]] and [[The Times]]; [[News Corp Australia]]; [[REA Group]], operator of realestate.com.au and [[Realtor.com|realtor.com]]; and book publisher [[HarperCollins]].
News Corp and 21st Century Fox are two companies that succeeded the original News Corp., which included [[Fox Entertainment Group]] and other broadcasting and media properties.[4] The spin-out was structured so that 21st Century Fox was the legal continuation of the original News Corporation, with the new News Corp being a new company formed by a stock split.
Since [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|March 2019]], [[Fox Corporation]], which holds 21st Century Fox's national broadcasting, news and sports assets, is also under the [[Murdoch family]]'s control.[5][6] In September 2023, [[Rupert Murdoch]] announced he would step down as News Corp's chairman by November.[7]
On June 28, 2012, [[Rupert Murdoch]] announced that [[News Corporation]]'s publishing operations would be spun off to form a new, publicly traded company.[8][9] Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division".
The move also came in the wake of a series of [[2011 News Corporation scandals|scandals]] that had damaged the reputation of multiple News Corporation-owned properties.[8][10]
[[Robert Thomson]], then editor of [[The Wall Street Journal]], was announced as the initial chief operating officer for the company.
Preliminary trading on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] of the new News Corp's class B stock began on June 19, 2013, at around $15 per share; a value slightly lower than expected by some analysts.
The current News Corp began trading on the [[Nasdaq]] stock exchange under the symbol "NWS" on July 1, 2013; at the same time, the former News Corporation (which encompassed purely of media properties, such as [[Fox Entertainment Group]] and 20th Century Fox) was renamed [[21st Century Fox]].[17][18]
On September 4, 2013, News Corp announced that it would sell the [[Dow Jones Local Media Group]], a group of 33 local newspapers, to Newcastle Investment Corp., an affiliate of [[Fortress Investment Group]], for $87 million.
The newspapers will be operated by [[GateHouse Media]], a newspaper group owned by Fortress.
On December 20, 2013, News Corp announced its acquisition of Dublin, Ireland-based social news agency [[Storyful]],[22] a startup founded by journalist [[Mark Little]].[23] At the time, Storyful was described as "scour[ing] social-media services like Twitter and Instagram" to discover user-generated content "breaking news and viral online content" and after sourcing, to then verify, acquire, and distribute it.[22][23] Storyful had, for instance, reported 2013 results of 750m views of user-generated videos by its partners.[23] The cost of the Storyful acquisition was €18 million (£15m, US$25m),[23][22] and marked News Corp's first acquisition since the split.[22] News Corp CEO at the time, Robert Thomson, stated that the service had "become the village square for valuable video, using journalistic sensibility, integrity and creativity", and that with the acquisition, News Corp would "define the opportunities that the digital landscape presents, rather than simply adapt to them".[23]
On May 2, 2014, News Corp acquired romance novel publisher [[Harlequin Enterprises]] from [[Torstar]] for $415 million.[24] The deal closed on August 1; it is now operated as a subsidiary of News Corp's [[HarperCollins]].[25][better source needed]
On September 30, 2014, News Corp announced its acquisition of [[Move|Move, Inc.]], a real estate listings company and owner of Realtor.com, a 20% stake of which was, at the time, owned by [[REA Group]], a publicly traded subsidiary of News Corp Australia.[26]
News Corp also began making investments in India in late 2014, such as a $30 million investment in real estate site ProTiger in November,[27] the December 2014 purchase of BigDecisions.com, a financial planning website,[28] and the acquisition of Indian media firm [[VCCircle]] in March 2015.[29]
In October 2015, News Corp sold its digital education brand [[Amplify]] to a management team supported by a group of private investors for an undisclosed sum.[30] In June 2016, News Corp acquired [[Wireless Group]] (formerly [[UTV]] Media), a British radio broadcaster, for $296 million[31][32]
In January 2020, News Corp sold Unruly, an outstream video ad marketplace, in exchange of 6.91% of Tremor Video stock.[33] On July 31, 2020, [[James Murdoch]] resigned from the News Corp board of directors, "due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions."[34]
He would also retire from the board of Fox Corporation and his son [[Lachlan Murdoch]] would replace him on both boards.
An annual meeting of shareholders was held by webcast on 20 November 2024, to determine whether the "dual-class" share structure (voting and non-voting) would be abolished, after [[Starboard Value]], which has bought up a large share of News Corp over the previous year, had proposed a one-share-one-vote system.
The other siblings, [[Prudence MacLeod]], [[Elisabeth Murdoch]], and [[James Murdoch]], are more moderate politically than their father or brother, and Rupert was keen to keep the conservative political leanings in his media outlets.[41] On December 9, 2024, [[The New York Times]] reported that the court had ruled against Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, who, the probate commissioner wrote, had acted in bad faith when trying to change the trust.[43][44]
The company consists of the former [[News Corporation]]'s newspaper and book publishing assets, together with the digital real-estate advertising properties that are now its largest business.[15][45]
