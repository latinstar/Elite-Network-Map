Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired [[United States Air Force]] four-star general and former [[Director of the National Security Agency|director of the National Security Agency]], Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]].
He currently works as a visiting professor at the George Mason University – Schar School of Policy and Government and co-chairs the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]]'s Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[2]
There he initiated and oversaw the NSA surveillance of digital communications between persons in the United States and foreign citizens who allegedly had ties to terrorist groups, which resulted in the [[NSA warrantless surveillance]].
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and awarded his fourth star, making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[3]
He served on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Washington, D.C. and in senior staff positions for [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], [[U.S. European Command]] headquarters in Stuttgart, and then as deputy chief of staff for the [[United Nations Command]] and [[U.S. Forces Korea]], Yongsan Garrison.
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden remained at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, as commander of the [[Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency]].
In February of 1999 Hayden was nominated by President Bill Clinton be the director of the NSA and chief of the [[Central Security Service]] at Fort George G.
He even allowed [[James Bamford]] access for his book Body of Secrets.[10] Initially, Hayden was extremely concerned with following laws against domestic surveillance.[11][12]
Such omissions constituted a potential failure, subjecting the NSA to external critical feedback, including Diane S Roark, of the [[House Intelligence Committee]].
NSA employees [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], [[William Binney]], and [[J.
General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first Director, [[John Negroponte]].
In May 2006, [[USA Today]] reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a [[NSA call database|domestic telephone call database]].
Hayden stated that he had relied upon legal advice from the [[White House]], that warrantless surveillance would not have required a warrant from a FISA court.
Hayden has been accused of lying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[23][24] Many critics of enhanced interrogation techniques maintain that they were torture and did not yield reliable information from CIA detainees.[25] Hayden said the notion that enhanced interrogation never yields useful intelligence is not credible and is merely the opinion of "interrogation deniers".[25] The 2014 [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] cited an email indicating that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[26]
In his memoir, [[Leon Panetta]] said that Hayden had hoped to be retained as CIA director by the Obama administration.[28] Panetta was appointed instead.
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called [[Edward Snowden]] a "troubled young man" and "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree".[29]
In December 2013, after the [[P5+1]] reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[30]
Hayden worked for a number of years as a principal at the [[Michael Chertoff|Chertoff Group]], a security consultancy, but left at the end of 2022.
He serves on the board of directors of the [[Atlantic Council]],[31] and co-founded the [[Michael V.
Hayden is currently on the advisory board of [[NewsGuard]].[32]
Moalin (2020), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that the NSA program of mass surveillance of Americans' telephone records violated FISA and possibly the Fourth Amendment.[35][36]
In early October 2020, he endorsed [[Joe Biden]] in the presidential election.[38]
In response to a request made by future Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken]], Hayden was one of the 51 former U.S. intelligence officials who signed an October 19, 2020, letter that said the [[Hunter Biden laptop controversy|Hunter Biden laptop story]] "has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."[39]
In reaction, General Michael Flynn said that Hayden should be arrested.[41] 
Tuberville reported Hayden to the [[United States Capitol Police]] for the comments, saying that Hayden had called for his "politically motivated assassination".[42]
On July 26, 2011, Hayden was inducted into the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] Distinguished Alumni in a ceremony at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, officiated by Lt. Gen.
Peck, commander, [[Air University]].[7] He serves as a member of the board of advisors of the Military Cyber Professionals Association (MCPA)[51]
