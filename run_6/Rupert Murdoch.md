Keith Rupert Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/ MUR-dok; born 11 March 1931) is an Australian and American former business magnate, investor, and media mogul.[3][4] Through his company [[News Corp]], he is the owner of hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets around the world, including in the United Kingdom ([[The Sun]] and [[The Times]]), in Australia ([[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Herald Sun]], and [[The Australian]]), in the United States ([[The Wall Street Journal]] and the [[New York Post]]), book publisher HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels [[Sky News Australia]] and [[Fox News]] (through  [[Fox Corporation]]).
His holding company [[News Corporation]] acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989),[10] and The Wall Street Journal (2007).
Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the United States.[12][13] On 21 July 2012, Murdoch resigned as a director of [[News International]].[14][15] In September 2023, Murdoch announced he would be stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp.
Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the second of four children of Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch (1885–1952) and Dame [[Elisabeth Murdoch|Elisabeth Joy]] (née Greene; 1909–2012).[26][27]: 9  He is of English, Irish and Scottish ancestry.
He was a member of the Oxford University [[Labour Party]],[28]: 34 [35] stood for secretary of the Labour Club[36] and managed Oxford Student Publications Limited, the publishing house of Cherwell.[37]
After his father's death from cancer in 1952, Murdoch's mother did charity work as the life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and established the Murdoch Children's Research Institute; at the age of 102 (in 2011), she had 74 descendants.[38] While his father was alive, Murdoch worked part-time at the Melbourne Herald and was groomed by his father to take over the family business.[9][35] After his father's death, he began working as a sub-editor with the [[Daily Express]] for two years.[9]
After liquidation of his father's Herald stake to pay taxes, what was left was [[News Limited]], which had been established in 1923.[28]: 16  Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, The News, its main asset, into a major success.[35] He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid The Daily Mirror (1960).
[[The Economist]] describes Murdoch as "inventing the modern tabloid",[39] as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.[9]
A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful.[40] Later in 1964, Murdoch launched [[The Australian]], Australia's first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney.[41] In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid [[The Daily Telegraph]] from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him.[42] In 1984, Murdoch was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to publishing.[43][44]
After the Keating government relaxed media ownership laws, in 1986 Murdoch launched a takeover bid for [[The Herald and Weekly Times]], which was the largest newspaper publisher in Australia.[45] There was a three-way takeover battle between Murdoch, Fairfax and Robert Holmes à Court, with Murdoch succeeding after agreeing to some divestments.
Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch's son [[James Murdoch]] for several years.[46]
Murdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the [[National Party of Australia]]), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].
After McEwen and Menzies retired, Murdoch threw his growing power behind the [[Australian Labor Party]] under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected[48] on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia's oil, gas and mineral resources.
In 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily [[The Sun]] from IPC.[55] Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Murdoch's publications were generally supportive of Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[59] At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the [[Labour Party]] and its leader, Tony Blair.
In Britain, in the 1980s, Murdoch formed a close alliance with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher.[73] In February 1981, when Murdoch, already owner of The Sun and The News of the World, sought to buy [[The Times]] and The Sunday Times, Thatcher's government let his bid pass without referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which was usual practice at the time.[74][75][76] Although contact between the two before this point had been explicitly denied in an official history of The Times, documents found in Thatcher's archives in 2012 revealed a secret meeting had taken place a month before in which Murdoch briefed Thatcher on his plans for the paper, such as taking on trade unions.[74][75][77]
On 14 July 2011 the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons served a summons on Murdoch, his son James, and his former CEO Rebekah Brooks to testify before a committee five days later.[99] After an initial refusal, the Murdochs confirmed they would attend, after the committee issued them a summons to Parliament.[100] The day before the committee, the website of the News Corporation publication [[The Sun]] was hacked, and a false story was posted on the front page claiming that Murdoch had died.[101] Murdoch described the day of the committee "the most humble day of my life".
Soon afterwards, he founded Star, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976, he purchased the [[New York Post]].[9] On 4 September 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only American citizens were permitted to own American television stations.[9]
Besides Murdoch, the Associated Press reported that supermarket magnate Ron Burkle and Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan were among the other interested parties.[130] In 2007, Murdoch acquired Dow Jones & Company,[131][132] which gave him such publications as [[The Wall Street Journal]], Barron's Magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review (based in Hong Kong) and SmartMoney.[133]
Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox in 2015 but continued to own the company until it was purchased by Disney in 2019.[136][137][138] A number of television broadcasting assets were spun off into the [[Fox Corporation]] before the acquisition and are still owned by Murdoch.
This includes [[Fox News]], of which Murdoch was acting CEO from 2016 until 2019, following the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment.[139][5]
On 8 May 2006, the Financial Times reported that Murdoch would be hosting a fund-raiser for Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign.[145] In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had "anything to do with the [[New York Post]]'s endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries".
The Wall Street Journal editorial page has similarly advocated for increased legal immigration, in contrast to the staunch anti-immigration stance of Murdoch's British newspaper, [[The Sun]].[156] On 5 September 2010, Murdoch testified before the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Membership on the "Role of Immigration in Strengthening America's Economy".
In November 1986, [[News Corporation]] purchased a 35% stake in the South China Morning Post group for about US$105 million.
In 1967, Murdoch married Anna Torv,[194] a Scottish-born cadet journalist working for his Sydney newspaper The Daily Mirror.[196] In January 1998, three months before the announcement of his separation from Anna, a Roman Catholic, Murdoch was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KSG), a papal honour awarded by Pope John Paul II.[197] While Murdoch would often attend Mass with Torv, he never converted to Catholicism.[198][199] Torv and Murdoch had three children: Elisabeth Murdoch (born in Sydney, Australia on 22 August 1968), Lachlan Murdoch (born in London, UK on 8 September 1971), and [[James Murdoch]], (born in London on 13 December 1972).[194][195] Murdoch's companies published two novels by his wife: Family Business (1988) and Coming to Terms (1991).
On 11 January 2016, Murdoch announced his engagement to former model Jerry Hall in a notice in [[The Times]] newspaper.[208] On 4 March 2016, Murdoch, a week short of his 85th birthday, and 59-year-old Hall were married in London, at St Bride's, Fleet Street with a reception at Spencer House; this was Murdoch's fourth marriage.[209] In June 2022, The New York Times reported that Murdoch and Hall were set to divorce, citing two anonymous sources.[210][211] Hall filed for divorce on 1 July 2022 citing irreconcilable differences;[212] the divorce was finalised in August 2022.[213]
Murdoch has six children.[225] His eldest child, Prudence MacLeod, was appointed on 28 January 2011 to the board of Times Newspapers Ltd, part of [[News International]], which publishes [[The Times]] and The Sunday Times.[226] Murdoch's elder son Lachlan, formerly the Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the News Corporation and publisher of the [[New York Post]], was Murdoch's heir apparent before resigning from his executive posts at the global media company at the end of July 2005.[225] Lachlan's departure left [[James Murdoch]], Chief Executive of the satellite television service British Sky Broadcasting since November 2003 as the only Murdoch son still directly involved with the company's operations, though Lachlan has agreed to remain on the News Corporation's board.[227]
In late 2015, [[The Wall Street Journal]] journalist John Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, the blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes, that questioned its claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.[268][269][270] Holmes had turned to Murdoch, whose media empire includes Carreyrou's employer, The Wall Street Journal, to kill the story.
