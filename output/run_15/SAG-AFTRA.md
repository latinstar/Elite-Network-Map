[[SAG-AFTRA]], an American labor union representing approximately 170,000 media professionals worldwide, was formed in 2012 by the merger of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], establishing its foundation in collective worker representation.

The union exerts significant influence by being a member of the [[AFL-CIO]], the largest federation of unions in the United States, and the [[International Federation of Actors]], connecting it to a broader network of global and national labor power.

[[SAG-AFTRA]]'s power dynamics are evident through its [[collective bargaining agreements]] with [[most major media firms]], primarily negotiated through the [[Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), which represents entities like [[Netflix]], [[Disney]], and [[Warner Bros.]], allowing it to shape employment standards across the entertainment industry.

Through its [[Global Rule One]], [[SAG-AFTRA]] mandates that its members must work under union contracts worldwide, demonstrating its expansive control over its members' professional activities and its ideological commitment to unionized labor globally.

[[SAG-AFTRA]] has strategically leveraged strikes to exert influence, as seen in its actions against [[video game developers]] (including [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Insomniac Games]], [[Take 2 Interactive]], and [[WB Games]]), the advertising agency [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]] (BBH), and major [[Hollywood studios]] represented by the [[AMPTP]], fighting for issues such as residuals, protection against [[artificial intelligence]], and improved working conditions.

The union actively confronts corporations, notably challenging [[Telemundo]] (a subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]]) over unfair wages and working conditions for Spanish-language performers, ultimately leading to successful unionization and a first-ever collective bargaining agreement, expanding its influence into new media sectors.

[[SAG-AFTRA]] demonstrated its political and ideological stance by barring former President [[Donald Trump]] from rejoining for perceived attacks on [[SAG-AFTRA journalists]] and his support of the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]], indicating its willingness to engage in contemporary political events.

Under the leadership of president [[Fran Drescher]] (re-elected in 2023, succeeded by [[Sean Astin]] in 2025) and National Executive Director [[Duncan Crabtree-Ireland]], [[SAG-AFTRA]] actively engages in strategic partnerships, such as the [[Green Council Initiative]] with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and other unions, involving influential figures like [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Robert Redford]], extending its influence into environmental advocacy within the entertainment industry.
