The [[United States National Security Council]] ([[NSC]]), based in the [[White House]] as part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]], serves as the president's principal arm for advising on and coordinating national security and foreign policies among various government agencies.

The [[NSC]] was established by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] to ensure coordination among military branches (including the [[Army]], [[Marine Corps]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]]) and instruments like the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] ([[CIA]]), succeeding the [[National Intelligence Authority]] ([[NIA]]).

The [[Eisenhower administration]]'s [[NSC]] developed key policy papers in 1953 aimed at opposing the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[PRC]]), which included proposals to back [[Republic of China]] raids, foster anti-communist Chinese elements, and deny the [[PRC]] full international status.

Since 2004, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] ([[DNI]]), a cabinet-level position overseeing the [[Intelligence Community]], serves as the intelligence advisor to the [[NSC]].

[[President Barack Obama]] merged the staff supporting the [[Homeland Security Council]] ([[HSC]]) and the [[NSC]] into the [[National Security Staff]] ([[NSS]]) in 2009, though the staff organization reverted to [[National Security Council Staff]] in 2014.

The [[Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense]], an [[NSC]] component formed under the [[Obama administration]], was disbanded in 2018 under the [[Trump administration]] by then-[[National Security Advisor John Bolton]], with its responsibilities absorbed into a new directorate led by [[Tim Morrison]], but was reinstated by [[President Joe Biden]] in 2021 with [[Elizabeth Cameron]] appointed as Senior Director.

Under the [[Trump administration]], the [[NSC]]'s [[Principals Committee]] structure and attendance were notably altered, initially limiting regular attendance for the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (as per [[National Security Presidential Memorandum 2]]), but later reinstating their attendance and including the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] as a regular attendee (via [[National Security Presidential Memorandum 4]]), while also placing the [[Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development]] ([[USAID]]) as a permanent member of the [[Deputies Committee]].

The [[NSC]] exerted direct influence by ordering the [[United States military]] to halt a propaganda campaign in spring 2021 that spread disinformation about the [[Sinovac Chinese COVID-19 vaccine]], although the campaign continued until summer 2021.

One controversial task of the [[NSC]] is to identify individuals, including [[United States citizens]], deemed threats to national security and add them to a '[[kill list]]', a process that led to the killing of individuals like [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], with policies for targeted killing described by [[Homeland Security Advisor John O. Brennan]], who helped codify criteria through the [[Disposition Matrix database]].

The [[High Value Detainee Interrogation Group]] also reports directly to the [[NSC]].

The [[NSC]] is chaired by the [[President]] and includes statutory members like the [[Vice President]], [[Secretary of State]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Secretary of Defense]], and [[Secretary of Energy]], alongside non-statutory members such as the [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]], [[Attorney General]], and [[Secretary of Homeland Security]].

Key advisors to the [[NSC]] include the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (military advisor), the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (intelligence advisor), and the [[Director of National Drug Control Policy]] (drug control policy advisor), with others like the [[Chief of Staff to the President]] and [[White House counsel]] regularly invited.

The [[Principals Committee]], chaired by the [[National Security Advisor]], and the [[Deputies Committee]], chaired by the [[Deputy National Security Advisor]] or [[Deputy Homeland Security Advisor]], serve as senior interagency forums within the [[NSC]] structure, with the [[Deputies Committee]] establishing and directing [[Policy Coordination Committees]] ([[PCCs]]) for day-to-day interagency coordination.

[[President-elect Joe Biden]] announced that the newly created [[U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate]] would also be a member of the [[NSC]].
