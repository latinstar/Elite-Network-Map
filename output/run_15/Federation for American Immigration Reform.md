The [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR) is a nonprofit, anti-immigration organization that advocates for changes in U.S. immigration policy through position papers, events, and campaigns. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) classifies [[FAIR]] as a [[Hate Group]] with ties to [[White Supremacist Groups]]. [[John Tanton]], a [[White Nationalist]] and Michigan surgeon, founded [[FAIR]] in 1979, having previously been frustrated by the lack of interest from "liberal colleagues" in groups like [[Planned Parenthood]] and the [[Sierra Club]] regarding immigration restrictions. Other co-founders of [[FAIR]] include [[Otis Graham]], a professor, and [[Sydney Swensrud]], former chief executive officer of [[Gulf Oil]]. [[FAIR]]'s founder, [[John Tanton]], also established [[U.S. Inc]], a foundation that served as a funding conduit for [[FAIR]], [[Numbers USA]], and the [[Center for Immigration Studies]], receiving financial support from [[Cordelia Scaife May]]. Early leadership of [[FAIR]] included first executive director [[Roger Conner]], with [[Dan Stein]] becoming president in 1988. [[FAIR]] received significant funds from [[Cordelia Scaife May]] through her [[Laurel Foundation]] and $1.2 million from the [[Pioneer Fund]] in the 1980s and early 1990s. Following negative publicity, [[FAIR]] ceased publicly disclosed grants from the [[Pioneer Fund]], though the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] claimed [[FAIR]] continued to receive private support from Pioneer's leaders. [[FAIR]] helped its founder, [[John Tanton]], establish [[U.S. English]] to focus on projects concerning overpopulation, immigration, and the environment. Through the work of [[John Tanton]], founder of [[FAIR]], and Senator [[Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa]], [[U.S. English]] became a well-organized and funded movement. Historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] linked the rise of [[FAIR]] and [[U.S. English]] to a larger political phenomenon of [[Xenophobia]] in the 1980s. [[FAIR]] has engaged in direct political action, supporting [[California Proposition 187]] in 1994 and cooperating with [[Protect Arizona Now]] to support [[Proposition 200]] in 2004. In 2007, [[FAIR]] successfully campaigned against President [[George W. Bush]]'s proposed [[Immigration Reform]], rallying [[Talk Show Hosts]] and coordinating efforts with [[The Center for Immigration Studies]] and [[Numbers USA]]. During this period, [[FAIR]] was recognized as the "most important organization" fueling the backlash against immigration, with its founder [[John Tanton]] perceived as its leader. [[John Tanton]] communicated his concerns about a "Latin onslaught" and demographic shifts leading to a loss of political power for the "present majority" to [[FAIR]] colleagues in the [[WITAN memos]] in 1986. [[John Tanton]], founder of [[FAIR]], eventually resigned from [[U.S. English]] in 1988 following the leak of the [[WITAN memos]]. [[FAIR]] has created affiliated groups, including the [[Immigration Reform Law Institute]] (IRLI) and the [[FAIR Congressional Task Force]] (FCTF), and spun off [[The Center for Immigration Studies]] in 1985. Since 2007, [[FAIR]] has hosted the annual [[Hold Their Feet to the Fire]] event, where [[Lou Dobbs]] publicly commended the organization in 2008, and in 2009, 47 [[Conservative Radio Hosts]] joined the event for a "Capitol Hill lobbying push." [[Frank Sharry]], Director of [[America's Voice]], criticized [[FAIR]] for engaging in a "culture war" driven by [[Anti-Latino]] sentiment, to which [[Dan Stein]], president of [[FAIR]], accused [[America's Voice]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] of "unsubstantiated, invidious name-calling." [[Linda Chavez]], a former aide to President [[Ronald Reagan]], described [[John Tanton]], founder of [[FAIR]], as "the most influential unknown man in America." Despite this, [[Dan Stein]] publicly distanced [[FAIR]] from [[John Tanton]]'s controversial statements, asserting Tanton's lack of "significant control" for years. With an annual budget of $11.2 million by 2016, [[FAIR]]'s former executive director, [[Julie Kirchner]], was appointed ombudsman of [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman]] reporting to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in 2017, signifying a direct pathway of influence into government. A 2017 [[FAIR]] report on the costs of undocumented immigrants was criticized by the [[Associated Press]] for methodological flaws. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] further justified its classification of [[FAIR]] as a [[Hate Group]] by citing alleged [[Anti-Latino]] and [[Anti-Catholic]] attitudes, continued acceptance of funds from the [[Pioneer Fund]], hiring of individuals involved with [[White Supremacist Groups]], promotion of [[Racist Conspiracy Theories]], and the [[White Supremacist]] beliefs of [[John Tanton]], including a 1982 quote. In 2018, [[Joe Gomez]], a former press secretary for [[FAIR]], filed a complaint alleging racist, xenophobic, and ableist harassment at [[FAIR]], though [[Dan Stein]], president of [[FAIR]], later maintained the allegations were without foundation, referencing a "retraction" by Gomez.
