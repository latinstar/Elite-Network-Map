[[Konstantin Kilimnik]], a Russian-Ukrainian political consultant, is identified by the [[Mueller Report]] and [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] as connected to, or an officer of, [[Russian intelligence agencies]]. His background includes service as a linguist and translator in the [[Soviet Army]], working closely with the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)]] and later being known among Moscow political operatives as "[[Kostya, the guy from the GRU]]". [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] was reportedly dismissed from the [[International Republican Institute (IRI)]] due to suspected strong links to [[Russian intelligence services]], after previously working there for a decade. He became a central figure in investigations regarding [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and the [[2020 Trump presidential campaign]], being identified as "[[Person A]]" in court documents against [[Paul Manafort]] and [[Alex van der Zwaan]]. The [[United States intelligence community]] accused [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] of acting as a proxy for [[Russian intelligence]] by promoting misleading narratives about [[Joe Biden]] to U.S. media and officials close to [[Donald Trump]]. The [[US Treasury Department]] sanctioned [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] for providing [[Russian intelligence]] with sensitive [[Trump campaign]] polling and strategy information, which he received from [[Paul Manafort]], and for falsely claiming [[Ukraine]] interfered in the 2016 election. [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] was indicted by [[Special Counsel Robert Mueller]] for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice in connection with [[Paul Manafort]], leading to an [[FBI]] reward for his arrest. His professional connections include working for [[Paul Manafort]]'s consulting firm, running the [[Davis Manafort International]] office in [[Kyiv]], and advising former Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and his [[Party of Regions]] (and later the [[Opposition Bloc]]) on public relations strategies alongside [[Paul Manafort]] and others, including [[Rick Gates]] and [[Serhiy Lyovochkin]]. [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] and [[Paul Manafort]] actively assisted [[Ukrainian oligarchs]] and [[Russian oligarchs]] (such as [[Rinat Akhmetov]] and [[Oleg Deripaska]]) close to the [[Kremlin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] in efforts to shift [[Ukraine]]'s geopolitical alignment closer to [[Russia]]. He proposed the "[[Mariupol Plan]]", a peace effort involving [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s return as president over [[Russia]]'s illegally controlled regions in [[Ukraine]]. During the 2016 U.S. election, [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] routinely exchanged emails with [[Paul Manafort]] while the latter was [[Donald Trump]]'s campaign manager, requesting "private briefings" about the [[Trump campaign]] for [[Oleg Deripaska]]. He met with [[Paul Manafort]] and [[Rick Gates]] to receive internal polling data from [[Trump]]'s campaign, which [[Paul Manafort]] later asked him to pass to [[Oleg Deripaska]], [[Serhiy Lyovochkin]], and [[Rinat Akhmetov]]. [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] and [[Paul Manafort]] also discussed the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attack]] (attributed to [[Cozy Bear]] and [[Fancy Bear]]). The [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] determined that the sharing of intelligence with [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] by [[Paul Manafort]] and others constituted a "grave counterintelligence threat" and suggested [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] may have been involved in hacking [[Democrats]]' computers and passing information to [[WikiLeaks]]. [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] was involved in the [[Pericles Fund]], an unsuccessful business venture financed by [[Oleg Deripaska]], and attended [[Donald Trump]]'s inauguration, with tickets illegally purchased through [[Sam Patten]]. More recently, [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] supported the documentary film [[The Ukraine Hoax: Impeachment, Biden Cash, and Mass Murder]], which promoted conspiracy theories related to the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]], alongside figures like [[Andrii Derkach]] and [[Andrii Telizhenko]]. He currently lives in an elite gated community in [[Khimki]], near the [[Moscow unit of the GRU]] accused of the 2016 hacking. [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko]] was accused by the [[National Anti-Corruption Bureau]] and the [[United States Department of State]] of allowing [[Konstantin Kilimnik]] to flee [[Ukraine]] for [[Russia]] despite an ongoing investigation.
