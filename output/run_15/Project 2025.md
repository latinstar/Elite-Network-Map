Project 2025 (also known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project)[3] is a political initiative published in April 2023 by [[The Heritage Foundation|the Heritage Foundation]] think tank to reshape the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government of the United States]] and consolidate executive power in favor of [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] policies.[4] It constitutes a policy document that suggests specific changes to the federal government, a personnel database for recommending vetting loyal staff in the federal government, and a set of proposed [[Executive order|executive orders]] for the [[U.S. president]] to implement those policies.[5][6]
The project's policy document Mandate for Leadership[7] calls for the replacement of merit-based federal civil service workers by people loyal to "the next conservative president" and for taking partisan control of key government agencies, including the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] (DOC), and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).[8] Other agencies, including the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] (ED), would be dismantled.[9] It calls for reducing [[Environmental policy of the United States|environmental regulations]] to favor [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and proposes making the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) less independent while defunding its [[Embryonic stem cell|stem cell]] research.[10] The blueprint seeks to reduce taxes on corporations, institute a [[Flat income tax|flat income tax]] on individuals,[11] cut [[Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]],[12][13] and reverse as many of President [[Joe Biden]]'s policies as possible.[14][15] It proposes banning pornography,[16] removing legal protections against [[Anti-LGBT discrimination in the United States|anti-LGBT discrimination]],[17][18] and ending [[Diversity, equity, and inclusion|diversity, equity, and inclusion]] (DEI) programs[6][18] while having the DOJ prosecute [[Anti-white racism|anti-white racism]].[19] The project recommends the arrest, detention, and mass deportation of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]],[20][21] and deploying the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] for domestic law enforcement.[22] The plan also proposes enacting laws supported by the [[Christian right]],[23][24] such as criminalizing the sending and receiving of abortion and birth control medications[25][26][27] and eliminating coverage of emergency contraception.[12]
Project 2025 is based on a controversial interpretation of [[Unitary executive theory|unitary executive theory]] according to which the executive branch is under the president's complete control.[28][29] Analysts note that the approach would further reduce agency independence and centralize presidential control.
[[PBS News Hour]] reporting has linked these ambitions to discussions of domestic military involvement, pointing to Trump's deployment of the [[National Guard]] to Washington, D.C., as a potential precedent.[30][28] The project's proponents say it would dismantle a bureaucracy that is unaccountable and mostly [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]].[31] Critics have called it an [[Authoritarian|authoritarian]], [[Christian nationalism#United States|Christian nationalist]] plan[23][32][33] that would steer the U.S. toward [[Autocracy|autocracy]].[33] Some legal experts say it would undermine the [[Rule of law|rule of law]],[34] [[Separation of powers|separation of powers]],[6] [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]],[33][35] and [[Civil liberties|civil liberties]].[6][34][36]
Most of [[List of contributors to Project 2025|Project 2025's contributors]] worked in either [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump's first administration]] (2017−2021) or [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 presidential election]].[a] Several Trump campaign officials maintained contact with Project 2025, seeing its goals as aligned with their [[Agenda 47]] program.[31][42][43][44] Trump later attempted to distance himself from the plan.[b] After he won the 2024 election, he nominated several of the plan's architects and supporters to positions in [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|his second administration]].[52][53] Four days into his second term, analysis by [[Time]] found that nearly two-thirds of [[List of executive actions by Donald Trump|Trump's executive actions]] "mirror or partially mirror" proposals from Project 2025.[54]
The Heritage Foundation is closely aligned with Trump.[40] The project's president, Kevin Roberts, sees the organization's current role as "institutionalizing [[Trumpism]]".[58] At a 2022 Heritage Foundation dinner, Trump endorsed the organization, saying it was "going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ...
Vice President [[JD Vance]] wrote the foreword to Roberts's book Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America.[60] Some have claimed that Vance is connected to Project 2025 through shared views on policy matters.[61][62][63][64]
Project 2025 was established in 2022 with [[Paul Dans]] as director to provide the 2024 Republican presidential nominee with a personnel database and ideological framework.[65][43] According to the [[Johnson Amendment]], [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) organizations]] like Heritage cannot explicitly promote a particular election candidate.[66] The Heritage Foundation spent $22 million preparing staffing recommendations for a conservative government in 2025.
The [[Mandate for Leadership]] series has had new volumes released in parallel with [[United States presidential election|United States presidential elections]] since 1981.[70] Heritage calls its Mandate a "policy bible",[70] claiming that the implementation of almost two-thirds of the policies in its 1981 Mandate was attempted by [[Ronald Reagan]],[71] and similarly, the implementation of nearly two-thirds of the policies of its 2015 Mandate was attempted by Trump.[71][72]
In April 2023, the Heritage Foundation published the 920-page Mandate, written by hundreds of conservatives.[14] Nearly half of the project's collaborating organizations have received [[Dark money|dark money]] contributions from a network of fundraising groups linked to [[Leonard Leo]], a major conservative donor and key figure in guiding the selection of Trump's federal judicial nominees.[73]
Some of the authors worked for Amazon, Meta, and bitcoin companies directly or as lobbyists.[74] One expert claimed inconsistencies in the plan are designed for fund-raising from certain industries or donors that would benefit.[75]
The 2024 Trump campaign said no outside group speaks for Trump and that [[Agenda 47]] is the only official plan for a second Trump presidency.[76][77][78] Policy suggestions from groups in Project 2025 reflected Trump's own words.
His campaign said it appreciated these groups' policy suggestions.[79][71] On July 5, 2024, Trump denied any knowledge of Project 2025.[80] Political commentators including [[Robert Reich]], [[Michael Steele]], and [[Olivia Troye]] dismissed Trump's denial.[81][82][83]
Heritage briefed other [[2024 Republican Party presidential primaries| Republican]] candidates on the project, but focused on policies Trump could implement.[77]
Project 2025 is not the only conservative program with a database of prospective recruits for a potential Republican administration, though these initiatives' leaders all have connections to Trump.[84][42] In general, these initiatives seek to help Trump avoid the mistakes of his first term, when he arrived at the White House unprepared.[85] By reclassifying tens of thousands of merit-based federal civil service workers as [[Political appointments in the United States|political appointees]] in order to replace them with Trump loyalists,[8][40] some fear they would be willing to bend or break protocol, or in some cases violate laws, to achieve his goals.[31]
By February 2024, Project 2025 had over 100 partner organizations.[86] The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] identified seven of these as hate or extremist groups.[48]
In May 2024, [[Russell Vought]] was named policy director of the [[Republican National Committee]] platform committee.[87] The [[Russell Vought#Center for Renewing America|Center for Renewing America]] (CRA), founded by Vought, is on Project 2025's advisory board.[88] CRA drafted executive orders, regulations, and memos that could have laid the groundwork for rapid action on Trump's plans when he won.[89] The CRA identified Christian Nationalism as one of the top priorities for the second Trump term.[23] Vought claimed that Trump blessed the CRA, and that his effort to distance himself from Project 2025 was just politics.[89] Vought was Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget during his first term[23] and was reappointed to the position for the second term.[90]
In July 2024, [[Stephen Miller]], a former Trump advisor, sought to remove his organization, [[America First Legal]], from the Project 2025 list of advisory board members.[91] Before leaving Project 2025, he appeared in a promotional video for it.[92] In November 2024, he was appointed as an advisor to the White House for Trump's second term.[93][94]
[[John McEntee]], a senior advisor for Project 2025 and former Trump aide, said the project was doing valuable work in anticipation of Trump's second term.[98][99]
Before his second term, many Project 2025 contributors were expected to have positions in the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|second Trump administration]],[80] and the administration was expected to use the database of potential federal employees the project recruited and trained.[48] Peter Navarro, one of Mandate's authors, was appointed Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing.[102]
Project 2025 released a statement on July 5 saying the project "does not speak for any candidate or campaign" and that it is up to "the next conservative president" to decide which of its recommendations to implement.[72] In July 2024, Trump reiterated his disavowal of Project 2025,[105][106][107] but in the same month Project 2025 Director [[Paul Dans]] confirmed that his team had ongoing connections with Trump's campaign.[43] During the week of July 29, Dans told Project staff that he would step down as director in August to focus on the election campaign.[108][109] Kevin Roberts assumed leadership of the project.[110]
[[Roger Severino]] is vice president of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation.
The Mandate for Leadership outlines four main aims: restoring the family as the centerpiece of American life; dismantling the administrative state; defending the nation's sovereignty and borders; and securing God-given individual rights to live freely.[111] Roberts writes in the Mandate's foreword: "The long march of [[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory|cultural Marxism]] through our institutions has come to pass.
Roberts interprets the phrase "pursuit of happiness" in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as "pursuit of blessedness".
According to him, "an individual must be free to live as his Creator ordained—to flourish." The Constitution, he argues, "grants each of us the liberty to do not what we want, but what we ought".[100]: 13  He highlights family, religious devotion and spirituality, work, and community as contributing to "a good life".[100]: 13–14  Project 2025 plans to infuse every aspect of the federal government with [[Christian nationalism]].[23][113] Roberts writes that the U.S. in 2024 is a place where "inflation is ravaging family budgets, drug overdose deaths continue to escalate, and children suffer the toxic normalization of [[Transgender rights movement|transgenderism]] with [[Drag queen|drag queens]] and pornography invading their school libraries".[71] Roberts also expressed concern over crime in the U.S.[36]
Dans, also an editor of the project's guiding document, described Project 2025 as preparing a staff of conservatives to fight the [[Deep state in the United States|deep state]] with their training from partner organizations.[114][115] He wrote that Project 2025 has four pillars:[100]: xiv
Project 2025's supporters say it will dismantle a [[Government bureaucracy|government bureaucracy]] that is, they believe, unaccountable and biased toward [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].[31] Its critics have called it [[Authoritarian|authoritarian]], [[Christian nationalism#United States|Christian nationalist]],[23][32] and [[Autocracy|autocratic]].[33] Legal experts say it would undermine the [[Rule of law|rule of law]],[34] the [[Separation of powers|separation of powers]],[6] the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]],[35][33] and [[Civil liberties|civil liberties]].[6][34][36]
Some critics have suggested Project 2025 is based on personal vengeance, or that its proposals for national conservatism are merely an "attempt to intellectually retrofit a rationale for Trumpism".[31] Compared to previous Republican agendas, Project 2025 contains more elements of [[Culture war|culture war]] and advocates wider implementation of policy across the federal government.[116] Some Project 2025 proposals may require Congressional approval or favorable Supreme Court rulings, but many others appear designed for implementation through executive orders or regulatory action—a pattern noted in independent analyses of executive orders and regulatory initiatives aligned with the project.[31][117][118]
It is critical of the [[Federal Reserve]], which it blames for the [[Business cycle|business cycle]], and proposes its gradual abolition; it advocates instead that the dollar be backed by a commodity like [[Gold standard|gold]].[111] It recommends eliminating [[Full employment|full employment]] from the Federal Reserve's mandate, instead focusing solely on [[Inflation targeting|targeting inflation]].[100]: 740 [119]
The project envisions eventually moving from an income tax to a [[Consumption tax|consumption tax]], such as a national [[Sales tax|sales tax]].[120] In the interim, the project seeks to extend the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA).[121] It further recommends simplifying individual income taxes to two [[Flat tax|flat tax]] rates: 15% on incomes up to the [[Social Security Wage Base]] ($168,600 in 2024), and 30% above that.
An unspecified [[Standard deduction|standard deduction]] would be included, but most deductions, credits and exclusions would be eliminated.[120] The proposal would likely increase taxes significantly for millions of low- and middle-income households.[11]
It aims to reduce the [[Corporate tax in the United States|corporate tax]] rate from 21% to 18% because the mandate authors see it as the most harmful tax.
The 2017 TCJA cut the rate from 35% to 21%.[11] It proposes reducing [[Capital gains tax in the United States|the capital gains rate]] for high earners to 15% from the 2024 level of 20%.[11] After these reforms are implemented, it recommends that a three-fifths vote threshold be required to pass legislation that increases individual or corporate income tax.[100]: 698 [122] The constitutionality of such "legislative entrenchment" is debated, but most legal scholars agree it is not allowed.[123]: 28
The project proposes merging the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the [[Census Bureau]], and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] into a single organization, and aligning its mission with conservative principles.
It recommends maximizing the hiring of political appointees in statistical analysis positions.[120] It also recommends that Congress abolish the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].[124] It plans to abolish the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]], which is responsible for enforcing antitrust laws, and shrink the role of the [[National Labor Relations Board]], which protects employees' ability to organize and fight unfair labor practices.[75]
Project 2025 suggests abolishing the [[Economic Development Administration]] (EDA) at the [[Department of Commerce]], and, if that proves impossible, having the EDA instead assist "rural communities destroyed by the Biden administration's attack on [[Energy in the United States|domestic energy production]]".[100]: 683  Project 2025 also seeks to facilitate innovations in the [[Nuclear power in the United States|civilian nuclear industry]].[20]: 9 [125]
The project declares that "God ordained the [[Sabbath]] as a day of rest" and recommends legislation requiring that Americans be paid more for working on Sunday.[100]: 589  It also aims to institute work requirements for people reliant on the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]], which issues food stamps.[36] It recommends that the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] be more lenient on small businesses and that the overtime exception threshold be kept low enough not to burden businesses in rural areas.[126]
Project 2025 is split on the issue of foreign trade.[111] Mandate author [[Peter Navarro]] advocates what he calls a "fair trade" policy of reciprocal, higher [[Tariff|tariffs]] on the [[European Union]], China, and India, to achieve a [[United States balance of trade|balance of trade]], though not all U.S. levies are lower than those of its major trading partners.[127] On the other hand, Mandate author [[Kent Lassman]] of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] promotes a [[Free trade|free trade]] policy of lowering or eliminating tariffs to cut costs for consumers, and calls for more [[Free trade agreements of the United States|free trade agreements]].[127] He argues that Trump's and Biden's tariffs have undermined not just the American economy, but also the nation's international alliances.[121]
Regarding banking regulation, Mandate recommends combining the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], the [[National Credit Union Administration]], and parts of the Federal Reserve that perform regulatory and fiscal supervision.[100]: 705  The document says deposit insurance undermines bank depositors' incentive to monitor their banks' balance sheet.[100]: 743
A major concern of Project 2025 is what it calls "[[Woke|woke]] propaganda" in public schools.[111] In response, it envisions a significant reduction of the federal government's role in education, and the elevation of [[School choice|school choice]] and [[Parental rights movement|parental rights]].[9] To achieve that goal, it proposes closing the Department of Education, and giving states control over education funding and policy.[36] Programs under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) would be administered instead by the Department of Health and Human Services.
The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) would become part of the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]].[9]
Project 2025 further advocates that Title I of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] of 1965 be allowed to expire, removing $18 billion in federal funds for schools in low-income areas.[9] Public funds for education should be available as [[School voucher|school vouchers]] with no strings attached, even for parents sending their children to private or religious schools.[9] Cuts should be made to the funding for [[School meal programs in the United States|free school meals]].
The [[Head Start]] program that provides services to children of low-income families should be ended.
Roger Severino claimed the program does not provide value, but never provided evidence for his claims.[128] For the project's backers, education is a private rather than a [[Public good|public good]].[9] Project 2025 criticizes any programs to forgive [[Student loans in the United States|student loans]].[129]
Project 2025 encourages the president to ensure that "any research conducted with taxpayer dollars serves the national interest in a concrete way in line with conservative principles".[100]: 686  For example, research in [[Climatology|climatology]] should receive considerably less funding, in line with Project 2025's views on climate change.[130]
Project 2025 hopes to influence Congress to create legislation that would rescind the Biden administration's [[Title IX]] policies and restore the first Trump administration's Title IX regulations.
Mandate's climate section was written by several people, including [[Mandy Gunasekara]], whom Trump previously chose as the EPA's chief of staff, and [[Bernard McNamee]], whom Trump appointed to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].[132] Four of the report's top authors have publicly engaged in [[Climate change denial|climate change denial]].[133][14] McNamee dismisses [[Climate change mitigation|climate change mitigation]] as progressive policy.[14] Gunasekara acknowledges the reality of human-made climate change but considers it politicized and overstated.[134] She claimed to have been an instrumental advocate for the [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement]] in 2017.
The manifesto advises the president to go further than merely nullifying Biden's executive orders on climate change, to "eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere".[14][135] It proposes abandoning strategies for reducing [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] emissions responsible for [[Climate change|climate change]], including by repealing regulations that curb emissions, and abolishing the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), which the project calls "one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry".[133][136][132][137] One scientific expert said these policies would endanger lives, are [[Shooting the messenger|shooting the messenger]], and serve the [[Climate change denial|climate change denial]] movement.[49][138]
The [[Inflation Reduction Act]] increased the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office's loan budget from $40 billion to $400 billion.[139] Project 2025 supports repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and closing the Loan Programs Office.
Project 2025 advocates downsizing the EPA.[132][14] In particular, it seeks to close the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.[140][14][141] Heritage Foundation energy and climate director [[Diana Furchtgott-Roth]] has suggested that the EPA support the consumption of more [[Natural gas|natural gas]], despite climatologists' concern that this would increase leaks of [[Methane|methane]] (CH4), a [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] more potent than [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] (CO2) in the short term.[133] Project 2025 wants to reverse a 2009 EPA finding that [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] emissions are harmful to human health, preventing the federal government from regulating [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] emissions.[133][14] It also advocates preventing the EPA from using private health data to determine the effects of pollution.
Under its blueprint, the expansion of the national electrical grid would be blocked, the [[Energy transition|transition]] to [[Renewable energy|renewable energy]] stymied, and funding for the DOE's Grid Deployment Office curtailed.
The project further advocates that states be prevented from adopting stricter regulations on [[Vehicular emissions|vehicular emissions]], as the state of California has,[133] and that regulations on the [[Fossil fuel industry|fossil fuel industry]] be relaxed.[130] For example, restrictions on [[Oil drilling|oil drilling]] imposed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] could be removed.[132]
Project 2025's manifesto includes eliminating climate change mitigation from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]'s agenda and encouraging allied nations to use fossil fuels.[133] It declares that the federal government has an "obligation to develop vast oil and gas and coal resources" and supports [[Petroleum exploration in the Arctic|Arctic drilling]].[133]
Hunt[142] considered the Inflation Reduction Act crucial, and U.S. representative (now U.S. senator) [[John Curtis]] said it was vital that Republicans "engage in supporting good energy and climate policy".
[[American Conservation Coalition]] founder Benji Backer noted growing consensus among younger Republicans that human activity causes climate change, and called the project wrongheaded.[133]
The project abandons the [[Habitat conservation|habitat conservation]] goal of [[30 by 30]],[49] and advocates that the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] be replaced by private insurers.[143] The [[League of Conservation Voters]] has criticized this as a giveaway to private industry.[143]
Project 2025 seeks to place the federal government's entire executive branch under direct presidential control, eliminating the independence of the DOJ,[10] the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and other agencies.[5][65] The plan is based on a controversial interpretation of [[Unitary executive theory|unitary executive theory]], "an expansive interpretation of presidential power that aims to centralize greater control over the government in the White House."[144][38][145][146][111] Kevin Roberts said that all federal employees should answer to the president.[5] Since the Reagan administration, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has embraced a stronger unitary executive led by conservative justices, the [[Federalist Society]], and the Heritage Foundation, and overturned some precedents limiting Project 2025's vision of executive power.[28][29][147]
Project 2025 advocates for all [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] employees in leadership roles to be dismissed before January 20, 2025.[148] It explicitly recommends replacing these executive branch positions with ideologically vetted State Department leaders appointed to acting roles that do not require Senate confirmation.[149] [[Kiron Skinner]], who wrote the State Department chapter of Project 2025, ran the department's office of policy planning for less than a year during the Trump administration before being forced out of the department.
When asked by [[Peter Bergen]] in June 2024 if she could name a time when State Department employees obstructed Trump policy, she said she could not.[148][150]
In 2019, Trump said that [[Article Two of the U.S. Constitution]] grants him the "right to do whatever as president", a common claim among supporters of the unitary executive theory.
Similarly, in 2018, Trump claimed he could fire special counsel [[Robert Mueller]].[65] Trump is not the first president to consider policies related to the unitary executive theory.[151][152] The idea has seen a resurgence and popularization within the [[Republican Party]] since the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] in 2001.[153]
In 2023, [[Stephen Miller]] proposed immediately mobilizing the military at the start of second Trump administration for domestic law and immigration enforcement under the [[Insurrection Act of 1807]].[21] [[Jeffrey Clark]], a senior fellow at CRA and Project 2025 contributor, has investigated using the Insurrection Act for other purposes, including suppressing protests like the [[George Floyd protests]].[22] The Heritage Foundation denied Project 2025 planned to use the Insurrection Act, but Mandate has a single line that says it is possible to use the Insurrection Act to secure the southern border.[22][154] Russell Vought said the CRA was working to keep legal and defense communities from preventing use of the Insurrection Act.[155]
Clark also promoted making the Department of Justice less independent of the president in order to let Trump prosecute his political rivals.[156][157] For his alleged acts while working at the DOJ during the end of Trump's term, Clark has become a co-defendant in the [[Georgia election racketeering prosecution]] and an unnamed co-conspirator in the [[Federal prosecution of Trump for alleged election obstruction|federal prosecution of Trump for alleged election obstruction]].[22][158] According to reporting in outlets such as NBC News and NPR, Heritage officials have denied that Project 2025 includes plans to prosecute political opponents, framing such accusations as mischaracterizations of the initiative.[106][84][159]
Political experts have said Project 2025 represents significant [[Executive aggrandizement|executive aggrandizement]],[84][161] a type of [[Democratic backsliding|democratic backsliding]] involving government institutional changes made by elected executives that has been seen in Russia, Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela.[162][163] [[Cornell University]] political scientist Rachel Beatty Riedl says this global phenomenon represents threats to democratic rule not from violence but rather from using democratic institutions to consolidate executive power.
She has said, "if Project 2025 is implemented, what it means is a dramatic decrease in American citizens' ability to engage in public life based on the kind of principles of liberty, freedom and representation that are accorded in a democracy."[161] Phillip Wallach, a senior fellow studying separation of powers at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], characterized the project as visions that bleed into authoritarian fantasies.[6]
Ayer]], the deputy attorney general under [[George H.
Project 2025 proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees in order to replace them with Trump loyalists.[31] It established a personnel database shaped by the [[Ideology of Donald Trump|ideology of Donald Trump]].
Throughout his first term, Trump was accused of removing people he considered disloyal, regardless of their ideological conviction, such as former attorney general [[William Barr]].
In 2020, [[White House Presidential Personnel Office]] employees [[Executive Office appointments by Donald Trump|James Bacon]] and John McEntee developed a questionnaire to test potential government employees' commitment to Trumpism.
Bacon and McEntee joined Project 2025 in May 2023.[98] The project uses a similar questionnaire to screen potential recruits for adherence to its agenda.[2][164] For Trump's second term the project recommends that a [[White House Counsel]] be selected who is "deeply committed" to the president's "[[America First]]" agenda.[6][65]
In 2020, Trump established the [[Schedule F]] job classification by executive order.
In response to Schedule F's reinstatement, several unions sued and took other protective measures to prevent its full implementation.[167][168][90] At the end of Biden's term, about 4,000 government positions were deemed political appointments.[6][65] If fully implemented, Schedule F will affect tens of thousands of professional federal civil servants who have spent many years working under both Democratic and Republican administrations.[6][65] According to [[Georgetown University]] professor of public policy [[Donald Moynihan]], while apolitical and meritocratic selection of public servants is vital to administrative functioning, the Republican Party increasingly views them and [[Public-sector trade union|public sector unions]] as threats, or resources to be controlled.[169] Political scientist [[Francis Fukuyama]] has said that while the federal bureaucracy is in dire need of reform, Schedule F would "dangerously undermine" the government's functionality.[170]
By June 2024, the [[American Accountability Foundation]], a conservative [[Opposition research|opposition research]] organization led by former Senate aide Tom Jones, was researching certain key high-ranking federal civil servants' backgrounds.
Announcing the grant in May 2024, Heritage wrote that the research's purpose was "to alert Congress, a conservative administration, and the American people to the presence of anti-American bad actors burrowed into the administrative state and ensure appropriate action is taken." Some found Project Sovereignty 2025 reminiscent of [[McCarthyism]], when many Americans were persecuted and [[Blacklisted|blacklisted]] as alleged communists.[175][176][177]
[[Max Stier]] of the [[Partnership for Public Service]] voiced concern the project would revive the early-American [[Spoils-and-patronage system|spoils-and-patronage system]] that awarded government jobs to those loyal to a party or elected official rather than by merit.
The [[Pendleton Act of 1883]] mandated that federal jobs be awarded by merit.[178] Former Trump campaign and presidency senior advisor [[Steve Bannon]] has advocated for the plan on his [[War Room]] podcast, hosting Jeffrey Clark and others working on the project.[34]
He accuses the Biden administration of undermining the traditional [[Nuclear family|nuclear family]], and wants to reform the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promote this household structure.[12]
According to Project 2025, the federal government should promote the [[Medicare Advantage]] program, which consists of private insurance plans,[179] and federal healthcare providers should deny transgender people [[Transgender health care|gender-affirming care]].[12]
Project 2025 suggests a number of ways to cut funding for Medicaid, such as caps on federal funding, limits on lifetime benefits per capita, and letting state governments impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries of the program.[13][180] Other proposals include limiting state use of provider taxes, eliminating preexisting federal beneficiary protections and requirements, increasing eligibility determinations and asset test determinations to make it harder to enroll in, apply for, and renew Medicaid, providing an option to turn Medicaid into a voucher program, and eliminating federal oversight of state Medicaid programs.[13] The project also advocates cutting funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs ([[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]).[181]
Project 2025 aims to alter the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by making it easier to fire employees and to remove DEI programs.[73][113] Conservatives consider the NIH corrupt and politically biased.[182] Severino says the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] should not publish health advice, because it is inherently political.[179]
This Mandate for Leadership suggests abolishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and replacing it with an immigration agency that incorporates Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), and elements of the departments of Health and Human Services and DOJ.
[[Stephen Miller]], a key architect of immigration policy during the Trump presidency, is a major figure in Project 2025.[77] In November 2023, Miller told Project 2025 participant [[Charlie Kirk]] that the operation would rival the scale and complexity of "building the [[Panama Canal]]".
He said it would include deputizing the [[National Guard]] in [[Red states and blue states|red states]] as immigration enforcement officers under Trump's command.
In late 2023, Miller was reported to have considered deputizing local police and sheriffs for the undertaking, as well as agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].[21] These forces could then arrest illegal immigrants nationwide.
Detainees would then be held in [[Internment|internment camps]] near the border before deportation.
Trump has also spoken of rounding up homeless people in blue cities and detaining them in camps.[185] Funding for the [[Mexico–United States border wall]] would increase.[111]
Project 2025 encourages the president to withhold federal disaster relief funds granted by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) should state or local governments refuse to abide by federal immigration laws, by, for example, not sharing information with law enforcement.[183]
Project 2025 opposes what it calls "radical gender ideology"[129] and advocates that the government "maintain a biblically based, social-science-reinforced definition of marriage and family".[100]: 481  To achieve this, it proposes removing protections against discrimination on the basis of [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identity]], and eliminating provisions pertaining to [[Diversity, equity, and inclusion|diversity, equity, and inclusion]] (DEI)—which it calls "state-sanctioned racism"—from federal legislation.[17][18][186] Federal employees who have participated in DEI programs or any initiatives involving [[Critical race theory|critical race theory]] might be fired.[100]: 582, 583
Public school teachers who want to use a transgender student's [[Preferred gender pronoun|preferred pronouns]] would be required to obtain written permission from the student's [[Legal guardian|legal guardian]].[129] Project 2025's backers also want to target the private sector by reversing "the DEI revolution in labor policy" in favor of more "race-neutral" regulations.[186] Project 2025 is part of a trend of intensifying backlash against DEI in the early 2020s.[186]
Mandate promotes disbanding the White House's Gender Policy Council.[100]: 62  Government agencies would be forbidden from instituting quotas and collecting statistics on gender, race, or ethnicity.[186] Project contributor Jonathan Berry explains, "The goal here is to move toward [[Racial color blindness|colorblindness]] and to recognize that we need to have laws and policies that treat people like full human beings not reducible to categories, especially when it comes to race."[186] The U.S. Census Bureau would be reformed according to conservative principles.[71][113]
[[LGBTQ+]] writers and journalists have criticized Project 2025 for its proposals to remove protections for LGBTQ+ people and to outlaw pornography by claiming it is an "omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children".[17] Writing for Dame magazine, Brynn Tannehill argued that The Mandate for Leadership in part "makes eradicating LGBTQ people from public life its top priority", while citing passages from the playbook linking pornography to "transgender ideology", arguing that it is related to other anti-transgender attacks in 2023.[187]
Project 2025 proposes reconsidering the accommodations given to journalists who are members of the [[White House press corps|White House Press Corps]].[6] It proposes defunding the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], a private, nonprofit corporation that provides funding for the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] and [[National Public Radio]], as "good policy and good politics" because it accounts for "half a billion dollars squandered on leftist opinion each year".[100]: 246 [188]
It also entertains the idea of revoking NPR stations' noncommercial status, forcing them to move outside the 88–92 range on the FM dial, which could then be taken by religious programming.[189] [[Brendan Carr]], who wrote the article on the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in Project 2025,[100] was appointed by Trump to lead the FCC, and subsequently launched an investigation into NPR and PBS, in accordance with Project 2025.[190]
The Project also proposes allowing more media consolidation by changing FCC rules that would allow for the converting [[Local news|local news]] programs into national news programs.[189]
The project pushes for legislation requiring social media companies to not remove mainstream political positions from their platforms.[75] It also would prevent the [[Federal Election Commission|Federal Elections Commission]] from countering [[Misinformation|misinformation]] or [[Disinformation|disinformation]] about election integrity.[189] The nonprofit law institute [[Brennan Center for Justice]] wrote in an expert brief, "Project 2025 threatens to amplify attacks on election officials and throw the weight of the federal government behind those anti­democratic efforts."[191] The institute added that Project 2025 could imperil election officials by misusing the Department of Justice to target those whose actions do not align with the president's ideology.
In the view of Project 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has become "a bloated bureaucracy with a critical core of personnel who are infatuated with the perpetuation of a radical liberal agenda" and has "forfeited the trust" of the American people due to its role in the investigation of [[Mueller special counsel investigation|alleged Trump–Russia collusion]].
A DOJ reformed per Project 2025's recommendations would combat [[Reverse discrimination|affirmative discrimination]] or [[Anti-white racism|anti-white racism]], citing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].
comes at the expense of other Americans—and in nearly all cases violates longstanding federal law."[19] Therefore, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division would "prosecute all state and local governments, institutions of higher education, corporations, and any other private employers" with DEI or [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] programs.[180] Hamilton was also general counsel for America First Legal, a Project 2025 partner organization.[88]
Legal settlements called [[Consent decree|consent decrees]] between the DOJ and local police departments would be curtailed.[159] According to Project 2025, if the responsibilities of the FBI and another federal agency, such as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), overlapped, then the latter should take the lead, leaving the FBI to concentrate on (other) serious crimes and threats to national security.[159]
Louisiana]] that capital punishment for child rape violates the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].[195][192]
Like Trump, Project 2025 believes that the District of Columbia is infested with crime and, as such, suggests authorizing the [[United States Secret Service Uniformed Division|Uniformed Division]] of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to enforce the law outside of the White House and the immediate surroundings.[183]
[[Michael Bromwich]], who was [[Justice Department inspector general]] from 1994 to 1999, said:
It suggests mitigating these concerns through efforts such as banning [[TikTok]] and the [[Confucius Institute|Confucius Institutes]].[75][116][100]: 9–13  It accuses TikTok of espionage and the Confucius Institutes of corrupting American higher education.[75][116][100]: 9–13  The Project also expresses concern over [[Allegations of intellectual property theft by China|Chinese intellectual property theft]] and accuses [[Big Tech]] of acting on the behalf of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to undermine the U.S.[116][100]: 9–13  It encourages U.S. pension funds to avoid Chinese investments and recommends that U.S. companies seeking to invest in sensitive sectors in China face restrictions or denial of permission.[116]
On the campaign trail for his second term, Trump avoided giving specific foreign policy plans.[197] Project 2025 favors neither [[Interventionism|interventionism]] nor [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]], instead insisting that all decisions related to [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] prioritize national interests.[196] In Mandate, Max Primorac suggests significant changes to the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID)'s mission due to controversial issues such as the organization's promotion of abortion as healthcare, policies to mitigate climate change, acknowledgment of gender identities, and campaigns against systemic racism.
Mandate argues that the U.S. should maintain its [[Nuclear umbrella|nuclear umbrella]] only for nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), and that these countries should be responsible for deploying their own conventional forces to deter Russian aggression.[100]: 94–95  As of June 2024, 24 of the 32 NATO members had allocated at least 2% of their Gross Domestic Product ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]]) to defense.[198]
Christopher Miller advocates that the U.S. replace all its Cold War nuclear capabilities and infrastructure and develop the [[LGM-35 Sentinel]].
He also promotes testing more weapons in violation of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]].[101] The Biden administration also promoted the Sentinel's development.[199]
More specifically, Mandate calls for a speech shortly after inauguration to "make the case to the American people that nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantor of their freedom and prosperity", to be followed by additional funding for nuclear weapons modernization programs to develop and produce new warheads such as W87-1 Mod and W88 Alt 370 and deploy as-yet-unproven directed-energy and space-based weapons and a "cruise missile defense of the homeland".[100]: 127  The plan advocates continuing the [[B61-12]] and [[W80]] modernization programs, which began in 2013 and 2014 respectively and have been continued by each administration since.[200][199][100]: 127 [201] It also advocates restarting funding for nuclear armed [[Submarine-launched cruise missiles|submarine-launched cruise missiles]].[100]: 127  The Obama administration retired similar missile programs in 2010.
Plans include placing multiple warheads on each [[LGM-30 Minuteman#Minuteman III|Minuteman III]] ICBM and its [[LGM-35 Sentinel|Sentinel]] replacement by 2026, putting nuclear warheads on Army ground-launched missiles, adding nuclear capabilities to hypersonic missile systems, directing the Air Force to investigate a road-mobile ICBM launcher, expanding the pre-positioning of nuclear bombs and weapons in Europe and Asia, and directing the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA) to "transition to a wartime footing".
This would be funded by directing the NNSA to submit monthly briefings to the Oval Office and separate budget requests from the Energy Department, along with directing the [[Office of Management and Budget]] to submit a supplemental budget request to Congress.[95][101][154]
The [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] called Project 2025's nuclear policy "the most dramatic buildup of nuclear weapons since the start of the Reagan administration" and the beginning of a new global nuclear arms race.
It includes the prioritization of nuclear weapons development and production over other security programs, rejecting Congressional efforts to find cost-effective alternatives for the plans, increasing the number of nuclear weapons above treaty limits, rejecting current arms control treaties, expanding the NNSA's capability and funding, preparing to test new nuclear weapons despite the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and accelerating all missile defense programs.[95] Project 2025 would require the Defense Department to abolish its DEI programs and immediately reinstate all service members discharged for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19.[6] The [[United States Armed Forces]] would not be authorized to take climate change into account in evaluating national security threats.[130]
In the foreword of Project 2025's Mandate, Kevin Roberts argues that pornography promotes sexual deviance, the sexualization of children, and the exploitation of women; is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; and should be banned.[203] He recommends the [[Criminal prosecution|criminal prosecution]] of people and companies producing pornography, which he compares to addictive drugs.[17] Previously, the Supreme Court has ruled against attempts to ban pornography on First Amendment grounds.[203]
Roberts has said that although Trump has appeared in [[Playboy]] magazine and had [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal|an affair with a porn actor]], he could still be a powerful advocate against pornography because "our Lord works with imperfect instruments".[203][204] When the Republican Party nominated him for president in 2016, Trump signed a pledge to examine the "public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture".
Project 2025 recommends curtailing the [[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act|Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021]], which authorizes funding for de-carbonizing transportation infrastructure.[205] It views the [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA) unfavorably, calling it a waste of money.
Project 2025's proponents maintain that life begins at [[Fertilisation|conception]].[12] The Mandate says that the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) should "return to being known as the Department of Life", as Trump HHS secretary [[Alex Azar]] nicknamed it in January 2020, voicing his pride in being "part of the most pro-life administration in this country's history".
Jackson Women's Health Organization]] that, contrary to [[Roe v.
Severino told a [[Students for Life of America|Students for Life]] conference that Project 2025 was developing executive orders and proposing regulations to roll back Biden's abortion policies and solidify a new environment in the wake of Dobbs.[26] For example, the Reproductive Healthcare Access Task Force Biden created would be replaced by a dedicated pro-life agency that would advocate for health of unborn children and women with newfound authority.[25]
The project opposes any initiatives that in its view subsidize single parenthood.[23] It encourages the next administration to rescind some of the provisions of the [[Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970]], enacted as Title X of [[Public Health Service Act]], which offers reproductive healthcare services, and to require participating clinics to emphasize the importance of marriage to potential parents.[210]
Severino writes in the project's manifesto that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] should reverse its approval of the abortion pills [[Mifepristone|mifepristone]] and [[Misoprostol|misoprostol]] on ethical grounds.[100]: 458 [111] Project 2025 proposes eliminating insurance coverage of the [[Emergency contraception|morning-after pill]] [[Ulipristal acetate|Ella]], which insurance companies are required to cover under the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA).[12] Severino also recommends that the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] "update its public messaging about the unsurpassed effectiveness of modern [[Fertility awareness|fertility awareness]]-based methods" of contraception, such as smartphone applications that track a woman's [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycle]].[100]: 455 [210] He says that the HHS should require states to report the method and motivation of each abortion, the gestational age of the fetus, and the mother's state of residence.[100]: 455 [211]
The project seeks to restore Trump-era "religious and moral exemptions" to contraceptive requirements under the ACA, including [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraception]] (Plan B), which it deems an [[Abortifacient|abortifacient]],[212][12] to defund [[Planned Parenthood]],[23] and to remove protection of medical records involving abortions from criminal investigations if the records' owners cross state lines.[12] Project 2025 contributor Emma Waters told Politico, "I've been very concerned with just the emphasis on expanding more and more contraception." According to her, Project 2025's policy recommendations constitute not restrictions but rather "medical safeguards" for women.[210] Waters said she wanted the NIH to investigate [[Birth control#Effects|contraception's long-term effects]].[210]
In Project 2025's "Department of Justice" section, [[Gene Hamilton]] calls for enforcement of federal law against using the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] for transportation of medicines that induce abortion.[100]: 562 [213] Project 2025 seeks to revive provisions of the [[Comstock Act]] that banned mail delivery of any "instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing" that could be used for an abortion.
Congress and the courts have narrowed Comstock laws, allowing [[Birth control|contraceptives]] to be delivered by mail.[26][27]
The project proposes criminal prosecution of senders and receivers of [[Medical abortion|abortion pills]].[26][27] It does not explicitly advocate banning abortion,[111] but some legal experts and abortion rights advocates said adopting the Project's plan would cut off access to medical equipment used in surgical abortions to create a de facto national abortion ban.[214][215]
To prevent [[Teenage pregnancy in the United States|teenage pregnancy]], Project 2025 advises the federal government to deprecate what it considers promotion of abortion and high-risk sexual behaviors among adolescents.
It also seeks to remove HHS's role in shaping [[Sex education in the United States|sex education]], arguing that this is tantamount to creating a monopoly.[100]: 477 [179]
The database and modules were low-budget productions focused on ideology rather than practice.[97] [[ProPublica]] has published 23 of the videos Project 2025 created to support the training.
On September 24, 2024, Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts was due to release the book Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America, with a foreword by Republican vice-presidential nominee [[JD Vance]].[62][60] The book was initially subtitled Burning Down Washington to Save America.[62][60]
Roberts held book release events in Manhattan and Washington, D.C. On November 13, 2024, [[The Guardian]] published an account of the hostile reception its reporter encountered at one of the events.
[[Ruth Ben-Ghiat]], a scholar of [[Fascism|fascism]] and authoritarian leaders at [[New York University]], wrote in May 2024 that Project 2025 "is a plan for an authoritarian takeover of the United States that goes by a deceptively neutral name".
Doing away with the separation of church and state is the goal of many architects of Trumpism, from Project 2025 contributor Russ Vought to far-right proselytizer [[Michael Flynn]], who uses the idea of "[[Spiritual warfare|spiritual war]]" as counterrevolutionary fuel ...
Former [[Naval War College]] professor [[Tom Nichols]] wrote that Trump is serious about jailing opponents and curtailing the rights of American citizens.[229]
In [[Mother Jones]], Washington bureau chief [[David Corn]] called Project 2025 "the right-wing infrastructure that is publicly plotting to undermine the checks and balances of our constitutional order and concentrate unprecedented power in the presidency.
The Biden campaign launched a website critical of Project 2025 hours before his [[Joe Biden–Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate|June 27 debate with Trump]].[78][232] [[Kamala Harris]] continued the focus on Project 2025 when she became the Democratic presidential nominee.[74] Public awareness of Project 2025 rose after Biden's and Harris's campaigns brought attention to it and said it would be Trump's agenda.[74][233] The focus on opposition to Project 2025 increased during the transition from Biden to Harris as the nominee.[74] In August 2024, an oversize copy of The Mandate was used as a prop during the [[2024 Democratic National Convention]].[234][235][236]
Several conservatives and Republicans have criticized the plan for its stances on climate change and trade.[133][127] [[Ron DeSantis]] embraced Project 2025 in August 2023.[237]
After Trump won the [[2024 United States presidential election]], left-leaning media sources highlighted how right-wing commentators began saying on social media that Project 2025 was the official plan.
Former White House advisor [[Steve Bannon]] and Texas official Bo French supported transparency about implementing Project 2025.[238][239]
In April 2024, responding to criticism of the project, Heritage released a document titled "5 Reasons Leftists HATE Project 2025".[20] Restating many of its previously published objectives, the document said that "the radical Left hates families" and "wants to eliminate the family and replace it with the state"; that leftist "elites use the 'climate crisis' as a tool for scaring Americans into giving up their freedom"; that the "radical Left wants our country to travel down [the] same dark path" toward becoming the [[Soviet Union]], [[North Korea]], or [[Cuba]]; and that "woke propaganda" should be eliminated at every level of government.[20]
In July 2024, [[Oren Cass]], contributing author of Mandate's chapter on the Department of Labor, criticized the project's leadership: "Gaining productive power requires focusing on people's problems and explaining how you are going to solve them, not pounding the table for Christian nationalism or a second American revolution."[97] In April 2025, journalist David Graham published a book-length study, The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America.[240]
After Trump won the 2024 election, he nominated several Project 2025 contributors to positions in his second administration.[52] His choice to lead the FCC, [[Brendan Carr]], wrote the manifesto's chapter about the agency.[246] [[Tom Homan]], picked by Trump to act as a "[[Border czar|border czar]]", also contributed to the Project 2025 document.[247] Trump nominated [[Russell Vought]] to direct the [[Office of Management and Budget]].
After these selections, [[Karoline Leavitt]] issued a statement saying "President Trump never had anything to do with Project 2025";[248] Leavitt herself is an instructor for Project 2025's "Conservative Governance 101" training program[249] and was chosen by Trump as [[White House Press Secretary]].[250]
Other authors or contributors to Project 2025[100] who have been nominated or appointed to roles in the second Trump administration include [[Michael Anton]] (contributor, appointed Director of Policy Planning);[251] [[Paul S.
Atkins]] (contributor, nominated for Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission);[252] [[Steven G.
Bradbury]] (contributor, nominated for Deputy Secretary of Transportation);[253] [[Troy Edgar]] (contributor, nominated for Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security);[254] Jon Feere (contributor, appointed Chief of Staff at ICE);[255] [[Pete Hoekstra]] (contributor, nominated for ambassador to Canada);[256] Roman Jankowski (contributor, appointed Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer for the Department of Homeland Security); and Peter Navarro (author, appointed Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing).[102][257] Trump's nominations were confirmed faster than in his first term and faster than Biden's cabinet nominations.[258]
Aspects of the project implemented in the first days of Trump's second term include executive orders to reopen large areas of Alaska, including the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], to oil drilling,[259] and the withdrawal of a pending Biden administration ban on [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances|PFAS]] in industrial discharge.[260]
Metadata show that [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] memos sent to federal workers were written by Peter Noah and James Sherk, both associated with the Heritage Foundation.[261]
On February 7, 2025, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) announced that it would change its maximum indirect cost rate for university [[Research grant|research grants]] from 50% in some cases to 15%, as recommended by Project 2025.[263]
At the beginning of his second term, Trump signed [[Executive Order 14168]], [[Executive Order 14187]], and [[Executive Order 14183]], which revoked the federal government's recognition of transgender people.[268][269][270] In practice, this means the federal government will cease using gender in documents and favor sex.
The federal government also ceased to financially support [[Gender-affirming surgery|gender-affirming surgery]][268][271] and attempted to ban transgender people from the military.[270][272]
