The [[Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran]] acts as the primary conduit through which the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] issues orders to various [[military organizations]], [[cultural organizations]], [[economic organizations]], and [[political organizations]], indicating a pervasive influence across national sectors. Significant national decisions are influenced by [[political advisors]], [[military advisors]], and [[religious advisors]] who operate under the [[Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran]].
