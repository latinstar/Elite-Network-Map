The [[U.S. government]] exerted significant influence to stymie [[UN-led efforts to establish international norms for civilian-held firearms regulation]], successfully removing mentions of civilian ownership from the draft proposals for the [[2001 UN Programme of Action on Small Arms]], thereby obstructing international [[gun control]] initiatives. The [[Dickey Amendment]], a legislative provision first inserted into a federal spending bill in 1996, directly impacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] by prohibiting the use of federal funding to "advocate or promote [[gun control]]", which [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]] reported led to a 96% reduction in its gun violence research funding since 1996. In [[Canada]], [[Justin Trudeau]]'s [[Liberal government (Canada)]] demonstrated political leadership by enacting stringent [[gun control]] measures, including a ban on 1,500 kinds of military-style semi-automatic rifles via an [[Order In Council]] in 2020 and introducing [[Bill C-21]] in 2022 to freeze handgun sales and implement "[[red flag laws]]" and "[[yellow flag laws]]" to address gun violence. Similarly, in [[Australia]], former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] responded to the [[Port Arthur massacre]] by spearheading the creation of the comprehensive [[National Firearms Agreement (NFA)]] in 1996, showcasing a direct link between political will and the implementation of significant [[gun control]] policies. The debate around [[gun control]] in the [[United States]] is marked by deep ideological division, with [[gun rights activists]] emphasizing the [[Second Amendment]] as a basic right and [[gun control advocates]] strategically employing terms like "gun-violence prevention" or "common-sense regulation" to frame their objectives. The [[National Rifle Association of America (NRA)]] implicitly influences the perception and categorization of [[gun control]] laws by being used as a benchmark for restrictiveness, while the [[American Medical Association]] provides scientific support for stricter [[gun control]] through its research linking a higher number of firearm laws to reduced firearm fatalities.
