[[Vladimir Putin]] has held immense power in [[Russia]], serving multiple terms as [[President of Russia]] (2000-2008, 2012-present) and as [[Prime Minister of Russia]] (1999-2000, 2008-2012).
Prior to his political career, [[Vladimir Putin]] spent 16 years as a foreign intelligence officer in the [[KGB]], rising to lieutenant colonel and serving in [[Dresden, East Germany]], where he acted as a liaison to the [[Stasi]] and was reportedly involved in coordinating [[KGB]] support for the terrorist [[Red Army Faction]], a claim that a 2023 [[Der Spiegel]] investigation has disputed regarding its source's credibility.
[[Vladimir Putin]]'s early political career in [[Saint Petersburg]] was significantly shaped by his former law professor, [[Anatoly Sobchak]], whom he advised and whose influence contributed to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s career trajectory.
[[Vladimir Putin]] gained national prominence after moving to [[Moscow]] in 1996 to join [[President Boris Yeltsin]]'s administration, swiftly advancing to director of the [[Federal Security Service (FSB)]], where he focused on reorganizing and strengthening this key intelligence and security agency.
[[President Boris Yeltsin]] later endorsed [[Vladimir Putin]] as his preferred successor, leading to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s initial presidency and a subsequent consolidation of state power, including curbing the influence of [[oligarchs]] and establishing a [[vertical power structure]].
[[Vladimir Putin]]'s rule has transformed the [[Russian political system]] into an [[authoritarian dictatorship]], characterized by suppression of political opponents, censorship of independent media, and elections (like his 2024 re-election) widely deemed by international observers as neither free nor fair.
His foreign policy actions demonstrate a wide network of influence, as [[Vladimir Putin]] led [[Russia]] in conflicts against [[Chechen separatists]], oversaw the [[Russian invasion and occupation of Georgia]], directed a military intervention in [[Syria]] to support his ally [[Bashar al-Assad]], and initiated the full-scale invasion of [[Ukraine]] in 2022, resulting in international sanctions and an arrest warrant from the [[International Criminal Court]] for alleged war crimes.
In a move signaling a profound shift towards a [[war economy]], [[Vladimir Putin]] replaced [[Sergei Shoigu]] with [[Andrey Belousov]] as defense minister in May 2024, indicating preparations for prolonged conflict.
[[Vladimir Putin]] has engaged in nuclear threats against the [[West]], warning that [[Russia]] would consider nuclear retaliation if attacked with conventional weapons, a stance aimed at dissuading the [[United States]], [[UK]], and [[France]] from allowing [[Ukraine]] to use Western-supplied long-range missiles.
[[Vladimir Putin]] has rejected calls for an unconditional ceasefire and escalated attacks on [[Ukraine]], demanding territorial concessions in the [[Donbas]] and other terms that critics argue would dismantle [[Ukraine]] as a sovereign state, while dismissing the impact of [[United States]] sanctions against [[Rosneft]] and [[Lukoil]].
Ideologically, [[Vladimir Putin]]'s family has historical ties to Soviet power structures, with his grandfather [[Spiridon Putin]] serving as a personal cook to [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]; [[Vladimir Putin]] himself studied the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Lenin]], and was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)]] until its dissolution.
[[Vladimir Putin]]'s domestic policies have included establishing a [[vertical power structure]] by organizing federal subjects into administrative districts overseen by presidential envoys ([[Plenipotentiary Representative]]s) and replacing the direct election of governors with presidential nominations, actions aimed at consolidating central control and suppressing separatist tendencies.
