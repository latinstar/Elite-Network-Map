[[Harvey Weinstein]] co-founded [[Miramax]] and [[The Weinstein Company (TWC)]] with his brother [[Bob Weinstein]], establishing a powerful position in film production and distribution that garnered numerous [[Academy Award]]s and attracted collaborations with directors like [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]]. The sale of [[Miramax]] to [[Disney]] further cemented his Hollywood clout, while his aggressive business tactics included re-editing films by [[Mark Christopher]], [[Hayao Miyazaki]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Ole Bornedal]], drawing public criticism from figures such as [[Louis Malle]]. [[Harvey Weinstein]] also faced a lawsuit from [[Michael Moore]] concerning film profits and was accused of pressuring directors like [[Phillip Noyce]] (whose film release was delayed despite lobbying from star [[Michael Caine]]) and engaging in aggressive confrontations with [[Julie Taymor]] and her husband [[Elliot Goldenthal]], and allegedly hassling [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Anthony Minghella]]'s widow. Amid sexual abuse allegations, [[Harvey Weinstein]] orchestrated an extensive influence network to suppress information, hiring British-Israeli private intelligence firm [[Black Cube]] and other agencies like [[Kroll]] to track journalists [[Ronan Farrow]], [[Megan Twohey]], and [[Jodi Kantor]], as well as accusers such as [[Rose McGowan]], using false identities and psychological profiling. He sought to leverage his connections, unsuccessfully requesting aid from [[Woody Allen]] to stop [[Ronan Farrow]]'s reporting and directly approaching [[Hillary Clinton]] for intervention, leading [[Hillary Clinton]]'s publicist [[Nick Merrill]] to email [[Ronan Farrow]] in an attempt to halt publication. Furthermore, [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]] allegedly assisted [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s lawyer [[David Boies]] in attempting to bribe [[Rose McGowan]] for her silence. His public opposition to the extradition of [[Roman Polanski]] also demonstrated his reach, and the scandal eventually led to him being denounced by leading political figures he had previously supported, indicating his past role as an elite political donor.
