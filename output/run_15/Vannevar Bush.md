[[Vannevar Bush]] headed the [[U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)]] during [[World War II]], through which he directed nearly all wartime military R&D, including the initiation and early administration of the [[Manhattan Project]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] influenced national policy by emphasizing the importance of scientific research to [[national security]] and [[economic well-being]], ultimately being chiefly responsible for the movement leading to the creation of the [[National Science Foundation]] as outlined in his 1945 report, [[Science, The Endless Frontier]], to the [[President of the United States]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] exerted business influence by founding the company that became [[Raytheon]] in 1922, which grew into a major electronics company and [[defense contractor]], and also collaborated with [[Laurence K. Marshall]] and [[Richard S. Aldrich]] to create the [[Spencer Thermostat Company]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] held significant academic and research leadership roles as vice president of [[MIT]] and dean of the [[MIT School of Engineering]] in 1932, and later as president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW)]] from 1938, where he influenced research policy at the highest levels and informally advised the government on scientific matters. While at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW)]], [[Vannevar Bush]] exercised direct power to remove [[Harry H. Laughlin]], head of the [[Eugenics Record Office]], whom he considered a scientific fraud, and drastically cut funding for humanities, prioritizing "hard science." [[Vannevar Bush]] held strategic influence as chairman of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)]] (predecessor of [[NASA]]), lobbying the [[Senate Appropriations Committee]] for significant funding for new aeronautical research laboratories with support from military leaders like [[Major General Henry H. Arnold]] and [[Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] directly influenced the executive branch by proposing and securing [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s swift approval for the creation of the [[National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)]] in 1940, establishing himself as its chairman and de facto first [[presidential science advisor]] during [[World War II]]. As chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)]], [[Vannevar Bush]] appointed a network of leading scientists including [[Karl Taylor Compton]] (MIT), [[James B. Conant]] (Harvard), [[Frank B. Jewett]] (National Academy of Sciences, Bell Labs), and [[Richard C. Tolman]] (Caltech), and fostered a relationship with [[Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] facilitated crucial international strategic influence by arranging meetings between the [[NDRC]] and the [[Tizard Mission]], leading to the transfer of the advanced [[cavity magnetron]] technology and the subsequent creation of the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[MIT]]. [[Vannevar Bush]] was directly involved with intelligence operations, being approached by [[OP-20-G]] in 1935 and paid to design the [[Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM)]] to aid in codebreaking. [[Vannevar Bush]]'s intellectual and ideological influence extended to future generations through his engineering work on analog computers and the [[memex]], and his 1945 essay [[As We May Think]], which inspired computer scientists.
