[[Leonard Leo]] is a powerful conservative legal activist and co-chairman of the [[Federalist Society]]'s board of directors, who has cultivated an extensive network of influential conservative legal groups. This network, largely funded by anonymous donors, includes key funding hubs such as [[The 85 Fund]] and [[Concord Fund]] (formerly [[Judicial Crisis Network]]). [[Leo]] played a pivotal role in assisting [[Clarence Thomas]] during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings and spearheading campaigns supporting the nominations of Justices [[John Roberts]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]]. During the [[Donald Trump]] administration, [[Leo]] and the [[Federalist Society]] were instrumental in advising on federal judicial selections, which [[Trump]] publicly lauded as a significant achievement. [[Leo]] coordinated with then-Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] to block President [[Barack Obama]]'s nomination of [[Merrick Garland]] to the Supreme Court, with his [[Judicial Crisis Network]] spending over $7 million against [[Garland]]'s confirmation. Between 2014 and 2017, entities affiliated with [[Leo]] raised more than $250 million from prominent donors, including [[Charles Koch]] and [[Rebekah Mercer]]. [[Leo]] is the chairman of [[CRC Advisors]], a for-profit conservative political consulting firm, which received at least $43 million from his network's nonprofits between 2021 and 2022. He also leads the [[Teneo Network]], an initiative focused on combating "liberal dominance" in journalism, education, business, and politics. The [[Teneo Network]] serves on the advisory board for [[Project 2025]], a collection of policy proposals from the [[Heritage Foundation]] aimed at reshaping the federal government. His [[Marble Freedom Trust]] received a record $1.6 billion donation from [[Barre Seid]] in 2022 and plans to dedicate $1 billion to "crush liberal dominance" in news and entertainment and to combat "woke" corporations. [[Leo]] arranged for [[Liberty Consulting]], owned by [[Ginni Thomas]], to be paid $80,000 via [[The Polling Company]] (owned by [[Kellyanne Conway]]) and billed through the [[Judicial Education Project]], instructing [[Conway]] not to disclose [[Ginni Thomas]]'s involvement. [[Leo]] organized and attended a fishing trip with Justice [[Samuel Alito]] and businessman [[Paul Singer]], whose firms later had litigation before the Supreme Court. The Attorney General for the District of Columbia, [[Brian Schwalb]], initiated an investigation into [[Leo]]'s network of nonprofit groups for alleged nonprofit tax law violations. [[Leo]] has refused to cooperate with a subpoena from the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] concerning undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court justices, dismissing it as "politically motivated." His network subsequently launched a pressure campaign against [[Brian Schwalb]], drawing challenges from [[Republican attorneys general]] and a probe from [[Republican members of the U.S. House]]. [[Leo]] has served as national co-chairman of Catholic outreach for the [[Republican National Committee]] and as the Catholic strategist for the 2004 [[Bush presidential campaign]], having been appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] to the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]. He is a board member of the [[National Catholic Prayer Breakfast]], the [[Catholic Association]], [[Catholic Association Foundation]], [[Becket Law Fund]], [[Students for Life]], [[Napa Legal Institute]], [[Youth Leadership Foundation]], and the [[Board of Visitors at The Busch School of Business at Catholic University]]. [[Leo]] is also a member of the [[Council for National Policy]] and a knight of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. He lists [[BH Group]] as his employer, an entity that received over $4 million from his network's groups like [[Judicial Crisis Network]], [[Judicial Education Project]], and [[Wellspring Committee]] in its first two years. [[Leo]] also serves as president of the [[Freedom and Opportunity Fund]].
