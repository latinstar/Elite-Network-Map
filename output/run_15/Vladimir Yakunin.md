[[Vladimir Yakunin]] is a close confidant of [[Vladimir Putin]] and a former officer of the [[KGB]], establishing his deep ties within the Russian power structure.
He held significant influence as president of [[Russian Railways]] from 2005 to 2015 and achieved the high federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the [[Russian Federation]].
[[Vladimir Yakunin]] formalized his connections with an elite circle by co-founding the co-operative society [[Ozero]] with influential neighbors, including [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Andrei Fursenko]], [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Yuriy Kovalchuk]], [[Viktor Myachin]], [[Vladimir Smirnov]], and [[Nikolay Shamalov]].
Globally, [[Vladimir Yakunin]] served as Chairman of the [[International Union of Railways]] and promotes an ideological agenda as President and co-founder (with [[C. Kapur]] and [[N. Papanikolao]]) of the [[World Public Forum "Dialogue of Civilizations"]], which convenes the annual [[Rhodes Forum on Dialogue of Civilizations]].
His prominent role and alleged ties to the Russian government led to sanctions from the [[United States government]], specifically being placed on the [[Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)]] by the [[US State Department]], as well as similar measures by the [[Australian Government]] and the [[UK government]].
Allegations suggest [[Vladimir Yakunin]]'s dismissal from [[Russian Railways]] was linked to his son, [[Andrey Yakunin]], who operated the UK-based venture capital firm [[Venture Investments & Yield Management LLP]], indicating a complex interplay of family actions and political standing.
