The United States Senate is a chamber of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress]]; it is the [[Upper house|upper house]], and the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] is the [[Lower house|lower house]].
Together, the Senate and House have the authority under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] to make and pass or defeat federal legislation.
The Senate has exclusive power to confirm [[President of the United States|U.S. presidential]] appointments, to approve or reject treaties, and to convict or exonerate [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] cases brought by the House.
The Senate and the House provide a [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|check and balance]] on the powers of the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive]] and [[Federal judiciary of the United States|judicial]] branches of government.
The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the U.S. Constitution, which has been in effect since March 4, 1789.[2] Each of the [[U.S. state|50 states]] is represented by two senators who serve [[Classes of United States senators|staggered six-year terms]], for a total of 100 members.[3]
From its inception in 1789 until 1913, senators were appointed by the [[State legislature|state legislatures]] of their respective states.
Since 1913, however, following ratification of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] senators have been elected by statewide [[Direct election|popular vote]].[4]
The Senate has several powers of [[Advice and consent|advice and consent]].
These include the approval of [[Treaties|treaties]], the confirmation of [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet secretaries]], [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] (including [[List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justices of the Supreme Court]]), [[Flag officer#United States|flag officers]], regulatory officials, [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassadors]], [[United States federal executive departments|other federal executive officials]], and [[Uniformed services of the United States|federal uniformed officers]].
If no candidate receives a majority of [[Electoral College|electors]] for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|duty falls to the Senate]] to elect one of the top two recipients of electors to that office.
The Senate has been considered both a more deliberative[5] and prestigious[6][7][8] body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less [[Partisan|partisan]] atmosphere.[9]
The [[United States Senate chamber|Senate chamber]] is located in the north wing of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the nation's capital.
Despite not being a senator, the vice president of the United States serves as [[Ex officio|ex officio]] presiding officer and president of the Senate; the vice president may vote only if the Senate is equally divided.
In the vice president's absence, the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]], who is traditionally the most senior member of the Senate majority party, presides over the Senate, and more often by rule allows a junior senator to take the chair, guided by the [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate|parliamentarian]].
In the early 1920s, the practice of majority and minority parties electing their [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|floor leaders]] began.
A characteristic practice in the Senate is the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] on some matters and its remedy the [[Cloture|vote on cloture]].
The drafters of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] debated more about how to award representation in the Senate than about any other part of the Constitution.[10] While [[Bicameralism|bicameralism]] and the idea of a proportional[d] "people's house" were widely popular, discussions about Senate representation proved contentious.
In the end, some small states—unwilling to give up their equal power with larger states under the [[Articles of Confederation]]—threatened to secede[11] in 1787, and won the day by a vote of 5–4 in what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]].
First convened in 1789, the Senate of the United States was formed on the example of the ancient [[Roman Senate]].
The name is derived from the senatus, [[Latin]] for council of elders, derived from senex, meaning old man in Latin.[13] [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five of the Constitution]] stipulates that no constitutional amendment may be created to deprive a state of its [[Equal suffrage|equal suffrage]] in the Senate without that state's consent.
Before the adoption of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] in 1913, senators were elected by the individual [[State legislature|state legislatures]].[16] Problems with repeated vacant seats due to the inability of a legislature to elect senators, intrastate political struggles, bribery and intimidation gradually led to a growing movement to amend the Constitution to allow for the direct election of senators.[17]
In contrast to House of Representatives, the Senate has historically had stronger [[Social norm|norms]] of conduct for its members.[18]
The Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to "checks and balances" the powers of other elements of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].
However, the Constitution's [[Origination Clause]] provides that "All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives".[19] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes.
Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate [[Appropriation bill|appropriation bills]], or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds.[20][21][22][23] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House.
The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], in which [[Money bill|money bills]] approved by Parliament have originated in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] per [[Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom|constitutional convention]].[24]
As [[Woodrow Wilson]] wrote:
Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by sending amendments back and forth or by a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], which includes members of both bodies.
The president can make [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|certain appointments]] only with the [[Advice and consent|advice and consent]] of the Senate.
Officials whose appointments require the Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal executive agencies, [[Ambassador|ambassadors]], justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and other federal judges.
Typically, a nominee is the first subject to a hearing before a [[List of United States Senate committees|Senate committee]].
For instance, the Constitution provides that the president may make an appointment during a [[Recess|congressional recess]] without the Senate's advice and consent.
The [[Recess appointment|recess appointment]] remains valid only temporarily; the office becomes vacant again at the end of the next congressional session.
Congress has passed laws authorizing the president to conclude [[Executive agreement|executive agreements]] without action by the Senate.
Similarly, the president may make [[Congressional-executive agreement|congressional-executive agreements]] with the approval of a simple majority in each House of Congress, rather than a two-thirds majority in the Senate.
Neither executive agreements nor congressional-executive agreements are mentioned in the Constitution, leading some scholars such as [[Laurence Tribe]] and [[John Yoo]][31] to suggest that they unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty-ratification process.
The Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to [[Impeach|impeach]] federal officials for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors" and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments.
If the sitting president of the United States is being tried, the [[Chief justice of the United States|chief justice of the United States]] presides over the trial.
The House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted (one resigned before the Senate could complete the trial).[33] Only three presidents have been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2019 and 2021.
Under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], the Senate has the power to elect the vice president if no vice-presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the [[Electoral College]].
The Senate has only broken a deadlock once; in 1837, it elected [[Richard Mentor Johnson]].
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution]], sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election.[3] The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives.
In [[Federalist No. 62]], [[James Madison]] justified this arrangement by arguing that the "senatorial trust" called for a "greater extent of information and stability of character":
As a result, four senators who failed to meet the age requirement were nevertheless admitted to the Senate: [[Henry Clay]] (aged 29 in 1806), [[John Jordan Crittenden]] (aged 29 in 1817), [[Armistead Thomson Mason]] (aged 28 in 1816), and [[John Eaton]] (aged 28 in 1818).
On November 7, 1972, [[Joe Biden]] [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|was elected to the Senate]] at the age of 29, which was only 13 days prior to his 30th birthday on November 20, 1972.
The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] disqualifies as senators any federal or state officers who had taken the requisite oath to support the Constitution but who later engaged in rebellion or aided the enemies of the United States.
This provision, which came into force soon after the end of the Civil War, was intended to prevent those who had sided with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] from serving.
Originally, senators were selected by the [[State legislature|state legislatures]], not by [[Universal suffrage|popular elections]].
By the early years of the 20th century, the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums.[17] Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]].
Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, [[Election Day]], and occur simultaneously with elections for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].[37] Senators are elected by their state as a whole.
The [[Elections Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants each state (and Congress, if it so desires to implement a uniform law) the power to legislate a method by which senators are elected.
[[Ballot access]] rules for independent and minor party candidates also vary from state to state.
In 45 states, a [[Partisan primary|primary election]] is held first for the Republican and Democratic parties (and a select few [[Third party|third parties]], depending on the state) with the general election following a few months later.
In the general election, the winner is the candidate who receives a [[Plurality|plurality]] of the popular vote.
In [[Georgia]], a runoff between the top two candidates occurs if the plurality winner in the general election does not also win a majority.
In [[California]], [[Washington]], and [[Louisiana]], a [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|nonpartisan blanket primary]] (also known as a "jungle primary" or "top-two primary") is held in which all candidates participate in a single primary regardless of party affiliation and the top two candidates in terms of votes received at the primary election advance to the general election, where the winner is the candidate with the greater number of votes.
In Louisiana, the [[Louisiana primary|blanket primary is considered the general election]] and candidates receiving a majority of the votes is declared the winner, skipping a run-off.
In [[Maine]] and [[Alaska]], [[Instant-runoff voting|ranked-choice voting]] is used to nominate and elect candidates for federal offices, including the Senate.[38]
The [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] requires that vacancies in the Senate be filled by special election.
Whenever a senator must be appointed or elected, the [[Secretary of the Senate|secretary of the Senate]] mails one of three forms to the state's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new senator.[39] If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat, each seat is contested separately.
In ten states within the final category above – [[Arizona]], [[Hawaii]], [[Kentucky]],[41] [[Maryland]], [[Montana]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]] – the governor must appoint someone of the same political party as the previous incumbent.[40]: 9 [42]
In September 2009, Massachusetts changed its law to enable the governor to appoint a temporary replacement for the late senator [[Edward Kennedy]] until the special election in January 2010.[43][44]
This was achieved by dividing the senators of the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] into thirds (called [[Classes of United States senators|classes]]), where the terms of one-third expired after two years, the terms of another third expired after four, and the terms of the last third expired after six years.
[[Classes of United States senators#Class 2|Class II]] comprises senators whose six-year terms are set to expire on January 3, 2027.
There is no constitutional [[Term limits in the United States|limit to the number of terms]] a senator may serve.
The [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], however, changed the opening date for sessions to noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.
The Constitution requires that senators take an oath or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] to support the Constitution.[47] Congress has prescribed the following oath for all federal officials (except the President), including senators:
The annual [[Salaries of members of the United States Congress|salary]] of each senator, since 2009, is $174,000;[49] the president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400.[49][50] In 2003, at least 40 senators were millionaires;[51] by 2018, over 50 senators were millionaires, partly due to inflation.[52]
Along with earning salaries, senators receive retirement and health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully [[Vested|vested]] after five years of service.
Senators are covered by the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS) or [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS).
For example, minority leader [[Chuck Schumer]] is the senior senator from New York, having served in the senate since 1999, while [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] is New York's junior senator, having served since 2009.
Like members of the House of Representatives, senators use the prefix "[[The Honorable]]" before their names.[54][55] Senators are usually identified in the media and other sources by party and state; for example, [[Democratic Party|Democratic]] majority leader [[Chuck Schumer]], who represents New York, may be identified as "D–New York" or (D-NY).
Unless in the context of elections, they are rarely identified by which one of the [[Classes of United States senators|three classes of senators]] they are in.
The Senate may [[List of United States senators expelled or censured|expel]] a senator by a two-thirds vote.
Fifteen senators have been expelled in the Senate's history: [[William Blount]], for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Secession|secession]].
Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many [[Resignation from the United States Senate|senators have chosen to resign]] when faced with expulsion proceedings – for example, [[Bob Packwood]] in 1995.
The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; [[Censure in the United States|censure]] requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office.
Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as [[Robert Torricelli]] in 2002.
The "majority party" is the [[Political party|political party]] that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation determines which party is the majority party.
Independents and members of third parties (so long as they do not [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|caucus]] support either of the larger parties) are not considered in determining which is the majority party.
One hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a [[Semicircular|semicircular]] pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle.
The [[Democratic Party]] traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the [[Republican Party]] traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats.[56]
Forty-eight of the desks date back to 1819, when the Senate chamber was reconstructed after the original contents were destroyed in the 1812 [[Burning of Washington]].
Under the Constitution, the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] serves as president of the Senate.
They may vote in the Senate ([[Ex officio|ex officio]], for they are not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but are not required to.[59] For much of the nation's history the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president's principal duties (the other being to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates "in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives", so that the total votes could be counted).
The Constitution authorizes the Senate to elect a [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] ([[Latin]] for "president for a time"), who presides over the chamber in the vice president's absence and is, by custom, the senator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service.[60] Like the vice president, the president pro tempore does not normally preside over the Senate, but typically delegates the responsibility of presiding to a majority-party senator who presides over the Senate, usually in blocks of one hour on a rotating basis.
It is said that, "in practice they are usually mere mouthpieces for [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate|the Senate's parliamentarian]], who whispers what they should do".[61]
The [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|presiding officer]] sits in a chair in the front of the Senate chamber.
The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]].
The presiding officer calls on senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first senator who rises is recognized); ruling on [[Points of order|points of order]] (objections by senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.
Each party elects [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate party leaders]].
Each party elects an [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|assistant leader (whip)]], who works to ensure that his party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.
The Senate's chief administrative officer is the [[Secretary of the Senate|secretary of the Senate]], who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks.
Another official is the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|sergeant at arms]] who, as the Senate's chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the Senate premises.
The [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] handle routine police work, with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight.
Other employees include the [[Chaplain of the United States Senate|chaplain]], who is elected by the Senate, and [[United States Senate Page|pages]], who are appointed.
The Senate uses [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|Standing Rules]] for operation.
Like the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a [[Dais|dais]] from which the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|presiding officer]] presides.
Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by [[C-SPAN 2]].
The Senate commonly waives some of its stricter rules by [[Unanimous consent|unanimous consent]].
The presiding officer sometimes uses the [[Gavel|gavel]] of the Senate to maintain order.
A "[[Senate hold|hold]]" is placed when the leader's office is notified that a senator intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the Senate to consider or pass a measure.
The Constitution provides that a majority of the Senate constitutes a [[Quorum|quorum]] to do business.
Under the rules and customs of the Senate, a quorum is always assumed as present unless a [[Quorum call|quorum call]] explicitly demonstrates otherwise.
Journalist [[George Packer]] has argued that the Senate's arcane rules have rendered it obsolete and ineffective.[62]
The [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|rules of the Senate]] provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day.
A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, it does not necessarily coincide with the [[Calendar day|calendar day]].
The [[Filibuster|filibuster]] is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely.
The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking [[Cloture|cloture]].
Historically, cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required [[Supermajority|supermajority]], so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster.
The longest filibuster speech in the Senate's history was delivered by [[Strom Thurmond]] (D-SC), who [[Strom Thurmond filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957|spoke for over 24 hours]] in an unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]].
The longest individual speech (though not technically a filibuster as there was no bill being blocked) in the Senate's history was delivered by [[Cory Booker]] (D-NJ) in 2025.
Under certain circumstances, the [[Congressional Budget Act of 1974]] provides for a process called "[[Reconciliation|reconciliation]]" by which Congress can pass bills related to the budget without those bills being subject to a filibuster.
The [[Senate filibuster]] is frequently debated as the Constitution specifies a simple majority threshold to pass legislation, and some critics feel the de facto three-fifths threshold for general legislation prevents beneficial laws from passing.
Steven Wirls argues that the filibuster, elevated in importance in 1917, was prominently and persistently wielded in defense of white supremacy.[10][dubious – discuss] The [[Nuclear option|nuclear option]] was exercised by both major parties in the 2010s to weaken the filibuster for confirmations.
A majority of those voting determines whether the motion carries.[73] If the vote is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a [[United States Vice Presidents' tie-breaking votes|tie-breaking vote]].
Some news media have confused the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster with the 51 votes needed to approve a bill with for example [[USA Today]] erroneously stating "The vote was 58–39 in favor of the provision establishing concealed carry permit reciprocity in the 48 states that have concealed weapons laws.
Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] trials.
Most committee work is performed by 16 standing committees, each of which has jurisdiction over a field such as [[Finance|finance]] or [[International relations|foreign relations]].
(For instance, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] considers nominees for judgeships, and the [[Foreign Relations Committee]] considers nominees for positions in the [[Department of State]].) Committees may block nominees and impede bills from reaching the floor of the Senate.
Standing committees also oversee the departments and [[Government agency#United States|agencies]] of the executive branch.
In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to [[Subpoena|subpoena]] witnesses and evidence.
Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even [[Dementia|senility]].[78] Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed.
They are the [[Russell Senate Office Building]], the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]], and the [[Hart Senate Office Building]].
Political scientist [[Robert Dahl]] wrote of the Senate, "the degree of unequal representation in the U.S. Senate is by far the most extreme [and a] profound violation of the democratic idea of political equality among citizens."[81] The countermajoritarianism is rooted in two features.
In 1790, Virginia had 10 times the population of Rhode Island, while California had 70 times the population of Wyoming in 2020.[83] U.S. citizens in the [[District of Columbia statehood movement|District of Columbia]] and in [[U.S. territories]] have never been represented in the Senate.[84][85] One analysis of democracies by Harvard professors Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky found that only Argentina and Brazil's upper chambers deviate further from the [[One person, one vote|one person, one vote]] principle than the U.S. Senate does.[86] This disparity in representation between large and small states has increasingly favored Republicans since the 1960s,[87][88][89] with [[David Wasserman]] estimating in 2018 that Democrats would need to keep winning the popular vote by more than 6% to maintain control of the Senate.[90] Elizabeth Rusch and Daniel Lazare argue that the Senate's structure gives voters from small states disproportionate influence and allows them to benefit from disproportionate amounts of federal funding when compared to voters from larger states.[83][91] Ian Millhiser argues that the points made in favor of the status quo do not hold up since some states vote the same as large states, and that the current system was just a political compromise to unite 13 sovereign nations after the Revolutionary War.
[[James Madison]] emphasized that the Senate serves as a check against the potential tyranny of the majority, ensuring that the interests of smaller states are not drowned out by the more populous ones.
This was despite Madison being initially opposed to equal suffrage before coming around to support it.[94] In [[Federalist No. 62]] Madison writes about this tradeoff:
Connelly Jr., in his book James Madison Rules America: The Constitutional Origins of Congressional Partisanship, argues that this structure "provides stability and continuity, balancing the rapidly changing political winds of the House of Representatives".[95] Yale legal scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]], in his book America's Constitution: A Biography, explains that the Senate's structure is integral to the federal system, ensuring that smaller states have a voice in the democratic process.[96] Stanford political theorist Bruce E.
Since filibuster rules were revised in 1975, the Democratic Party earned filibuster-proof supermajorities three times after the [[1974 United States Senate elections|1974]], [[1976 United States Senate elections|1976]] and [[2008 United States Senate elections|2008]] Senate elections.
Equal representation for smaller states was pivotal for the legislative accomplishments of the Clinton presidency, like the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], and the Obama presidency, like the [[Affordable Care Act]], at a time when Democrats earned more seats in lower population states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Nebraska, and Iowa.[98]
These include [[Australia]], where the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] allocates twelve senators to each of the six original states (and two to each territory) and [[Switzerland]], where each canton receives two seats (and each half-canton receives one seat) in the [[Council of States]] (Ständerat), regardless of population size.[99]
In [[South Africa]], a [[Unitary state|unitary state]], each of the nine provinces is accorded an equal delegation of ten representatives, irrespective of population size, in the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the upper house of Parliament).[100]
The following are published by the [[Senate Historical Office]].
