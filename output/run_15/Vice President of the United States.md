The [[Vice President of the United States]] (VPOTUS) is a powerful figure, serving as the second-highest ranking officer in the [[U.S. federal government]]'s [[executive branch]] and ranking first in the [[presidential line of succession]]. The [[VPOTUS]] holds strategic influence as a statutory member of both the [[United States Cabinet]] and the [[United States National Security Council]] ([[NSC]]), granting direct involvement in executive government and national security matters. Historically, the role of the [[Vice President]] has expanded from being an "insignificant office" to an integral part of the [[president's administration]], often serving as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the [[President of the United States]]. Early in its history, figures like [[Thomas Jefferson]] used the [[Vice Presidency]] to frustrate the policies of the [[President]], highlighting the potential for ideological conflict within the executive. The power of the [[Vice President]] was significantly boosted by [[Harry Truman]] who, after being uninformed as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Vice President regarding critical matters like the [[Manhattan Project]], ensured future [[Vice Presidents]] would be members of the [[NSC]], attend [[Cabinet]] meetings, and receive security briefings, profoundly increasing their strategic insight and influence. The [[Vice President]]'s executive authority further expanded under [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who authorized [[Richard Nixon]] to preside at [[Cabinet]] meetings and assume temporary control of the [[executive branch]] during presidential incapacitation, thus making the [[VPOTUS]] visible on the world stage. Later, [[Jimmy Carter]] intentionally elevated the influence of the [[Vice President]] by giving [[Walter Mondale]] an office in the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]], directly integrating the [[VPOTUS]] into presidential decision-making processes. In the 21st century, [[Dick Cheney]] exemplified disproportionate influence, frequently making policy decisions independently, sometimes without the direct knowledge of [[George W. Bush]], leading to calls by analysts like [[Matthew Yglesias]] and [[Bruce Ackerman]] for the abolition of the office due to its accumulated power. Despite the growing executive role, the [[Vice President]] maintains a crucial [[legislative branch]] function as [[President of the Senate]], empowered to cast a [[tie-breaking vote]], a power notably exercised by [[Kamala Harris]] who holds the record for such votes. The selection of the [[Vice President]] as a [[running mate]] by the [[Presidential candidate]] has also become a critical political dynamic, with modern figures like [[JD Vance]] assuming the office through this process.
