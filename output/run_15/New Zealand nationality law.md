The primary law governing [[Nationality|nationality]] of [[New Zealand]] is the Citizenship Act 1977, which [[Coming into force|came into force]] on 1 January 1978.
Regulations apply to the entire [[Realm of New Zealand]], which includes the country of New Zealand itself, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], [[Tokelau]], and the [[Ross Dependency]].
Individuals born in the realm from that year on receive New Zealand citizenship at birth if at least one of their parents is a New Zealand citizen or otherwise entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely (meaning New Zealand and Australian permanent residents, as well as [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizens]]).
Foreign nationals may be granted citizenship if they are [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent residents]] and live in any part of the realm.
New Zealand was previously a [[Colony of New Zealand|colony of the British Empire]] and local residents were [[British subject|British subjects]].
Over time, the colony was granted more autonomy and [[Independence of New Zealand|gradually became an independent sovereign state]].
Although New Zealand citizens are no longer British, they remain [[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth citizens]] under British law.
When residing in the [[United Kingdom]], New Zealanders are eligible to vote in [[Elections in the United Kingdom|UK elections]] and serve in public office there.
Although [[Citizenship|citizenship]] and [[Nationality|nationality]] have distinct legal meanings,[4] New Zealand nationals have been referred to as citizens in domestic nationality legislation since 1948.[5] Nationality refers to a person's legal belonging to a country and is the common term used in international treaties when referring to members of a state, while citizenship usually refers to the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation.
This distinction is generally clearly defined in non-English-speaking countries but not in the [[Anglosphere]].[6] In the New Zealand context, there is little distinction between the two terms and they are used interchangeably.[7]
New Zealand became a part of the [[British Empire]] in 1840 after the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].[8] Accordingly, [[British nationality law]] applied to the colony.
All New Zealanders were [[British subject|British subjects]], including the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]], who were extended all rights as British subjects under the terms of the treaty.[9]
Any person born in New Zealand, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], or anywhere else within [[The Crown|Crown]] dominions was a natural-born British subject.[10] [[Foreign national|Foreign nationals]] who were not British subjects had limited property rights and could not own land.
French and German immigrants successfully lobbied the government for the ability to [[Naturalization|naturalise]] in 1844.
Individuals intending to become British subjects needed to request for their names to be included in annual naturalisation ordinances or Acts passed by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor]] or [[New Zealand Parliament|General Assembly]] that regularly granted foreigners subject status.[9]
British nationality law during this time was uncodified and did not have a standard set of regulations,[11] relying instead on past [[Precedent|precedent]] and [[Common law|common law]].[12] Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether rules for naturalisation in the United Kingdom were applicable elsewhere in the British Empire.
Each colony had wide discretion in developing their own procedures and requirements for naturalisation up to that point.[13] In 1847, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] formalised a clear distinction between subjects who naturalised in the UK and those who did so in other territories.
Those naturalising in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalisation and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory;[14] a subject who locally naturalised in New Zealand was a British subject there, but not in [[England]] or [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]].
Individuals living in or intending to reside in New Zealand who met a good character requirement and were able to pay a £1 fee could apply for naturalisation with the [[Department of Internal Affairs|Colonial Secretary's Office]].[9] There was no minimum residence requirement and applicants simply needed approval from the governor.[16] British subjects who had already been naturalised in the United Kingdom or other parts of the empire (except for its colonies in Asia) could apply to be naturalised again in New Zealand without swearing an [[Oath of Allegiance|oath of allegiance]] if they had previously taken one; they already would have owed allegiance to the Sovereign.[17] Foreign women who married British subjects were considered to have automatically naturalised under the new regulations.[18] New Zealand was the first self-governing nation to grant the [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|right to vote to women]];[19] British subject women participated in their first [[1893 New Zealand general election|elections in 1893]].[20]
Rising tensions over land sale disputes and settler incursions into Māori land led to a series of armed conflicts and mass land confiscations in the 1860s, as well as legislative efforts to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate the Māori]] into colonial legal systems.[21] Ambiguous wording in the Treaty of Waitangi raised uncertainty as to whether they were actually granted subjecthood or merely the rights of that status; the Native Rights Act 1865 was enacted to affirm their British subject status[9] and clarify the colonial judiciary's legal authority over them.[22] [[Voting in New Zealand|Franchise qualification]] was dependent on an individual owning land, but Māori land was customarily held in [[Communal land|communal title]] rather than by [[Freehold|freehold title]] under a single person's ownership.[23] [[Māori electorates]] in the General Assembly were created in 1867 as a temporary measure while Māori land was gradually converted into titles recognisable in colonial law, and this special representation was later made permanent in 1876.[24] Male subjects of partial Māori descent were assigned to an electorate based on their ancestry; those who were more than half-Māori were assigned to the Māori electoral roll, and those who had more non-Māori lineage were assigned to the general roll.
Chinese immigration to New Zealand began in the 1860s during the [[West Coast gold rush]].[26] Growing hostility and anti-Chinese sentiment along with the rise of colonial nationalism led to a concerted movement within the legislature to restrict Chinese immigration.
At least 20 bills written to curb Chinese migration were introduced in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 1879 to 1920.
The first of these to pass was the Chinese Immigrants Act 1881,[27] which limited the number of Chinese migrants who could land in New Zealand to one per ten tons of cargo and imposed a £10 [[New Zealand head tax|head tax]] on every Chinese person who entered the colony.
These restrictions were tightened to one migrant per 100 tons in 1888,[28] then to one per 200 tons in 1896.[29] [[Qing dynasty|China]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]], and the islands of modern [[Indonesia]] were declared to be "infected places" under the Public Health Act 1876; ships originating from or stopping in one of these territories, or those that allowed any person or cargo coming from or passing through those areas were subject to strict quarantine on their arrival in New Zealand.[30] The head tax was increased to £100 in 1896, and would not be abolished until 1944.[28] Chinese residents were completely prohibited from naturalising as British subjects from 1908 to 1952.[31]
The [[Cook Islands]], [[Tokelau]], and [[Niue]] respectively became [[British protectorate|British protectorates]] in 1888, 1889, and 1901.
[[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]] was a [[German Samoa|German territory]] from 1900 until the [[World War I|First World War]].
After the war, it became a [[League of Nations mandate]] under New Zealand control.[33] Following the recommendation of the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]],[34] Western Samoans did not automatically become British subjects when New Zealand assumed mandatory authority in 1920 but were treated as [[British protected person|British protected persons]] instead.[35] Although Parliament amended nationality law in 1923 and 1928 to allow facilitated naturalisation to Western Samoans wanting to become British subjects,[33] virtually none had taken this option.
[[Dominion|Dominions]] that adopted this Act as part of local legislation were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalisation.[37] New Zealand adopted most of this law (Parts I and III) in 1923, except for its provisions on imperial naturalisation (Part II), which it later enacted in 1928.[38]
The 1914 regulations codified the doctrine of [[Coverture|coverture]] into imperial nationality law, where a woman's consent to marry a foreigner was also assumed to be intent to [[Denaturalization|denaturalise]]; British women who married foreign men automatically lost their British nationality.
Britain formally recognised this at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], jointly issuing the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]].
Full legislative independence was granted to the Dominions with passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].[40]
Diverging developments in Dominion nationality laws, as well as growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the empire, culminated with the [[Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946|creation of Canadian citizenship in 1946]], unilaterally breaking the system of a common imperial nationality.
Combined with the approaching independence of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947, comprehensive nationality law reform was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.[44] The Dominion governments agreed on the principle of equal standing for women in a reformed nationality system at the [[1946 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] and New Zealand amended its law to grant equal nationality rights in that same year.[45]
New Zealand enacted the [[British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948]] to create its own citizenship, which came into force at the same time as the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] throughout the empire.[46] All British subjects who were born, naturalised, or resident for at least 12 months in New Zealand automatically acquired New Zealand citizenship on 1 January 1949.
[[Commonwealth citizen]] is defined in this Act to have the same meaning.[48] British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country.[49] Irish citizens were treated as if they were British subjects, despite [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s exit from the Commonwealth in 1949.[50] All Commonwealth and Irish citizens were eligible to become New Zealand citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in New Zealand for at least three years.[51] Commonwealth and Irish women who were married to New Zealand citizens were eligible to acquire citizenship by registration with no further requirements.[52] Foreign wives and minor children of male New Zealand citizens were allowed to register as citizens[47] at the discretion of the [[Minister of Internal Affairs]].[53] All other foreign nationals could acquire citizenship by naturalisation after at least five years of residence.[54]
All British subjects under the reformed system initially held an automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[55] Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration.[56] In response, the British Parliament imposed immigration controls on any subjects originating from outside the UK and Ireland with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]].[57] Ireland had continued to allow all British subjects free movement despite independence in 1922 as part of the [[Common Travel Area]] arrangement, but moved to mirror Britain's restriction in 1962 by limiting this ability only to people born on the islands of [[Great Britain]] or Ireland.[58] Britain somewhat relaxed these measures in 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom,[57] which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens.[59]
As a sign of New Zealand's changing relationship with Britain, [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand passports]] were no longer labelled with the phrase "British passport" beginning in 1964[60] and stopped listing national status as "British subject and New Zealand citizen" in 1974.[61] Voting rights were extended to all individuals permanently resident in the country for at least one year in 1975.
Foreign nationals becoming New Zealand citizens are no longer naturalised, but receive "citizenship by grant".[65] Commonwealth and Irish citizens remain technically defined in New Zealand law as non-foreign, but there are no benefits provided to either group.[66] The UK itself updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and possessions with the [[British Nationality Act 1981]],[64] which redefined British subject to no longer also mean Commonwealth citizen.
Applicants who successfully apply for citizenship are required to take an [[Oath of Allegiance|oath or affirmation of citizenship]] pledging their loyalty to the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|New Zealand monarch]], who is the same person as the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]].
Subsequent New Zealand legislation after Samoan independence caused a significant number of Samoans already living in New Zealand to become [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].[33] In 1982, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] ruled that all Western Samoans born between 1924 and 1948 were British subjects and automatically became New Zealand citizens in 1949.
Faced with the prospect of a potential [[Brain drain|brain drain]] if large numbers of its people exercised their newfound dual citizenship rights, Western Samoa signed the Protocol to the Treaty of Friendship with New Zealand on 21 August 1982.
This treaty, and the subsequent Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982, effectively nullified the Privy Council ruling.[75] This Act affirmed citizenship for Samoans who were already present in New Zealand before 15 September 1982, but required that those who enter the country after that date must first become permanent residents before acquiring citizenship.[76] Since passage of the [[Citizenship (Western Samoa) (Restoration) Amendment Act 2024]], Samoans born in that territory between 1924 and 1948 and who remain domiciled there are eligible to apply for New Zealand citizenship.[77]
The Cook Islands became a self-governing state in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand in 1965, and Niue gained independence under largely the same terms in 1974.
Nationality regulations apply to the entire [[Realm of New Zealand]], which includes New Zealand itself, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the Ross Dependency.[8] New Zealand airspace, its internal and territorial waters, and New Zealand-registered ships and aircraft are treated as part of the realm for nationality purposes.[78]
Foreigners over the age of 16 may become New Zealand citizens by grant after residing in the realm for more than five years while possessing indefinite permission to remain.[73] This usually means holding [[New Zealand permanent residency]], but [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizens]] and [[Australian permanent resident|permanent residents]] also have an indefinite permission to remain.[82] Permanent residents of the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau meet this requirement as well.[83] Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English language and be physically present in the country for at least 1,350 days during that five-year period and at least 240 days in each of those five years.[73] Under exceptional circumstances, the physical presence requirement may be reduced to 450 days in a 20-month period.[84] Candidates who are overseas on [[Crown servant|Crown service]] or accompanying New Zealand citizen spouses overseas on Crown service are treated as if they are present in New Zealand during that period of service.[85] Successful applicants aged 14 and older[86] are required to take an [[Oath of Citizenship|oath or affirmation of citizenship]] in which they pledge loyalty to the New Zealand monarch;[87] these are usually administered by [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|local councils]] at citizenship ceremonies that take place three to five months after approval.[86]
Otherwise, they may apply for their children born overseas to receive citizenship by grant, at the discretion of the Minister of Internal Affairs.[88] An average of 28,000 people per year were granted citizenship through the 2010s.[89] As of the [[2023 New Zealand census|2023 census]], about 1.4 million New Zealand citizens usually resident in the country were born overseas.[90]
[[Samoan nationality law|Samoan citizens]] who enter New Zealand after 14 September 1982 and have indefinite permission to remain in the country are entitled to become New Zealand citizens by grant without a minimum residence requirement.
Citizenship may be involuntarily deprived from individuals who fraudulently acquired it, or from those who possess another nationality and willfully acted against the [[National interest|national interest]].[93]
