The [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) serves as the principal security agency of [[Russia]] and is the main successor to the [[Soviet Union's KGB]], having evolved from the [[Federal Counterintelligence Service]] (FSK).
The director of the [[FSB]] is appointed by and directly answerable to the [[President of Russia]], holding significant, if not decisive, power within the executive branch.
[[Boris Yeltsin]] formally established the [[FSB]] from the [[FSK]] in 1995 and appointed [[Vladimir Putin]], a former [[KGB]] veteran, as its director in 1998, with [[Putin]] later appointing [[Nikolai Patrushev]] as head of the [[FSB]] in 1999.
[[Vladimir Putin]], as [[President of Russia]], brought the [[FSB]] under his direct control in 2000 and expanded its responsibilities in 2003 by integrating the [[Border Guard Service]] and major functions of the [[Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information]] (FAPSI), thereby strengthening his own power base.
The [[FSB]]'s influence was further extended under [[President Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2010, granting its officers expanded powers for counterterrorism, including issuing warnings and making arrests, which drew criticism from [[human rights organizations]].
The [[FSB]] plays a lead role in [[Russia]]'s "intelligence and influence operations" abroad, particularly concerning [[Ukraine]] since 2014, with its [[Fifth Service]] (Department for Operational Information) focusing on former [[Soviet Union]] territories and specifically targeting [[Ukraine]] through its [[Ninth Directorate of the Fifth Service]].
[[Alexander Bortnikov]], the current director of the [[FSB]], played a key role in persuading [[Vladimir Putin]] to invade [[Ukraine]], alongside [[Nikolai Patrushev]] and [[Yury Kovalchuk]], who are among [[Putin]]'s closest associates.
The [[FSB]] reportedly misled [[Vladimir Putin]] regarding the anticipated reception of Russian forces in [[Ukraine]] in both 2014 (for [[Crimea]]) and 2022, according to a [[Russian military analyst]] and [[Radio Free Europe]].
The [[FSB]] has faced accusations from [[Ukrainian counterintelligence]] of operational failures, insubordination, and sabotage during the 2022 invasion of [[Ukraine]], including tapped communications and alleged leaks of intelligence to [[Ukrainian intelligence]], detailing the location of [[Chechen commandos]] sent to assassinate [[Zelensky]].
[[Vladimir Putin]] reportedly blamed the [[FSB]] and its [[Fifth Service]] for military setbacks in [[Ukraine]], leading to reports of [[Sergey Beseda]], head of the [[Fifth Service]], and his deputy [[Anatoly Bolyukh]] being placed under house arrest, a report deemed "credible" by a [[U.S. official]].
Reports from [[Bellingcat executive director Christo Grozev]] suggest [[Sergey Beseda]] was transferred to [[Lefortovo Prison]], and over 100 [[FSB agents]] from the [[Fifth Service]] were sacked, with [[Grigory Grishaev]] reportedly now heading the service.
The [[FSB]] is described by current and former officials as rife with corruption and bureaucratic bloat, with a [[Ukrainian intelligence official]] asserting the [[FSB]] recruited pro-Russian collaborators who provided [[Vladimir Putin]] and the [[FSB director]] with desired, rather than accurate, intelligence.
Internally, the [[FSB]] conducts counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counterterrorism, and investigations into serious crimes within [[Russia]], organized into specific departments like the [[Economic Security Department]] and [[Department for Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism]].
The [[FSB]] has a history of combating terrorism, including transferring overall command of federal forces in [[Chechnya]] to the agency in 2001 and employing [[FSB Spetsnaz units]] ([[Alpha Group]] and [[Vympel]]) in high-profile hostage rescue operations like the [[Moscow theater siege]] and [[Beslan school siege]], despite criticisms regarding casualties.
The [[FSB]] claimed to have killed [[Shamil Basayev]], responsible for the [[Beslan tragedy]], and has eliminated all presidents of the separatist [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] (including [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiev]], [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and [[Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev]]) through its operations.
In 2024, the [[FSB]] arrested [[Ksenia Karelina]], a Russian-American ballet dancer, and charged her with treason for donating to [[Razom]], a [[New York City]]-based non-profit aiding [[Ukraine]], accusing her of supporting the [[Kyiv regime]].
The [[FSB]] introduced a "counter-terrorism" operational regime in Russian regions bordering [[Ukraine]] (e.g., [[Kursk]], [[Bryansk]], [[Belgorod Oblasts]]) in August 2024, restricting movement and enhancing security.
The [[FSB]] actively conducts counter-espionage, having exposed numerous foreign spies, including an engineer at [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] who sold information to the [[American CIA]], and has prosecuted scientists (e.g., [[Igor Sutyagin]], [[Valentin Danilov]], [[Alexander Kuranov]]) for espionage involving sensitive technologies like hypersonic development.
A leaked internal [[FSB]] memo in 2025 reportedly raised concerns about [[China]] engaging in industrial espionage targeting sensitive Russian technologies.
A major reshuffle in the [[FSB]] in 2006, affecting [[FSB Deputy Directors]] like [[Yury Zaostrovtsev]] and [[Vladimir Anisimov]], was linked to the [[Three Whales Corruption Scandal]] and widely interpreted as an attempt to undermine [[Nikolay Patrushev]]'s influence within the agency.
[[Yuri Sapunov]], head of counterterrorism at the [[FSB]], publicly outlined the criteria for designating organizations as terrorist by the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]].
