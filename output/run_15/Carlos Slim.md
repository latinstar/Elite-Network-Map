[[Carlos Slim]] derives his fortune from extensive holdings in numerous Mexican companies through his conglomerate, [[Grupo Carso]], which accounts for 40% of listings on the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]]. The core of [[Carlos Slim]]'s wealth stems from telecommunications, where he owns [[América Móvil]], the Mexican carrier [[Telcel]], and [[Telmex]], a state-run company acquired from the [[Mexican government]] during privatization in the early 1990s, which maintained a virtual monopoly for many years. [[Carlos Slim]] acted in concert with [[France Télécom]] and [[Southwestern Bell Corporation]] to purchase [[Telmex]] from the [[Mexican government]], a move that later led to [[Telmex]] controlling 90% of Mexico's telephone lines and [[Telcel]] operating almost 80% of the country's cellphones. In a significant expansion of media influence, [[Carlos Slim]] became the largest single shareholder of non-voting Class A shares in the [[New York Times Company]] by 2015. [[Carlos Slim]], along with [[Larry King]], established [[Ora TV]], an on-demand digital television network that produces shows like *Politicking with Larry King* and *Jesse Ventura Uncensored*, indicating a direct involvement in shaping public discourse. Through his telecommunications company [[América Móvil]], [[Carlos Slim]] acquired broadcast rights for the [[Olympic Games]] in Latin America and for Mexican soccer teams [[Pachuca]] and [[León]], competing with established Mexican television companies [[Televisa]] and [[TV Azteca]]. [[Carlos Slim]] founded [[Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en América Latina SAB de CV (IDEAL)]], a not-for-profit infrastructure development company, and established [[Carso Infraestructura y Construcción, S. A. (CICSA)]] as a non-profit construction and engineering firm within [[Grupo Carso]], both of which have secured infrastructure contracts in Mexico. In Europe, [[Carlos Slim]] took control of [[Telekom Austria]], Austria's largest telecommunications company, through a syndicate holding structure combining his 27% ownership with the Austrian state holding company [[OIAG]]'s 28%, aiming for expansion into central and eastern Europe. [[Carlos Slim]]'s investment company, [[Inmobiliaria Carso]], has acquired stakes in troubled Spanish entities like the bank [[Bankia]] and the real estate company [[Realia]], where he is a significant shareholder behind [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas]], in which he also holds a minor stake. [[Carlos Slim]]'s private equity fund, [[Sinca Inbursa]], focuses investments primarily on the transportation and infrastructure sectors. A news story surfaced in 2024 referencing *Why Nations Fail* and stating that [[Carlos Slim]]'s fortune was amassed by forming a telecommunications monopoly thanks to his close relationship with the [[Mexican government]] rather than through innovation, highlighting a critical perspective on his network of influence. Furthermore, [[Carlos Slim]] has continued his international telecommunications expansion by acquiring a stake in the British telecommunications company [[BT]].
