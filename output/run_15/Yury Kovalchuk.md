[[Yury Kovalchuk]] is a Russian billionaire financier and businessman, widely reputed to be [[Vladimir Putin]]'s personal banker and considered "Number 2 in today's Russia" by journalist [[Mikhail Zygar]]. He shares an ideology with [[Vladimir Putin]] focused on restoring [[Russian greatness]], reportedly influencing [[Putin]]'s decision to invade [[Ukraine]] in 2022. [[Kovalchuk]] demonstrates significant political influence, having co-founded the cooperative society [[Ozero]] with [[Vladimir Putin]] and other key figures like [[Vladimir Yakunin]], [[Andrei Fursenko]], [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Viktor Myachin]], [[Vladimir Smirnov]], and [[Nikolay Shamalov]], sharing properties in Solovyovka. His deep personal connection to [[Putin]] is further evidenced by hosting the wedding of [[Putin]]'s daughter [[Katerina Tikhonova]] to [[Kirill Shamalov]] and by being a close advisor and "cashier" to [[President Putin]], according to the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]. [[Kovalchuk]] holds substantial financial power, having transferred at least $1 billion to an offshore entity according to the [[Panama Papers]] and serving as chair and largest shareholder of [[Rossiya Bank]]. Through [[Rossiya Bank]] ownership with [[Nikolay Shamalov]], [[Kovalchuk]] became a primary investor in the development of annexed [[Crimea]], where he also purchased the [[Novy Svet vineyard]] following its annexation by [[Russia]]. His media empire includes [[National Media Group]] ([[NMG]]), which formed [[Media Alliance]] with [[US Discovery Channel]] and partnered with [[Netflix]] for a Russian streaming service, and through which he acquired [[Ted Turner]]'s Russian media assets like [[CNN (Russian version)]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boomerang]]. [[Kovalchuk]] also owns shares in influential Russian TV channels, including [[Channel One Russia]], and partly owns [[Sogaz]], which acquired a stake in [[VK]] from [[Alisher Usmanov]]'s [[USM]]. His control extends to private assets associated with the state, as [[Alexei Navalny]] alleges [[Kovalchuk]] owns [[Vladimir Putin]]'s residence at [[Valdai]], which [[Kovalchuk]] leases to the [[Russian government]]. Due to his connections and actions, [[Kovalchuk]] was sanctioned by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[UK government]] in relation to the annexation of [[Crimea]] and the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]]. His brother, [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]], is the scientific secretary of the [[Council for Science and High Technologies]] attached to the [[President of the Russian Federation]], highlighting a familial link to the state apparatus.
