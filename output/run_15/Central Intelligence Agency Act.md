The [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] (also known as the 'CIA Act of 1949' or 'Public Law 110'), enacted in 1949 by the [[United States Congress]], established significant powers and exemptions for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. This legislation granted the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] the authority to operate with confidential fiscal and administrative procedures, exempting it from many standard limitations on federal funds, thereby creating a hidden financial and operational framework. A key provision of the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] (Section 7) directly influences the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s structure and personnel transparency by exempting it from disclosing its organization, functions, officials, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed, thus facilitating a veiled network of operations. Furthermore, the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] created the 'PL-110' program, demonstrating its influence over non-standard immigration procedures for defectors and 'essential aliens' by providing them with cover stories and economic support outside normal channels. The constitutionality of the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] was challenged in the 1972 [[Supreme Court]] case, [[United States v. Richardson]], on the grounds that its secrecy provisions conflicted with the transparency requirements of Article I, Section 9 of the [[United States Constitution]], highlighting a foundational power dynamic between governmental secrecy and public accountability. However, the [[Supreme Court]] decision in [[United States v. Richardson]] ultimately reinforced the practical effect of the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]]'s secrecy by finding that [[Richardson]], as a taxpayer, lacked standing to argue the case, thereby protecting the Act's broad exemptions.
