The [[Federalist Society]] (also known as [[FedSoc]]) is an influential American conservative and libertarian legal organization that advocates for a textualist and originalist interpretation of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Its logo features [[James Madison]], reflecting the organization's intellectual lineage from the co-writer of The Federalist Papers. Founded in 1982 by students from [[Yale Law School]], [[Harvard Law School]], and the [[University of Chicago Law School]], the [[Federalist Society]] sought to challenge liberal ideology in law schools and now plays a central role in networking and mentoring young conservative lawyers. The [[Federalist Society]]'s significant influence is demonstrated by its vetting of [[President Donald Trump]]'s potential [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominees, with 43 out of 51 of his appellate court nominees in March 2020 being current or former members. At least five current [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justices—[[Brett Kavanaugh]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]]—are current or former members of the [[Federalist Society]], while [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] previously served on its Washington, D.C., chapter steering committee. [[Amanda Hollis-Brusky]] described the [[Federalist Society]] as having "evolved into the de facto gatekeeper for right-of-center lawyers aspiring to government jobs and federal judgeships under Republican presidents." [[Steven Teles]] highlights the [[Federalist Society]]'s role in a "supply-and-demand relationship" where judges require scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles, demonstrating its impact beyond judicial selection. The administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]] considered membership in the [[Federalist Society]] a "proxy for adherence to conservative ideology" when nominating conservative judges. Early funding for the [[Federalist Society]]'s initial conference came from the [[Institute for Educational Affairs]], followed by significant funding from the [[John M. Olin Foundation]]. Prominent donors to the [[Federalist Society]] have included the [[Scaife Foundation]], the [[Bradley Foundation]], [[Koch family foundations]], [[Google]], [[Chevron]], [[Charles G. and David H. Koch]], the family foundation of [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], and the [[Mercer family]]. The [[Federalist Society]] is a client of the public relations firm [[Creative Response Concepts]], indicating a strategic approach to its public image and messaging. [[Leonard Leo]], former executive vice president of the [[Federalist Society]], "endorses the network theory of the society," emphasizing its role in building a self-perpetuating legal community. The [[Federalist Society]] serves as a "talent network and placement agency," providing a proving ground for members to hone arguments and gain the attention of mentors higher in the political-legal hierarchy. The [[Federalist Society]]'s [[Regulatory Transparency Project]] ([[RTP]]) works through twelve working groups to analyze government regulations, issuing white papers and holding events to foster conversation on regulatory costs. Members of the [[Federalist Society]] have been instrumental in significant legal shifts, including advocating for an individual right view of the [[Second Amendment]], which was influential in the [[District of Columbia v. Heller]] ruling. The [[Federalist Society]] had a significant influence on the [[Citizens United Supreme Court ruling]], which weakened campaign finance regulations. The ideas espoused by the [[Federalist Society]] were "at the intellectual heart" of [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]], the case challenging the [[Affordable Care Act]] ([[ACA]]). [[Randy Barnett]], a leading voice in the libertarian wing of the [[Federalist Society]], was an architect of constitutional claims against the [[ACA]], with his involvement initiated at a [[Federalist Society]] national convention. Legal positions within the [[George W. Bush administration]] were overwhelmingly staffed with [[Federalist Society]] members, with approximately half of his appellate court nominees being members. Conservative critics of [[Harriet Miers]]'s Supreme Court nomination cited her lack of [[Federalist Society]] "credentials" as a reason for their opposition, leading to her withdrawal and the subsequent nomination of [[Samuel Alito]], an active [[Federalist Society]] member. Members of the [[Federalist Society]] encouraged the [[George W. Bush administration]] to end the practice of giving the [[American Bar Association]] ([[ABA]]) confidential early access to judicial nominees for vetting. The [[Federalist Society]]'s influence extends to advocating for conservative stances on abortion rights and social issues, with many members favoring the overturning of [[Roe v. Wade]] prior to its 2022 reversal. Members of the [[Federalist Society]] argue against courts considering race in decisions and were extensively involved in the [[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]] ruling. The [[Federalist Society]] provides its 70,000 members with "intellectual sparring and professional grooming," and its official journal is the [[Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy]]. A proposed advisory opinion by the [[Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States]] aimed to bar judges from membership in the [[Federalist Society]], while still allowing membership in the [[American Bar Association]].
