[[Breakout Ventures]] was founded in 2016, emerging from [[Breakout Labs]], a program originally established under the [[Thiel Foundation]]. The [[Thiel Foundation]] itself was created by [[Peter Thiel]], an influential figure known for his role as an elite political donor and prominent venture capitalist, thereby positioning [[Breakout Ventures]] within his ideological and financial orbit. [[Breakout Ventures]] leveraged the [[Breakout Labs]] grant program as a strategic mechanism to identify and cultivate its investment opportunities in science-driven companies, transitioning from philanthropic grants to traditional venture capital. Its network of financial partners includes other significant venture capital firms such as [[Founders Fund]] (also closely associated with [[Peter Thiel]]), [[Formation 8]], [[OATV]], [[Lux Capital]], and [[Khosla Ventures]], indicating a shared ecosystem of influence and capital deployment. Through these partnerships, [[Breakout Ventures]] exerts influence across various technology, biology, and chemistry sectors via investments in companies like [[Noetik]], [[Cytovale]], [[Passkey Therapeutics]], [[Corpernic Catalysts]], [[EnPlusOne Biosciences]], and [[Phantom Neuro]].
