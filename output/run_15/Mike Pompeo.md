[[Mike Pompeo]] served as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] and later as [[United States Secretary of State]] under [[Donald Trump]], demonstrating his access to and influence within the highest levels of U.S. government. His network of influence includes former [[West Point]] classmates [[Brian Bulatao]] and [[Ulrich Brechbuhl]], with whom he co-founded [[Thayer Aerospace]], forming what some refer to as the "[[West Point Mafia]]" in government. Through [[Thayer Aerospace]], [[Mike Pompeo]] secured significant venture funding from entities like [[Koch Industries]], a powerful political donor, establishing an early financial connection that continued with [[Koch Industries]] becoming a partner for his subsequent venture, [[Sentry International]], and a major donor to his congressional campaigns. During his tenure at the [[CIA]], [[Mike Pompeo]] appointed his former business partner [[Brian Bulatao]] as [[CIA Chief Operating Officer]], further consolidating his inner circle within a key intelligence agency. [[Mike Pompeo]] displayed controversial influence over intelligence and foreign policy, including invoking state secrets privilege to shield [[CIA]] officers from testifying, describing [[WikiLeaks]] as a "hostile intelligence service," and admitting that as [[CIA Director]], "We lied, we cheated, we stole." His ideological connections were evident as he planned to hire chaplains at the [[CIA]] at the suggestion of [[Tony Perkins]], president of the [[Family Research Council]], and later, as Secretary of State, promoted a speech "On Being a Christian Leader" applying his faith to government work, leading to concerns about the [[separation of church and state]]. As [[Secretary of State]], [[Mike Pompeo]] was a staunch loyalist to [[Donald Trump]], actively supporting his objectives, including efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and leading to the firing of State Department inspector general [[Steve Linick]] and smear campaigns against career diplomat [[Marie Yovanovitch]]. [[Mike Pompeo]] exerted significant influence over Middle East policy, advocating for moving the [[American Embassy in Israel]] to [[Jerusalem]], brokering the [[Abraham Accords]] between [[Israel]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], supporting [[Israel–United States relations]] with ideological justifications, and declaring [[Israeli settlements in occupied West Bank]] were not a violation of international law. He played a critical role in major foreign policy decisions, including being a hawkish advisor in the drone strike assassination of [[Qasem Soleimani]] and disputing the [[CIA]]'s assessment that [[Mohammad bin Salman]] ordered the assassination of [[Jamal Khashoggi]], later denigrating Khashoggi in his book. [[Mike Pompeo]]'s foreign policy stances consistently opposed the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and its leader [[Xi Jinping]], criticizing their policies regarding [[Uyghurs]] and Hong Kong, yet he failed to disclose business links between his former company and a Chinese government-owned firm during his [[CIA]] confirmation. He engaged directly with global adversaries, meeting with [[North Korea]]'s [[Kim Jong-un]] to prepare for summits with [[Donald Trump]] and also with [[Russia]]'s [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Sergey Lavrov]] to discuss various geopolitical issues, including alleged Russian election interference. Despite publicly supporting the [[Hong Kong democracy activist]] movement, [[Mike Pompeo]] declined to offer consular protection to figures like [[Joshua Wong]] due to concerns over retaliation from Beijing and broader U.S. interests, as discussed in a [[House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party]] hearing.
