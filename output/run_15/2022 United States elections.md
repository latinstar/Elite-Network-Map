The [[2022 United States elections]] saw the [[Republican Party]] win a majority in the [[House of Representatives]] and the [[Democratic Party]] expand its [[Senate]] majority, outperforming historical trends and defying predictions of a "red wave". The [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s decision in [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]] to overturn [[Roe v. Wade]] significantly shaped the [[2022 United States elections]], making abortion a major issue that boosted [[Democratic Party]] voter fervor. [[Donald Trump]]'s extensive influence on the [[2022 United States elections]] was evident through his crucial endorsements of numerous [[Trump-endorsed Republican candidates]], many of whom promoted his false claims of 2020 election fraud. The widespread denial of 2020 election results by many [[Trump-endorsed Republican candidates]], including [[Kari Lake]] who refused to commit to accepting her election outcome, represented a key ideological current impacting the discourse of the [[2022 United States elections]]. Strategically, [[Democratic campaign arms]] actively aided radical-right candidates in [[Republican Party]] primaries for the [[2022 United States elections]], believing these candidates would be easier opponents in the general election. [[President Joe Biden]]'s low approval ratings and his administration's handling of inflation, crime, and gas prices were central Republican talking points influencing voter sentiment in the [[2022 United States elections]]. [[President Joe Biden]]'s executive order on student loan forgiveness was a strategic move by the [[Democratic Party]] to attract young voters during the [[2022 United States elections]], although it faced legal challenges from conservatives and Republicans. [[Florida Governor Ron DeSantis]]'s landslide reelection in a previously swing state and his political stunt of sending migrants to [[Martha's Vineyard]] highlighted key [[Republican Party]] campaign themes on immigration for the [[2022 United States elections]]. The [[Democratic Party]] pursued legal action to remove [[Green Party]] candidates, such as [[Matthew Hoh]], from ballots in the [[2022 United States elections]] in states like North Carolina, aiming to prevent vote splitting that could benefit Republicans. [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]], a Russian national, claimed interference in US elections, including the [[2022 United States elections]], suggesting a potential foreign influence angle. [[President Joe Biden]] cited the attack on [[Paul Pelosi]] as an example of political violence fueled by [[Donald Trump]]'s false claims about the 2020 election, framing it as a threat to democracy on the ballot for the [[2022 United States elections]]. The signing of the [[Inflation Reduction Act]] by [[President Joe Biden]] in August 2022, which included significant climate change policies, was a legislative action intended to positively influence the [[Democratic Party]]'s standing in the [[2022 United States elections]]. The [[Roberts Court]]'s decision expanding gun rights prior to the [[2022 United States elections]] further exacerbated the debate on gun control, an issue on which the [[Democratic Party]] pushed for stricter laws and the [[Republican Party]] sought to protect Second Amendment access. The actions of centrist Democrats [[Joe Manchin]] and [[Kyrsten Sinema]], who blocked more progressive legislation before the [[2022 United States elections]], highlighted internal power dynamics within the [[Democratic Party]] that affected its pre-election legislative record. The [[Republican Party]]'s internal division on abortion policies, exemplified by [[Lindsey Graham]]'s federal ban proposal, impacted their unified messaging and strategy leading into the [[2022 United States elections]]. Perceived support for [[Russia]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] by some within the [[Republican Party]] also influenced foreign policy narratives in the run-up to the [[2022 United States elections]].
