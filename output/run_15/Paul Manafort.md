Paul John Manafort Jr. (/ˈmænəfɔːrt/; born April 1, 1949) is an American former [[Lobbyist|lobbyist]], [[Political consultant|political consultant]], and [[Lawyer|attorney]].
A long-time [[Republican Party]] campaign consultant, he chaired the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Trump presidential campaign]] from June to August 2016.
Manafort served as an adviser to the U.S. presidential campaigns of Republicans [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.
Bush]], and [[Bob Dole]].
In 1980, he co-founded the Washington, D.C.–based lobbying firm [[Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly|Black, Manafort & Stone]], along with principals [[Charles R.
Black Jr.]] and [[Roger Stone]],[1][2][3] joined by [[Peter G.
Kelly]] in 1984.[4] Manafort often lobbied on behalf of foreign leaders such as former [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]], former dictator of the [[Philippines]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], former dictator of [[Zaire]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], and [[Angola|Angolan]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[UNITA|leader]] [[Jonas Savimbi]].[5][6][7] Lobbying to serve the interests of foreign governments requires registration with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA); on June 27, 2017, he retroactively registered as a [[Foreign agent|foreign agent]].[8][9][10][11]
On October 27, 2017, Manafort and his business associate [[Rick Gates]] were indicted in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] on multiple charges arising from his consulting work for the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych in [[Ukraine]] before Yanukovych's [[Revolution of Dignity|overthrow in 2014]].[12] The indictment came at the request of [[Robert Mueller]]'s [[Mueller special counsel investigation|Special Counsel investigation]].[13][14] In June 2018, additional charges were filed against Manafort for [[Obstruction of justice|obstruction of justice]] and [[Witness tampering|witness tampering]] that are alleged to have occurred while he was under house arrest,[15] and he was ordered to jail.[16]
In August 2018, he stood trial in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] [[Trials of Paul Manafort|and was convicted]] on eight charges of tax and bank fraud.
Manafort was next prosecuted on ten other charges, but this effort ended in a [[Mistrial|mistrial]] with Manafort later admitting his guilt.[17][18][19] In the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], Manafort pled guilty to two charges of [[Conspiracy against the United States|conspiracy to defraud the United States]] and [[Witness tampering|witness tampering]],[20] while agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors.
On February 13, 2019, D.C. District Court Judge [[Amy Berman Jackson]] concurred, voiding the plea deal.[21][22][23] On March 7, 2019, Judge [[T.
Ellis III]] sentenced Manafort to 47 months in prison.[24][25][26] On March 13, 2019, Jackson sentenced Manafort to an additional 43 months in prison.[27][28][29] Minutes after his sentencing, New York state prosecutors charged Manafort with sixteen state felonies.[30] On December 18, 2019, the state charges against him were dismissed because of the doctrine of [[Double jeopardy|double jeopardy]].[31][32][33] The Republican-controlled [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] concluded in August 2020 that Manafort's ties to individuals connected to Russian intelligence while he was Trump's campaign manager "represented a grave counterintelligence threat" by creating opportunities for "Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump campaign."[34]
On May 13, 2020, Manafort was released to home confinement due to the threat of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].[35] On December 23, 2020, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] [[Pardon|pardoned]] Manafort.[36][37][38]
In mid-March 2024, Manafort re-emerged on the political scene, with reports of him potentially joining the [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign|Trump 2024]] campaign.[39][40][41] Manafort was reportedly supporting [[Sali Berisha]].[42][43][44][45]
Paul John Manafort Jr. was born on April 1, 1949,[46] in [[New Britain, Connecticut]].
Manafort's parents are Antoinette Mary Manafort (née Cifalu; 1921–2003) and Paul John Manafort Sr. (1923–2013).[47][48] His grandfather immigrated to the United States from [[Italy]] in the early 20th century, settling in Connecticut.[49] He founded the construction company New Britain House Wrecking Company in 1919 (later renamed Manafort Brothers Inc.).[50] His father served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] combat engineers during [[World War II]][48] and was [[Mayor of New Britain, Connecticut|mayor of New Britain]] from 1965 to 1971.[5] His father was indicted in a corruption scandal in 1981 but not convicted.[51]
In 1967, Manafort graduated from [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School]], a private [[Roman Catholic]] secondary school, in New Britain.[52] He attended [[Georgetown University]], where he received his [[B.S.]] in [[Business administration|business administration]] in 1971 and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1974.[53][54]
Between 1977 and 1980, Manafort practiced law with the firm of [[Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease]] in Washington, D.C.[46]
In 1976, Manafort was the delegate-hunt coordinator for eight states for the [[Gerald Ford|President Ford Committee]]; the overall Ford delegate operation was run by [[James Baker|James A.
Baker III]].[55] Between 1978 and 1980, Manafort was the southern coordinator for [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign]], and the deputy political director at the [[Republican National Committee]].
After Reagan's election in November 1980, he was appointed associate director of the [[Presidential Personnel Office]] at the [[White House]].
In 1981, he was nominated to the board of directors of the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]].[46]
Bush in 1988]][56] and [[1996 United States presidential election|Bob Dole]] in 1996.[57]
Barrack Jr.]] He pointed out his experience advising presidential campaigns in the United States and around the world, described himself as an outsider not connected to the Washington establishment, and offered to work without salary.[58] In March 2016, he joined [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's presidential campaign]] to take the lead in getting commitments from convention delegates.[59] On June 20, 2016, Trump fired campaign manager [[Corey Lewandowski]] and promoted Manafort to the position.
On June 9, 2016, Manafort, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], and [[Jared Kushner]] were participants in [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|a meeting]] with Russian attorney [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]] and several others at [[Trump Tower]].
A British music agent, saying he was acting on behalf of [[Emin Agalarov]] and the Russian government, had told Trump Jr. that he could obtain damaging information on [[Hillary Clinton]] if he met with a lawyer connected to the [[Kremlin]].[63] At first, Trump Jr. said the meeting had been primarily about the Russian ban on international adoptions (in response to the [[Magnitsky Act]]) and mentioned nothing about Mrs.
In August 2016, Manafort's connections to former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and his pro-Russian [[Party of Regions]] drew national attention in the US, where it was reported that Manafort may have received $12.7 million (~$16.2 million in 2024) in off-the-books funds from the Party of Regions.[65]
Manafort stated in an internal staff memorandum that he would "remain the campaign chairman and chief strategist, providing the big-picture, long-range campaign vision".[68] However, two days later, Trump announced his acceptance of Manafort's resignation from the campaign after [[Steve Bannon]] and [[Kellyanne Conway]] took on senior leadership roles within that campaign.[69][70]
Upon Manafort's resignation as campaign chairman, [[Newt Gingrich]] stated, "nobody should underestimate how much Paul Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right now."[71] Gingrich later added that, for the Trump administration, "It makes perfect sense for them to distance themselves from somebody who apparently didn't tell them what he was doing."[72]
Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], a likely Russian intelligence officer and an alleged operative of the "Mariupol Plan" which would separate eastern Ukraine by political means with Manafort's help.[73] The filing says Manafort gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him.[74][75][34]
Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians [[Serhiy Lyovochkin]] and [[Rinat Akhmetov]].
During a February 4, 2019, closed-door court hearing regarding false statements Manafort had made to investigators about his communications with Kilimnik, special counsel prosecutor [[Andrew Weissmann]] told judge [[Amy Berman Jackson]] that "This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating," suggesting that Mueller's office continued to examine a possible agreement between Russia and the Trump campaign.[76]
While Manafort served within the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], it is alleged that Manafort, via [[Kyiv]]-based operative [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], offered to provide briefings on political developments to Deripaska.[77][78] Behaviors such as these were seen by writers at [[The Atlantic]] as an attempt by Manafort "to please an oligarch tied to" Putin's government.[79]
Black Jr.]] and [[Roger Stone]].[1][2][3][80] After [[Peter G.
Kelly]] was recruited, the name of the firm was changed to [[Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly]] (BMSK) in 1984.[4]: 124
In 1985, Manafort's firm, BMSK, signed a $600,000 (~$1.48 million in 2024) contract with [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of the Angolan rebel group [[UNITA]], to refurbish Savimbi's image in Washington and secure financial support on the basis of his anti-communism stance.
BMSK arranged for Savimbi to attend events at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (where [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] gave him a laudatory introduction), [[The Heritage Foundation]], and [[Freedom House]]; in the wake of the campaign, Congress approved hundreds of millions of dollars in covert American aid to Savimbi's group.[82] Allegedly, Manafort's continuing lobbying efforts helped preserve the flow of money to Savimbi several years after the Soviet Union ceased its involvement in the Angolan conflict, forestalling peace talks.[82]
Between June 1984 and June 1986, Manafort was a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|FARA]]-registered lobbyist for [[Saudi Arabia]].
An investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] found 18 lobbying-related activities that were not reported in FARA filings, including lobbying on behalf of [[The Bahamas]] and [[Saint Lucia]].[83]
Manafort's firm, BMSK, accepted $950,000 yearly to lobby for then-president of the [[Philippines]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].[84][85] He was also involved in lobbying for [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaire|Zaïre]],[86] securing a US$1 million (~$2.2 million in 2024) annual contract in 1989,[87] and attempted to recruit [[Siad Barre]] of [[Somalia]] as a client.[88]
His firm lobbied on behalf of the governments of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kenya]], earning between $660,000 and $750,000 each year between 1991 and 1993, and [[Nigeria]], earning $1 million in 1991.
These activities led Manafort's firm to be listed amongst the top five lobbying firms receiving money from human-rights abusing regimes in the [[Center for Public Integrity]] report "The Torturers' Lobby".[89]
[[The New York Times]] reported that Manafort accepted payment from the [[Kurdistan Region]] to facilitate Western recognition of the [[2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum]].[90]
Manafort wrote the campaign strategy for [[Édouard Balladur]] in the 1995 French elections, and was paid indirectly.[91] The money, at least $200,000, was transferred to him through his friend, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] arms-dealer Abdul Rahman al-Assir, from middle-men fees paid for arranging the sale of three French [[Agosta-class submarine|Agosta-class submarines]] to Pakistan, in a scandal known as the [[Karachi affair]].[82]
Manafort received $700,000 from the [[Kashmir|Kashmiri]] American Council between 1990 and 1994, supposedly to promote the plight of the Kashmiri people.
However, an FBI investigation revealed the money was actually from Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] (ISI) agency as part of a disinformation operation to divert attention from terrorism.
A former Pakistani ISI official claimed Manafort was aware of the nature of the operation.[92] While producing a documentary as part of the deal, Manafort interviewed several Indian officials while pretending to be a [[CNN]] reporter.[93]
In the late 1980s, Manafort was criticized for using his connections at [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] to ensure funding for a $43 million rehabilitation of dilapidated housing in [[Seabrook, New Jersey]].[94] Manafort's firm received a $326,000 fee for its work in getting HUD approval of the grant, largely through personal influence with [[Deborah Gore Dean]], an executive assistant to former HUD Secretary [[Samuel Pierce]].[95]
Manafort's involvement in Ukraine can be traced to 2003, when [[Russian oligarch]] [[Oleg Deripaska]] hired Dole, Manafort's prior campaign candidate, to lobby the State Department for a waiver of his visa ban, primarily so that he could solicit otherwise unavailable institutional purchasers for shares in his company, [[Rusal|RusAL]].[96][97] Then in early 2004, Deripaska met with Manafort's partner, [[Rick Davis]], also a prior campaign adviser to Bob Dole, to discuss hiring Manafort and Davis to return the former Georgian Minister of State Security, [[Igor Giorgadze]], to prominence in Georgian politics.[98]
By December 2004, however, Deripaska shelved his plans in Georgia and dispatched Manafort to meet with Akhmetov in Ukraine to help Akhmetov and his holding firm, System Capital Management, weather the political crisis brought by the [[Orange Revolution]].[98] Akhmetov would eventually flee to [[Monaco]] after being accused of murder, but during the crisis Manafort shepherded Akhemtov around Washington, meeting with U.S. officials like [[Dick Cheney]].[96][97][98] Akhmetov introduced Manafort to Yanukovych, to whose political party, the Party of Regions, Akhmetov was a contributor.[99]
Manafort worked as an adviser on the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential campaign]] of Yanukovych (and his Party of Regions during the same time span) from December 2004 until the February [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]],[99][100][101] even as the U.S. government (and U.S. Senator [[John McCain]]) opposed Yanukovych because of his ties to Russia's leader [[Vladimir Putin]].[57] Manafort was hired to advise Yanukovych months after massive street demonstrations known as the [[Orange Revolution]] overturned rigged Yanukovych's victory in the 2004 presidential race.[102]
[[Borys Kolesnikov]], Yanukovych's campaign manager, said the party hired Manafort after identifying organizational and other problems in the 2004 elections, in which it was advised by Russian strategists.[101] Manafort rebuffed U.S. Ambassador [[William B.
Taylor Jr.]] when the latter complained he was undermining U.S. interests in Ukraine.[82] According to a 2008 [[U.S. Justice Department]] annual report, Manafort's company received $63,750 from Yanukovych's Party of Regions over a six-month period ending on March 31, 2008, for consulting services.[103]
In the 2010 election, Yanukovych managed to pull off a narrow win over Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], a leader of the 2004 demonstrations.
In 2007 and 2008, Manafort was involved in investment projects with Deripaska—the acquisition of a Ukrainian telecommunications company—and [[Ukrainian oligarch]] [[Dmytro Firtash]]—redevelopment of the site of the former [[Drake Hotel]] in [[New York City]]).[104] Manafort negotiated a $10 million (~$15.4 million in 2024) annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005.[105] A witness at Manafort's 2018 trial for fraud and tax evasion testified that Deripaska loaned Manafort $10 million in 2010, which to her knowledge was never repaid.[51]
At [[Trials of Paul Manafort|Manafort's trial]], federal prosecutors alleged that between 2010 and 2014 he was paid more than $60 million by Ukrainian sponsors, including Akhmetov, believed to be the richest man in Ukraine.[51]
In May 2011, Yanukovych stated that he would strive for Ukraine to join the [[European Union]],[106] In 2013, Yanukovych became the main target of the [[Euromaidan]] protests.[107] After the February [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] (the conclusion of Euromaidan), Yanukovych fled to Russia.[107][108] On March 17, 2014, the day after the [[2014 Crimean referendum|Crimean status referendum]], Yanukovych became one of the first eleven persons who were placed under executive sanctions on the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control#Specially Designated Nationals List|Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)]] by [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]], freezing his assets in the US and banning him from entering the United States.[109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116][117][118][119][a]
Manafort then returned to Ukraine in September 2014 to become an adviser to Yanukovych's former head of the [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine]] [[Serhiy Lyovochkin]].[99] In this role, he was asked to assist in rebranding Yanukovych's Party of Regions.[99] Instead, he argued to help stabilize Ukraine.
Manafort was instrumental in creating a new political party called [[Opposition Bloc]].[99] According to Ukrainian political analyst Mikhail Pogrebinsky, "He thought to gather the largest number of people opposed to the current government, you needed to avoid anything concrete, and just become a symbol of being opposed".[99] According to Manafort, he has not worked in Ukraine since the October [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]].[120][121] However, according to Ukrainian border control entry data, Manafort traveled to Ukraine several times after that election, all the way through late 2015.[121] According to [[The New York Times]], his local office in Ukraine closed in May 2016.[65] According to [[Politico]], by then Opposition Bloc had already stopped payments for Manafort and this local office.[121]
In an April 2016 interview with [[ABC News]], Manafort stated that the aim of his activities in Ukraine had been to lead the country "closer to Europe".[122]
Ukrainian government [[National Anti-Corruption Bureau]] studying secret documents claimed in August 2016 to have found handwritten records that show $12.7 million in cash payments designated for Manafort, although they had yet to determine if he had received the money.[65] These undisclosed payments were from the pro-Russian political party Party of Regions, of the former president of Ukraine Yanukovych.[65] This payment record spans from 2007 to 2012.[65] Manafort's lawyer, Richard A.
Hibey, said Manafort didn't receive "any such cash payments" as described by the anti-corruption officials.[65] The Associated Press reported on August 17, 2016, that Manafort secretly routed at least $2.2 million in payments to two prominent Washington lobbying firms in 2012 on Party of Regions' behalf, and did so in a way that effectively obscured the foreign political party's efforts to influence U.S. policy.[10] Associated Press noted that under federal law, U.S. lobbyists must declare publicly if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties and provide detailed reports about their actions to the Justice Department, which Manafort reportedly did not do.[10] The lobbying firms unsuccessfully lobbied [[U.S. Congress]] to reject a resolution condemning [[Criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010|the jailing]] of Yanukovych's main political rival, [[Yulia Tymoshenko]].[123]
Financial records certified in December 2015 and filed by Manafort in Cyprus showed him to be approximately $17 million (~$21.9 million in 2024) in debt to interests connected to interests favorable to Putin and Yanukovych in the months before joining the Trump presidential campaign in March.[124] These included a $7.8 million debt to Oguster Management Limited, a company connected to Deripaska.[124] This accords with a 2015 court complaint filed by Deripaska claiming that Manafort and his partners owed him $19 million in relation to a failed Ukrainian cable television business.[124] In January 2018, Surf Horizon Limited, a Cyprus-based company tied to Deripaska, sued Manafort and his business partner [[Rick Gates|Richard "Rick" Gates]], accusing them of financial fraud by misappropriating more than $18.9 million that the company had invested in Ukrainian telecom companies, known collectively as the "Black Sea Cable".[125] An additional $9.9 million debt was owed to a Cyprus company that tied through [[Shell company|shell companies]] to Ivan Fursin [uk], a Ukrainian Member of Parliament of the Party of Regions.[124] Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni maintained in response, "Manafort is not indebted to Deripaska or the Party of Regions, nor was he at the time he began working for the Trump campaign."[124] During the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential campaign]], Manafort, via Kilimnik, offered to provide briefings on political developments to Deripaska, though there is no evidence that the briefings took place.[77][126] A July 2017 application by the FBI for a search warrant revealed that a company controlled by Manafort and his wife had received a $10 million (~$12.5 million in 2024) loan from Deripaska.[127][128]
According to leaked text messages between his daughters, Manafort was also one of the proponents of violent removal of the Euromaidan protesters, which resulted in police shooting dozens of people during [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots]].
Manafort has rejected questions about whether Kilimnik, with whom he consulted regularly, might be in league with Russian intelligence.[130] According to [[Yuri Shvets]], Kilimnik previously worked for the [[GRU]], and every bit of information about his work with Manafort went directly to Russian intelligence.[131]
Lobbying for foreign countries requires registration with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA).
In April 2017, a Manafort spokesman said Manafort was planning to file the required paperwork; however, according to [[Associated Press]] reporters, as of June 2, 2017, Manafort had not yet registered.[8][10] On June 27, he filed to be retroactively registered as a [[Foreign agent|foreign agent]].[11] Among other things, he disclosed that he made more than $17 million between 2012 and 2014 working for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.[132][133] The sentencing memorandum submitted by the Office of Special Council on February 23, 2019, stated that the "filing was plainly deficient.
Early in 2017, Manafort supported Chinese efforts at providing development and investment worldwide and in [[Puerto Rico]] and Ecuador.[135] Early in 2017, he discussed possible Chinese investment sources for Ecuador with [[Lenín Moreno]] who later obtained loans worth several billion US dollars from the [[China Development Bank]].[135] In May 2017, Manafort and Moreno discussed the possibility of Manafort brokering a deal for Ecuador to relinquish [[Julian Assange]] to American authorities in exchange for concessions such as debt relief from the United States.[136]
Manafort acted as the go between for the China Development Bank's investment fund to support bailout bonds for [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis|Puerto Rico's sovereign debt]] financing and other infrastructure items.[135] Also, he advised a Shanghai construction billionaire Yan Jiehe [zh] (严介和), who owns the [[Pacific Construction Group]] (太平洋建设) and is China's seventh richest man with a fortune estimated at $14.2 billion in 2015, on obtaining international contracts.[135][137][138]
In mid-2017, Manafort left the United States in order to help organize the [[2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum]] that was to be held on September 25, 2017, something that surprised both investigators and the media.[139] He was hired by the [[President of Kurdistan Region]] [[Masoud Barzani]]'s son [[Masrour Barzani]] who heads the [[Kurdistan Region Security Council]].[135][140] To help Manafort's efforts in supporting Kurdish freedom and independence, his longtime associate Phillip M.
Griffin traveled to [[Erbil]] prior to the vote.[135] The referendum was not supported by [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[James Mattis]].[141] Manafort returned to the United States just before both his indictment and the start of the [[2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict]] in which the [[Peshmerga]]-led Kurds lost the [[Mosul Dam]] and their main revenue source at the [[Baba Gurgur|Baba GurGur]] [[Kirkuk Field|Kirkuk oilfields]] to Iraqi forces.[142][143]
Manafort's work in Ukraine coincided with the purchase of at least four prime pieces of real estate in the United States, worth a combined $11 million, between 2006 and early 2012.[144] In 2006, Manafort purchased an apartment on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower for a reported $3.6 million (~$5.37 million in 2024).[145] Manafort, however, purchased the unit indirectly, through an LLC named after him and his partner [[Rick Davis|Rick Hannah Davis]], "John Hannah, LLC."[146] That LLC, according to court documents in Manafort's indictment, came into existence in April 2006,[147] roughly one month after the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|Ukrainian parliamentary elections]] that saw Manafort help bring Yanukovych back to power on March 22, 2006.[148] According to Afghan-Ukrainian journalist [[Mustafa Nayyem]], Akhmetov, the Ukrainian oligarch sponsoring Yanukovych, paid the $3 million purchase price for Manafort's Trump Tower apartment for helping win the election.[96] It was not until March 5, 2015, when Manafort's income from Ukraine dwindled,[149] that Manafort would transfer the property out of John Hannah, LLC, and into his own personal name so that he could take out a $3 million loan against the property.[150] The Trump Tower residence was claimed as Manafort's primary residence in order to receive a [[Tax abatement|tax abatement]], though Manafort also listed a Florida residence as his primary residence, also to gain tax breaks.[151] The property was since seized by the federal government, and listed for sale in 2019.[152]
Since 2012, Manafort has taken out seven home equity loans worth approximately $19.2 million (~$25.9 million in 2024) on three separate New York-area properties he owns through holding companies registered to him and his then son-in-law Jeffrey Yohai, a real estate investor.[153] In 2016, Yohai declared [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] for [[Limited liability company|LLCs]] tied to four residential properties held with the actor [[Jake Hoffman (actor)#1550 Blue Jay Way|Jake Hoffman]]; Manafort holds a $2.7 million (~$3.45 million in 2024) claim on one of the properties.[154]
For one home, loans of $6.6 million exceeded the value of that home; the loans are from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, Illinois, whose CEO, [[Stephen Calk]], was a campaign supporter of Donald Trump and was a member of Trump's economic advisory council during the campaign.[153] In July 2017, New York prosecutors subpoenaed information about the loans issued to Manafort during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In addition, Manafort is also a person of interest in the FBI counterintelligence probe looking into the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian government's interference in the 2016 presidential election]].[8]
On January 19, 2017, the eve of [[First inauguration of Donald Trump|Trump's presidential inauguration]], it was reported that Manafort was under active investigation by multiple federal agencies including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], and the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|financial crimes unit of the Treasury Department]].[159] Investigations were said to be based on intercepted Russian communications as well as financial transactions.[160] CNN reported in September 2017 that Manafort was wiretapped by the FBI "before and after the election ...
According to a subsequent CNN editor's note, however: "On December 9, 2019, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Justice Department Inspector General]] released a report regarding the opening of the investigation on Russian election interference and Donald Trump's campaign.
In the report, the IG contradicts what CNN was told in 2017, noting that the [[Crossfire Hurricane|FBI team overseeing the investigation]] did not seek FISA surveillance of Paul Manafort".[161][162]: 357 [163]
[[Special Counsel]] [[Robert Mueller]], who was appointed on May 17, 2017, by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to oversee the investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and related matters, took over the existing criminal probe involving Manafort.[8][164] On July 26, 2017, the day after Manafort's [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] hearing and the morning of his planned hearing before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], FBI agents at Mueller's direction conducted a raid on Manafort's [[Alexandria, Virginia]] home, using a search warrant to seize documents and other materials, in regard to the Russian meddling in the 2016 election.[165][166] Initial press reports indicated Mueller obtained a [[No-knock warrant|no-knock warrant]] for this raid, though Mueller's office has disputed these reports in court documents.[167][168] United States v.
In May 2017, in response to a request of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI), Manafort submitted over "300 pages of documents ...
A [[Congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] on Russia issues, including the [[Trump campaign-Russian meeting]], was scheduled by the [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] for July 26, 2017.
The [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] concluded in its August 2020 final report that as Trump campaign manager "Manafort worked with [[Konstantin Kilimnik|Kilimnik]] starting in 2016 on narratives that sought to undermine evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election" and to direct such suspicions toward Ukraine.
The Trump–Russia dossier, also known as the [[Steele dossier]],[184] is a [[Private intelligence agency|private intelligence]] report comprising investigation memos written between June and December 2016 by [[Christopher Steele]].[185] Manafort is a major figure mentioned in the Steele dossier, where allegations are made about Manafort's relationships and actions toward the Trump campaign, Russia, Ukraine, and Viktor Yanukovych.
On October 30, 2017, Manafort was arrested by the [[FBI]] after being indicted by a federal grand jury as part of Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign.[192][193] The indictment against Manafort and [[Rick Gates]] charged them with engaging in a [[Conspiracy against the United States|conspiracy against the United States]],[14][194] engaging in a conspiracy to [[Launder money|launder money]],[14][194] failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts,[14][194][b] acting as an [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|unregistered agent of a foreign principal]],[14][194] making false and misleading statements in documents filed and submitted under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA),[14][194] and making false statements.[14][194] Prosecutors claimed Manafort laundered more than $18 million (equivalent to $23,090,144 in 2024), money he had received as compensation for lobbying and consulting services for Yanukovych.[194][201]
Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges at their court appearance on October 30, 2017.[202][203] The US government asked the court to set Manafort's bail at $10 million and Gates at $5 million.[203] The court placed Manafort and Gates under [[House arrest|house arrest]] after prosecutors described them as flight risks.[204] If convicted on all charges, Manafort could have faced decades in prison.[205][206]
On February 22, 2018, both Manafort and Gates were further charged with additional crimes involving a tax avoidance scheme and bank fraud in Virginia.[218][219] The charges were filed in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]], rather than in the District of Columbia, as the alleged tax fraud overt actions had occurred in Virginia and not in the District.[220] The new indictment alleged that Manafort, with assistance from Gates, laundered over $30 million through offshore bank accounts between approximately 2006 and 2015.
Jackson subsequently set a trial date of September 17, 2018, and reprimanded Manafort and his attorney for violating her [[Gag order|gag order]] by issuing a statement the previous week after former co-defendant Gates pleaded guilty.
Friends of Manafort announced the establishment of a [[Legal defense fund|legal defense fund]] on May 30, 2018, to help pay his legal bills.[229]
Since this allegedly occurred while Manafort was under house arrest, Judge Jackson revoked Manafort's bail on June 15 and ordered him held in jail until his trial.[231] Manafort was booked into the [[Northern Neck Regional Jail]] in Warsaw, Virginia, at 8:22 PM on June 15, 2018, where he was housed in the VIP section and kept in [[Solitary confinement|solitary confinement]] for his own safety.[232][233][234][235] On June 22, Manafort's efforts to have the money laundering charges against him dismissed were rejected by the court.[236][237] Citing Alexandria's D.C. suburbia status, abundant and significantly negative press coverage, and the margin by which [[Hillary Clinton]] won the Alexandria Division in the 2016 presidential election, Manafort moved the court for a [[Change of venue|change of venue]] to [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on July 6, 2018, citing Constitution entitlement to a fair and unbiased trial.[238][239] On July 10, Judge T.
Ellis ordered Manafort to be transferred back to the [[Alexandria City Jail|Alexandria Detention Center]], an order Manafort opposed.[240][241]
District Attorney [[Cyrus Vance Jr.]] said the charges stemmed from an investigation launched in March 2017.[243] Unlike his previous convictions, these were levied by the State of New York, and therefore a presidential pardon cannot override or affect the sentence in the event of conviction.[30] NBC News reported in August 2017 that a state investigator was exploring jurisdiction to charge potential defendants in the Mueller probe with state crimes, and that such charges could provide an end run around any presidential pardons.[244]
On December 18, 2019, Justice Maxwell Wiley of the [[New York Supreme Court]], Criminal Term, New York County, dismissed the charges against Manafort.[31][32][33] On August 20, 2020, the New York County District Attorney's Office appealed the dismissal to the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]].[245][246] In October 2020, a panel of the Appellate Division unanimously upheld the dismissal.[247][248]
After Manafort was pardoned in December 2020 for his federal crimes, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it would continue to pursue state charges.[249] However, on February 4, 2021, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] declined to hear the Manhattan District Attorney's appeal.[250][251]
Manafort was tried in the Eastern District of Virginia on eighteen charges including tax evasion, bank fraud, and hiding foreign bank accounts - financial crimes uncovered during the [[Mueller special counsel investigation|special counsel's investigation]] into Russia's role in the 2016 election.[18] The trial began on July 31, 2018, before U.S. District Judge [[T.
Ellis III]].[252][253] On August 21, the jury found Manafort guilty on eight of the eighteen charges, while Ellis declared a [[Trial#Mistrials|mistrial]] on the other ten.[18] He was convicted on five counts of tax fraud, one of the four counts of failing to disclose his foreign bank accounts, and two counts of bank fraud.[254]
The jury was hung on three of the four counts of failing to disclose, as well as five counts of bank fraud, four of them related to the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago run by [[Stephen Calk]].[255] Mueller's office advised the court that Manafort should receive a sentence of 20 to 24 years,[256] a sentence consistent with federal guidelines, but on March 7, 2019, Ellis sentenced Manafort to just 47 months in prison, less nine months for time already served, adding that the recommended sentence was "excessive" and that Manafort had lived an "otherwise blameless life." However, Ellis noted that Manafort had not expressed "regret for engaging in wrongful conduct".[257][258][259]
Manafort's trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was scheduled to begin in September 2018.[223] He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering, failing to register as a foreign lobbyist, making false statements to investigators, and witness tampering.[260] On September 14, 2018, Manafort entered into a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to two charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States and [[Witness tampering|witness tampering]].[261] He also agreed to forfeit to the government cash and property worth an estimated $11-$26 million,[262] and to co-operate fully with the Special Counsel.[263] A tentative sentencing date for Manafort's guilty plea in the D.C. case has been set for March 2019.[264]
In a February 7, 2019, hearing before [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] Judge [[Amy Berman Jackson]], prosecutors speculated that Manafort had concealed facts about his activities to enhance the possibility of his receiving a pardon.
They said that Manafort's work with Ukraine had continued after he had made his plea deal and that during the Trump campaign, he met with his campaign deputy Rick Gates, who also had pleaded guilty in the case, and with alleged Russian Federation intelligence agent, [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], in an exclusive New York cigar bar.
During that time he was briefly held at the [[United States Penitentiary, Canaan|United States Penitentiary Canaan]] in [[Waymart, Pennsylvania]].
He was held at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto]] in [[Loretto, Pennsylvania|Loretto]], [[Pennsylvania]] (inmate #35207-016).[269] In June 2019, he was moved to the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York]] in [[Manhattan]].[270] In August 2019, he was moved back to the Federal Correctional Institution, Lorretto, Pennsylvania with an expected release date of December 25, 2024.[270] On May 13, 2020, Manafort was released to home confinement over COVID-19 concerns.[271] On December 23, 2020, Trump issued Manafort a full pardon.[272]
Whitfield Larrabee filed a misconduct complaint against Manafort in the Connecticut Statewide Grievance Committee, seeking his [[Disbarment|disbarment]] on the basis of "conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation."[274] In 2018, after Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy, the Connecticut Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel brought a case against Manafort.[275] In January 2019, ahead of a disbarment hearing, Manafort resigned from the Connecticut bar and waived his right to ever seek readmission.[276][277][278]
Manafort has been married to Kathleen Bond Manafort since August 12, 1978.[280] They have two daughters, including [[Jess Bond|Jessica]].[129]
