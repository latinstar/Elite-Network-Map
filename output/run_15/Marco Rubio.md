[[Marco Rubio]] currently holds significant power as the [[United States Secretary of State]] and acting [[National Security Advisor]] and [[Archivist of the United States]] since 2025, having been nominated by [[President-elect Trump]]. Previously, [[Marco Rubio]] served [[Florida]] in the [[U.S. Senate]] from 2011 to 2025 as a member of the [[Republican Party]]. His influence on U.S. policy in [[Latin America]] during the first [[Trump administration]] led to him being described as a "virtual secretary of state for Latin America." [[Marco Rubio]] is considered one of Congress's most hawkish members regarding [[China]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]], leading to his sanctioning and ban from entering [[China]] by the [[Chinese government]].

[[Marco Rubio]]'s political identity is deeply rooted in his [[Cuban American]] background, with his parents having immigrated from [[Cuba]] during the [[Fulgencio Batista]] regime, and his maternal grandfather, [[Pedro Victor Garcia]], fleeing [[Fidel Castro]]'s Cuba and later gaining legal status via the [[Cuban Adjustment Act]]. Early in his career, [[Marco Rubio]] interned for [[U.S. representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], a prominent Cuban American politician, and worked on [[Republican senator Bob Dole]]'s 1996 presidential campaign, establishing early connections within the Republican establishment.

As [[Speaker of the Florida House]], [[Marco Rubio]] notably hired 18 aides from former Governor [[Jeb Bush]]'s team, signaling a strong alignment with the [[Jeb Bush]] political machine. During his speakership, [[Marco Rubio]] aggressively pushed [[Florida]] to the political right, frequently clashing with Governor [[Charlie Crist]] over issues like casino gambling (leading to a successful lawsuit by Rubio, sided with by the [[Florida Supreme Court]]) and climate change initiatives. [[Marco Rubio]]'s property tax reform efforts garnered praise from anti-tax activist [[Grover Norquist]], who called him "the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country."

[[Marco Rubio]]'s professional network includes his legal work with firms like [[Broad and Cassel]] and a past consulting role for [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]], which raised questions about his legislative spending requests during his time in the [[Florida House of Representatives]]. He also co-owned a residence with fellow Florida state representative [[David Rivera]] while in [[Tallahassee]]. Despite past ethical scrutiny over his use of a [[Republican Party of Florida]] credit card, from which he was cleared of wrongdoing by the [[Florida Commission on Ethics]], [[Marco Rubio]] has ascended to the highest levels of U.S. foreign policy and national security leadership.
