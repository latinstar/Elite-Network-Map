The [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] serves as the head of state and the paramount political and religious authority, standing above the [[President of Iran]]. This lifetime office, currently held by [[Ali Khamenei]], was established by the [[1979 Constitution]], founded on [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s concept of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (Vilayat-e Faqih)]]. The [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] exercises extensive control by making final decisions on national planning, foreign policy, the economy, education, environmental issues, and electoral transparency, while also possessing the power to dismiss and reinstate presidential cabinet appointees. Critically, the [[Armed Forces]], [[Judiciary]], [[State Radio and Television]], [[Guardian Council]], and [[Expediency Discernment Council]] are all directly subject to the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]]. As commander-in-chief, the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] directly oversees the [[Armed Forces]] and dictates [[Iran]]'s regional policy, with the [[Quds Force]] directly reporting to the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and selecting all ambassadors to Arab countries, effectively limiting the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to ceremonial duties. Although the [[Assembly of Experts]] is constitutionally tasked with electing, supervising, and dismissing the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in practice, it has never challenged his decisions, largely because its members' candidacies are approved by the [[Guardian Council]], half of whose members are unilaterally appointed by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], and the other half are appointed by the [[Chief Justice of Iran]] (who is himself appointed by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]]) and then confirmed by the [[Majlis (Parliament)]]. This influence extends to the approval of all candidates for the [[Assembly of Experts]], [[President of Iran]], and [[Majlis (Parliament)]], with the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] capable of directing the [[Guardian Council]] to repeal candidate bans. The [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] is legally "inviolable," and any questioning or insulting him results in punishment. The constitutional amendment in 1989, influenced by [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], removed the requirement for the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] to be a [[Marja'-e taqlid]], paving the way for [[Ali Khamenei]]'s succession. The role of [[Iranian Vice Supreme Leader (Deputy Supreme Leader)]] was also incorporated into the authority of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]].
