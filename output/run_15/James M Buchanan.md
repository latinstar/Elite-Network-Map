[[James M. Buchanan]] was a pivotal figure in developing [[Public Choice Theory]], for which he received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. [[James M. Buchanan]] co-authored his seminal work, *[[The Calculus of Consent]]*, with [[Gordon Tullock]], initiating research into the self-interested motivations of politicians and bureaucrats. [[James M. Buchanan]] held significant ideological positions as a member of the Board of Advisors for [[The Independent Institute]] and the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the [[Cato Institute]], and president of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] from 1984 to 1986. The academic work and intellectual leadership of [[James M. Buchanan]] at the [[University of Virginia]] and later [[Virginia Tech]], alongside colleagues like [[G. Warren Nutter]] and [[Gordon Tullock]], led to the formation of the influential [[Virginia school of political economy]]. [[James M. Buchanan]] co-founded the [[Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy and Social Philosophy]] at the [[University of Virginia]] with [[G. Warren Nutter]], explicitly aiming to preserve a "social order built on individual liberty." Through his 1959 report "[[The Economics of Universal Education]]" co-authored with [[G. Warren Nutter]], [[James M. Buchanan]] provided theoretical arguments that were leveraged during Virginia's "massive resistance" to school desegregation, presenting an opportunity to promote his [[Libertarian Theory]] of education. [[James M. Buchanan]] established and directed the [[Center for Study of Public Choice]] first at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI)]] with [[Gordon Tullock]] and [[Charles J. Goetz]], then controversially relocating the entire unit to [[George Mason University]], significantly influencing GMU's growth and academic standing. [[James M. Buchanan]] was a crucial influence on policy circles, with individuals like [[James C. Miller III]], who later served as Budget Director for U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], consulting with him at the [[Center for Study of Public Choice]]. The [[Liberty Fund]], a free-market think tank funded by [[Pierre F. Goodrich]], actively supported [[James M. Buchanan]]'s ideological work by hosting conferences on his economic policy and liberty, and publishing *[[The Collected Works of James Buchanan]]*. [[James M. Buchanan]]'s ideological development was profoundly shaped by mentors such as [[Frank Knight]] at the [[University of Chicago]], who converted him to market-oriented economics, and by economists like [[Knut Wicksell]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and the [[Italian school of public finance theory]] (including [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]], [[Antonio De Viti De Marco]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]) whom he considered intellectual forefathers of [[Public Choice Theory]].
