[[Crypto AG]], founded by [[Boris Hagelin]] in 1952, was secretly purchased in 1970 by the [[US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] and the [[West German Federal Intelligence Service (BND)]] for a joint intelligence operation code-named [[Operation Rubicon]], which the CIA also called [[Operation Minerva]] (initially [[Operation Thesaurus]]). This secret ownership allowed [[Crypto AG]] to sell backdoored encryption products to over 120 countries, including [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and multiple [[Latin American nations]], thereby enabling intelligence agencies like the [[National Security Agency (NSA)]], [[Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)]], and the [[BND]] to easily break their codes. The founder, [[Boris Hagelin]], had a long-standing, unwritten agreement with [[William F. Friedman]], chief cryptologist for the [[NSA]], where [[Crypto AG]] compromised the security of its C-52 machines and restricted sales of advanced models like the CX-52 to certain countries, while the [[NSA]] wrote some of [[Crypto AG]]'s operations manuals to ensure the full strength of the machines would not be used. [[Boris Hagelin]]'s lawyer, [[Stuart Hedden]], becoming deputy commander and Inspector General in the [[CIA]] in 1952, further illustrates direct high-level connections between individuals associated with [[Crypto AG]] and US intelligence. Correspondence regarding which countries [[Crypto AG]] would sell encryption systems to, and which would receive older, weaker ones, continued between [[Crypto AG]] and [[NSA]] officials like [[Howard C. Barlow]] and [[Lawrence E. Shinn]] after [[William F. Friedman]]'s retirement. The complicity of [[Crypto AG]] machines in intelligence gathering became apparent when deciphered communications from [[Libya]] via [[Crypto AG]] equipment linked [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to the [[West Berlin discotheque bombing]] in 1986, and when deciphered [[Iranian Intelligence Service]] messages, using [[Crypto AG]] equipment, raised suspicions after the assassination of [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] in 1991. A parliamentary investigation revealed that the [[Swiss intelligence service]] and the [[Swiss government]] were aware of and benefited from the US-led spying activities facilitated by [[Crypto AG]] for many years. After its liquidation in 2018, [[Crypto AG]]'s assets led to the creation of [[CyOne]] for Swiss domestic sales and [[Crypto International AG]], founded by [[Andreas Linde]], which later faced [[Swiss government]] export controls, causing diplomatic tensions with [[Sweden]]. [[Crypto AG]] also expanded its network by acquiring [[InfoGuard AG]] in 1994, which provided encryption solutions to banks, and selling [[G.V. LLC]] in 2010, a company focused on encryption and interception solutions. The full extent of [[Crypto AG]]'s secret ownership and pervasive role in global intelligence operations was publicly revealed in 2020 by a joint investigation involving [[The Washington Post]], [[ZDF]], and [[SRF]].
