Phat Beach is a 1996 American [[Comedy film|comedy film]] directed by [[Doug Ellin]], which stars [[Jermaine 'Huggy' Hopkins]], [[Coolio]], [[Brian Hooks]] and Gregg Vance.
The movie has been considered to be "one of the greatest (and perhaps only) [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] [[Beach party film|beach movies]] of all time."[3]
Benny King, an overweight, self-conscious teen in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California, faces the prospect of a dismal summer when his father Carl pushes him to get a job at a hamburger joint.
While Benny's family is on vacation, he borrows his father's Mercedes convertible and heads to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] with Durrel.
Though Benny and Durrel intend to sell cheap sunglasses to beach-goers so Benny can afford a [[Poetry|poetry]] class, Durrel gets distracted with all the attractive women around.
The duo get into a variety of misadventures, including running into [[Coolio]] at a first-class hotel and signing up for a volleyball tournament when they realize they are out of money.
The film was the directorial debut of [[Doug Ellin]], who was offered the chance to direct by producer Cleveland O'Neal based on a short film he made titled The Waiter.[3] O'Neal envisioned Phat Beach to be the first hip-hop [[Beach party film|beach movie]].[3]
Due to the film being non-[[SAG-AFTRA|union]], much of the cast, with the exception of [[Jermaine Hopkins]], consisted of unknown actors appearing in their first feature film.[3] Before Hopkins was cast in the role of Benny, [[Anthony Anderson]] had read for the part.[3]
The soundtrack album for the film was released on August 7, 1996, through [[TVT Records|TVT Soundtrax]] and consisted primarily of hip hop and R&B music.
The album reached number 40 on the [[Top R&B Albums]] chart.
At the time of release, Phat Beach received negative responses from critics who described the film as little more than a puerile [[Sex comedy|sex comedy]].[6][7] Roger Hurlburt of the [[Orlando Sentinel]] lamented that "women are treated as brainless, money-grubbing half-wits who swoon over dirty comments, vulgar flattery and a fancy car", and added "the plot is just an excuse for audiences to gape at a group of outrageously bosomy women removing bikini tops.
In contrast, Amy Wu of the [[Chicago Tribune]] gave a positive review and wrote, "Phat Beach is a fun movie, and that's all it's meant to be."[9] She added, "Simplicity is what makes Phat Beach so enjoyable", but "behind the simplicity is something revolutionary...The cast is multiethnic, the main characters are not white and the music comes from rap artist Coolio instead of the [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]".[9] The [[Los Angeles Times]]' [[Kevin Thomas]] felt the film is familiar at points, but praised the comedic chemistry between Hopkins and Hooks, in addition to the soundtrack.[10]
Stephen Gaydos of [[Variety]] gave a more mixed review, writing, "Cooked up for young fans of the [[House Party]] comedies and the [[Wayans family|Wayans brothers]]' raucous outings, Phat's bite on the genre is too bland and its gags too warmed-over to satisfy the hunger of its targeted auds."[4] Gaydos appreciated that some of Durrel's cruder attitudes about women "are counterbalanced by Benny’s constant criticism and belief in treating women with respect."[4] Though he felt Coolio's appearance was too brief, he concluded, "First-time helmer Doug Ellin deserves credit for steering the sub-par script without resorting to [[MTV]]-style visual gimmicks, which only would have made the situation more derivative than it already is.
Over the years, the film went on to develop a [[Cult following|cult following]], with [[Chris Rock]] and [[Kendrick Lamar]] being among its fans.[3]
