[[Blake Masters]] is widely considered a protégé of venture capitalist and elite political donor [[Peter Thiel]], with whom he co-authored the book [[Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future]]. He served as chief operating officer of [[Thiel Capital]], [[Peter Thiel]]'s investment firm, and as president of the [[Thiel Foundation]], resigning from both to pursue his political campaigns. [[Peter Thiel]] was a significant financial backer of [[Blake Masters]]' 2022 Senate campaign, contributing $15 million and seeding the pro-Masters super PAC [[Saving Arizona PAC]] with $10 million, later adding $3.5 million. [[Blake Masters]] aligned himself with controversial political operative [[Donald Trump]], who endorsed his 2022 Senate bid and whose claims about the stolen 2020 presidential election [[Blake Masters]] echoed, appearing with [[Donald Trump]] at a fundraiser at [[Mar-a-Lago]]. During [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 presidential transition, [[Blake Masters]] and [[Peter Thiel]] were tasked with recommending appointees for the administration. Ideologically, [[Blake Masters]] has cited [[Beautiful Losers]], a collection of essays by white supremacist writer [[Sam Francis]], as an influence on his conservatism. [[Blake Masters]] identified domestic terrorist [[Ted Kaczynski]] as an "underrated subversive thinker," noting valuable insights in his manifesto, [[Industrial Society and Its Future]], while disavowing Kaczynski's violence. He also endorsed conspiracy theorist [[G. Edward Griffin]]'s claims linking the "[[Houses of Morgan and Rothschild]]" to historical events and invoked the [[Great Replacement conspiracy theory]] during his campaigns. In the 2024 U.S. House primary, [[Donald Trump]] initially supported [[Abe Hamadeh]] over [[Blake Masters]] but later endorsed both, aligning with [[JD Vance]]'s support for [[Blake Masters]]. [[Blake Masters]] has also questioned the [[FBI]]'s involvement in the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]]. However, [[Steven J. Law]], leader of a Republican-aligned super PAC, cancelled financial support for [[Blake Masters]]' 2022 Senate campaign due to poor candidate assessment.
