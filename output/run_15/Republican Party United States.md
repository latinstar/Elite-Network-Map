The [[Republican Party (United States)]] is a conservative political entity that originated in 1854, opposing the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] and the expansion of slavery, under leaders like [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Post-[[Reconstruction era]], the [[Republican Party (United States)]] shifted focus from civil rights to business interests and later implemented the [[Southern strategy]] to appeal to white voters disaffected by Democratic policies, thus realigning its base.

The 1980 election of [[Ronald Reagan]] marked a major ideological shift for the [[Republican Party (United States)]], consolidating a coalition of free market advocates, social conservatives, and foreign policy hawks, establishing [[Reagan-style conservatism]] as the dominant ideological faction for three decades. Since 2009, internal divisions have led the [[Republican Party (United States)]] to shift significantly towards [[right-wing populism]], which subsequently became its dominant faction.

This shift culminated in the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump]], whose leadership and agenda, known as [[Trumpism]], fundamentally reshaped the identity of the [[Republican Party (United States)]] and diminished the influence of its establishment conservative faction. Under [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] appointed three Supreme Court justices – [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] – significantly influencing the judiciary.

The [[Republican Party (United States)]] under [[Donald Trump]] increasingly embraced election denial after the 2020 election and attempted to restrict voting based on unsubstantiated fraud claims. By the 2020s, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] has moved towards illiberalism, with research from the [[V-Dem Institute]] concluding it resembles Europe's most right-wing parties, such as [[Law and Justice (Poland)]] and [[Fidesz (Hungary)]].

In foreign policy, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] generally supports U.S. aid to [[Israel]] but is divided on aid to [[Ukraine]] and supports improving relations with [[Russia]], driven by an isolationist [[America First]] foreign policy agenda empowered by [[Donald Trump]]'s ascent. The [[Tea Party movement]], which emerged in 2009, contributed to a global rise in [[right-wing populism]] that further influenced the [[Republican Party (United States)]].

The outsize role of conservative media, particularly [[Fox News]], was more trusted by the [[Republican Party (United States)]]'s base than traditional party elites, contributing to the organizational weakening of the party establishment and facilitating [[Donald Trump]]'s primary victory. Intense factionalism within the [[Republican Party (United States)]] is highlighted by the ousting of House leaders such as [[Eric Cantor]], [[John Boehner]], and [[Kevin McCarthy]] since 2009.

The 2024 presidential election victory of [[Donald Trump]] against [[Kamala Harris]] further solidified [[Trumpism]] as the dominant force within the [[Republican Party (United States)]], leading to muted internal criticism of Trump. As of 2025, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] achieved a federal government trifecta, controlling the presidency, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate.

Historically, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] saw the emergence of a [[neoconservative faction]] in the early 21st century, which significantly influenced the initial American response to the [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[war on terror]]. Early ideological factions within the [[Republican Party (United States)]] included the [[Radical Republicans]], who were heavily influenced by religious ideals and [[Evangelical Christians]], advocating for abolition and equal rights. The [[Republican Party (United States)]] has cultivated support among [[Evangelical Christians]] following the 1973 [[Roe v. Wade]] decision, solidifying this demographic as a key base. In 1912, former Republican president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] formed the [[Progressive Party]] after being rejected by the [[Republican Party (United States)]], running unsuccessfully as a third-party presidential candidate.
