The initial protest by [[SpaceX]] against [[NASA]] to the [[Government Accountability Office]] in 2004 regarding a sole-source contract led to the formation of the [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program, through which [[NASA]] awarded [[SpaceX]] $396 million for ISS resupply demonstration contracts. This early influence on government procurement was followed by [[SpaceX]] securing a pivotal $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract from [[NASA]] in 2008, which was instrumental in saving the company from near bankruptcy. The [[United States Department of Defense]] further engaged with [[SpaceX]] by purchasing the first two [[Falcon 1]] launches under the [[DARPA Falcon Project]] to evaluate hypersonic missile delivery. In 2015, [[SpaceX]] raised $1 billion in funding from significant private equity investors, [[Google]] and [[Fidelity Investments]], marking substantial financial influence. [[SpaceX]]'s market power also began to disrupt the decade-long monopoly of [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) in U.S. military payloads, leading [[Arianespace]] to request subsidies from [[European governments]] to compete. The company's expansion into military applications is evident with [[Starshield]], the military counterpart to its [[Starlink]] internet satellite constellation, which was extensively used during the [[Russia-Ukraine War]], prompting discussions with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) about temporarily using [[SpaceX]] launchers. In 2025, reports by [[ProPublica]] revealed [[Chinese investors]] were investing in [[SpaceX]] through offshore entities and direct equity, raising potential national security concerns. [[Elon Musk]], the founder of [[SpaceX]], initiated the company with a vision influenced by his engagement with the [[Mars Society]], and later demonstrated his ideological influence by relocating [[SpaceX]]'s headquarters from California to [[Starbase, Texas]], in direct response to the state's AB1955 bill. Furthermore, [[SpaceX]] deepened its strategic network by agreeing to invest $2 billion in [[xAI]], extending its reach into artificial intelligence. Finally, [[SpaceX]] strengthened its supply chain by acquiring its parachute supplier, [[Pioneer Aerospace]], out of bankruptcy in 2023.
