The [[PayPal Mafia]] comprises former [[PayPal]] employees and founders who have profoundly influenced [[Silicon Valley]] by founding or investing in numerous technology companies, including [[LinkedIn]], [[Palantir Technologies]], [[SpaceX]], [[Affirm]], [[Slide]], [[Kiva]], [[YouTube]], [[Yelp]], and [[Yammer]]. These individuals maintained strong social and business connections, collaborating to form new companies and venture firms, thereby inspiring the term [[PayPal Mafia]] and gaining recognition through features like a [[Fortune magazine]] article. The shared experience at [[PayPal]], characterized by intense competition and collective struggle, fostered lasting camaraderie, trust, and mutual support among its members, contributing to their collective success and influence in re-emerging consumer-focused internet companies after the [[dot-com bust of 2001]]. Ideologically, members like [[Peter Thiel]], [[David Sacks]], and [[Elon Musk]] have expressed libertarian and conservative political views. Conversely, [[Reid Hoffman]], another [[PayPal Mafia]] member, has shown influence as a major donor to [[Democratic campaigns]] and political initiatives. The [[PayPal Mafia]] is also projected to exert significant political influence, with [[The Economist]] noting their potential "take over [[America]]'s [[government]]" following a [[Donald Trump]] reelection. This political network is evidenced by [[Elon Musk]]'s substantial donation of over [[$250 million]] to [[Trump]]'s re-presidential campaign, and his subsequent appointment as head of the new [[Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]]. Further demonstrating this influence, [[David Sacks]], a [[PayPal Mafia]] member, became [[Trump]]'s advisor on [[AI]] and [[cryptocurrencies]]. The network also extends through a protégé relationship, where [[Peter Thiel]], a [[PayPal Mafia]] member, is connected to [[JD Vance]], who became [[Trump]]'s [[Vice President]].
