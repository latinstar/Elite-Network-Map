[[Sally Satel]] holds influential academic and think tank positions, serving as a lecturer at [[Yale University School of Medicine]], a visiting professor of psychiatry at [[Columbia University]], and a senior fellow at the conservative think tank, the [[American Enterprise Institute (AEI)]]. Her ideological influence is evident in her books, such as [[P.C. M.D.: How Political Correctness is Corrupting Medicine]], where she critiques the integration of social justice into medicine, and [[Drug Treatment: The Case for Coercion]]. [[Sally Satel]] engaged directly in U.S. policy-making as a [[Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow]] with the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions]] and served on the advisory committee for the [[Center for Mental Health Services of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]]. A key aspect of [[Sally Satel]]'s network of influence involves her advocacy for opioid prescription: in 2004, she wrote an op-ed for [[The New York Times]] defending [[OxyContin]] and criticizing "overzealous" law enforcement, a position that coincided with [[Purdue Pharma]] facing lawsuits. Investigations by [[ProPublica]] and [[AP]] revealed that [[AEI]], her employer, received funding from [[Purdue Pharma]], and [[Sally Satel]] allegedly shared drafts of her articles with [[Purdue Pharma]] officials and cited Purdue-funded studies, raising questions about influence despite her denial of awareness of the funding. More recently, in 2019, [[Sally Satel]] was sponsored by [[Our Ohio Renewal]], a non-profit founded by author and political figure [[JD Vance]], for a residency in an opioid-crisis-affected region of Ohio with the [[Ironton-Lawrence Community Action Agency]], indicating a connection to contemporary political operatives and specific social interventions.
