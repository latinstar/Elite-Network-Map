[[William J. Casey]] served as [[Director of Central Intelligence]] for the [[Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] from 1981 to 1987, overseeing the entire [[United States Intelligence Community]] during the [[Reagan administration]]. Prior to this, [[William J. Casey]] developed early intelligence connections in the [[Office of Strategic Services (OSS)]] as head of its Secret Intelligence Branch in Europe during World War II. [[William J. Casey]] leveraged his legal career, including partnerships at [[Buckner, Casey, Doran and Siegel]] and [[Hall, Casey, Dickler & Howley]] with [[Leonard W. Hall]], to accumulate wealth through ventures like the [[Institute for Business Planning]] and by conceptualizing the tax shelter via the [[Research Institute of America]]. His political influence expanded as Chairman of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] during the [[Nixon administration]], which brought him into an influence-peddling case involving [[John N. Mitchell]], [[Maurice Stans]], and international financier [[Robert Vesco]]. [[William J. Casey]] further deepened his ties to national security as a member of the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]] and through his roles as Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and Chairman of the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank)]]. Ideologically, [[William J. Casey]] co-founded the conservative [[Manhattan Institute]] with [[Antony Fisher]] and privately represented military dictatorships in [[Indonesia]] and [[South Korea]], which he controversially failed to disclose during his DCI confirmation. As campaign manager for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 presidential campaign, [[William J. Casey]] was instrumental in forming an alliance with [[George H. W. Bush]] and faced allegations of acquiring [[Jimmy Carter]]'s classified debate papers. Furthermore, [[William J. Casey]] was implicated in the [[October Surprise theory]] by [[Ben Barnes]] concerning discussions with [[John Connally]] about delaying the release of American hostages by [[Iran]] until after the 1980 election. During his tenure as DCI, [[William J. Casey]] elevated the role to Cabinet-level, re-expanded the [[Intelligence Community]]'s funding and personnel, and controversially lifted restrictions on the [[CIA]]'s covert operations, significantly increasing anti-Soviet activities under the [[Carter Doctrine]]. [[William J. Casey]] maintained covert international connections, including secretly briefing [[Pope John Paul II]] at the [[Vatican]] on Cold War developments. Most notably, [[William J. Casey]] was deeply entangled in the [[Iran-Contra affair]], with [[Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh]] finding evidence of his Cabinet-level advocacy in setting up covert networks to resupply the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]] and promoting secret arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], working with [[Robert C. McFarlane]], [[John M. Poindexter]], [[Oliver L. North]], and [[Richard V. Secord]]. Despite efforts to insulate the [[CIA]], evidence suggests [[William J. Casey]] was involved in these activities and may have attempted to conceal them, though no documentary proof linked him directly to the diversion of funds. [[William J. Casey]] was also a member of the elite [[Knights of Malta]] and attended secretive [[Le Cercle]] meetings, indicating his connections to powerful, discreet international networks. Posthumously, the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] exonerated [[William J. Casey]] regarding the October Surprise allegations.
