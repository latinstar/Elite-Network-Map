[[Black Cube]], a private intelligence agency, was founded in 2010 by former Israeli intelligence officers [[Dan Zorella]] and [[Avi Yanus]], and its personnel primarily comprise veterans from Israeli elite intelligence units, including [[IDF Military Intelligence]]. The firm's advisory board has featured prominent figures such as former [[Mossad]] chiefs [[Meir Dagan]] and [[Efraim Halevy]], along with [[Yohanan Danino]], [[Giora Eiland]], [[Adrian Leppard]], [[Asher Tishler]], [[Paul Reyniers]], [[Golan Malka]], and [[Itiel Maayan]], underscoring its deep ties to the Israeli intelligence community. [[Avi Yanus]] explicitly described a reciprocal relationship where former [[Israel Defense Forces (IDF)]] intelligence operators both advise [[Black Cube]] and contribute to its business network, a trend also noted by [[Forbes Israel]] in an expanding business intelligence sector alongside firms like [[GPW]] and [[K2]].

[[Black Cube]] provides intelligence and advisory services to wealthy individuals, oligarchs, and global corporations, having achieved favorable media coverage from [[Globes]] and been called the "Mossad" of the business world by [[Forbes Israel]]. The agency has drawn significant international criticism for its controversial tactics, including being criticized by an Ontario Court for attempting to discredit [[Ontario Justice Frank Newbould]] on behalf of its client [[Catalyst]] and its owner [[Newton Glassman]]. [[Black Cube]] was engaged by film executive [[Harvey Weinstein]], referred by former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], in 2016 to suppress sexual assault allegations, an effort detailed by [[Ronan Farrow]] in [[The New Yorker]] which involved tracking journalists and actresses like [[Rose McGowan]] using agents such as [[Stella Penn Pechanac]].

[[Black Cube]]'s activities have also extended into political influence, as aides to U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] contracted the firm to undermine the [[Iran Nuclear Deal]] by discrediting former [[Obama administration]] officials [[Colin Kahl]] and [[Ben Rhodes]], with [[The New Yorker]] connecting [[Black Cube]]'s research to a memo in the [[Trump White House]]. The firm supported [[Viktor Orban]]'s 2018 re-election campaign by gathering intelligence on individuals associated with [[George Soros]], an action that [[Tamar Zandberg]] criticized as an "Israeli embarrassment" given [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s [[Likud]] party's support for Orban. [[Haaretz]] later revealed that [[Black Cube]]'s objectives included tracing Iranian funds to expose alleged [[Obama administration]] collaboration with Iran in violation of law, to find additional parties for lawsuits.

[[Black Cube]]'s employees were convicted in Romania for harassment and hacking, and [[The Globe and Mail]] and [[Darknet Diaries]] have reported on the firm's alleged fabrication of evidence against civilians and targeting of journalists and [[Citizen Lab]] staff member [[John Scott-Railton]]. In a prominent case, [[Channel 12]] confirmed [[Black Cube]]'s involvement in targeting individuals investigating [[NSO Group]], alleging a smear campaign on behalf of [[Qatar]], though [[NSO Group]] chief [[Hulio Shalev]] later acknowledged one specific engagement of [[Black Cube]] for a Cyprus lawsuit related to [[NSO Group]].

Among its client engagements, [[Black Cube]] was hired by [[Vincent Tchenguiz]], a major donor to the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] and investor in [[SCL Group]], to challenge the [[UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO)]] regarding the collapse of [[Kaupthing]]. [[Black Cube]] was hired by then-president [[Joseph Kabila]] to spy on his political opponents in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and by [[Nochi Dankner]] to investigate [[Motti Ben Moshe]] concerning [[IDB Holding Corp. Ltd.]] and [[ExtraEnergy]]. Furthermore, [[Black Cube]] assisted [[Nobu Su]] of [[TMT]] in a dispute against [[Lakatamia Shipping]] involving [[Slagen Shipping]], supported [[Kfar Giladi Quarries]] against [[Caesarstone]], and exposed bribery between [[Antonio Somma]] and arbitration panels for [[AmTrust]]. [[Black Cube]] provided evidence for [[Rami Levy]] of [[Rami Levy Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing]] against [[Victory supermarket chain]] and for [[Alstom]] and [[Afcon]] in a bid dispute against [[Israel Railways]] and [[SEMI]]. In other cases, [[Black Cube]] gathered evidence for [[Gefen Biomed]] against [[Moshe (Mori) Arkin]] regarding [[cCam Biotherapeutics]] and [[Merck]], uncovered bribery involving Panamanian lawyer [[Janio Lescure]] and judges including [[Judge Oydén Ortega]] of the [[Supreme Court (Panama)]], traced hidden assets for [[Bank Hapoalim]] belonging to [[Motti Zisser]] and his son [[David Zisser]] (the [[Zisser family]]), exposed concealed assets of bankrupt businessman [[Eliezer Fishman]] (including those related to 'East-West UK'), and provided evidence for [[Beny Steinmetz]] regarding [[Vale SA]]'s alleged withholding of information.
