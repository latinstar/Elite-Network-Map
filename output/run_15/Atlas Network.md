[[Atlas Network]], formerly known as [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]], is a non-governmental 501(c)(3) organization founded in 1981 by British entrepreneur [[Antony Fisher]] to provide training, networking, and grants for [[libertarian]], [[free-market]], and [[conservative]] groups globally. Described as "a think tank that creates think tanks," [[Atlas Network]] partners with nearly 600 organizations in over 100 countries to share best practices and policy ideas, promoting "freedom-oriented idea entrepreneurs" and "classically liberal policies and ideas." Through its partners, [[Atlas Network]] influences public opinion and policymakers, teaching them "how to win the battle for hearts and minds" to "produce white papers, meet with politicos, liaise with the media, write legislation, and much more." [[Antony Fisher]] was influenced by [[Austrian School economist]] [[F.A. Hayek]] and his book [[The Road to Serfdom]], and [[F.A. Hayek]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Milton Friedman]] formally endorsed [[Atlas Network]].

[[Atlas Network]] has received funding from elite donors including the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] and the [[Charles Koch Institute]], as well as the [[Donors Trust]], [[Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation]], [[John Templeton Foundation]], and [[Lilly Endowment]]. Historically, [[Atlas Network]] also received funding from the [[ExxonMobil Foundation]], [[Sarah Scaife Foundation]], and [[ExxonMobil]] itself, though it denies receiving oil and gas company funding for "nearly 15 years" as of 2023/2025. A significant power dynamic involves [[Atlas Network]]'s historical role in channeling funding from tobacco corporations to think tanks to produce publications supportive of industry positions, with 57 percent of its U.S. partners receiving tobacco industry funding between 1990 and 2000, and the [[Tobacco Control Research Group]] noting its role in opposing tobacco control measures in Latin America.

[[Atlas Network]]'s CEO, [[Brad Lips]], advocates for a "freedom philosophy" and funding market-oriented non-profits, quoting [[Milton Friedman]] that the network's function is "to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable." The organization supports a global network of ideological think tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], [[Manhattan Institute]], [[Fraser Institute]], [[Macdonald–Laurier Institute]], and the [[Frontier Centre for Public Policy]], an [[Atlas Network]] partner where [[ACT New Zealand]] leader [[David Seymour]] once worked, among many others worldwide; some of these were initially founded by [[Antony Fisher]] and later became integral to the network. [[Atlas Network]]'s campaigns for deregulation and property rights have been noted by academic [[Karin Fischer]] as influencing the [[World Bank]]'s [[Doing Business Index]].

[[Atlas Network]] has been described as having ties to conservative movements, including the administration of [[Donald Trump]], [[Brexit]] in the United Kingdom, and anti-government protests in Latin America, such as the [[2023 Latin America Liberty Forum]] which opposed [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s policies. Its partners were linked to an online campaign using fake accounts against the Cuban government during the [[2021 Cuban protests]], and [[Atlas Network]] later partnered with Cuban anti-communism activist [[Ruhama Fernandez]]. While its partners opposed the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], [[Atlas Network]] worked with them to create the [[Ukraine Freedom Fund]] for humanitarian aid and partner support, demonstrating its capacity for strategic influence in geopolitical events. A 2024 study analyzing 52 [[Atlas Network]] partners found that some "conceive nationalist and authoritarian societal mobilization as a tactical or strategic opportunity to advance free market causes." Its leadership, including Executive Vice President for International Programs [[Tom Palmer]], actively promotes economic libertarian efforts in various countries, including post-Communist Eastern Europe, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and coordinated aid inside Ukraine.
