Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American businessman and programmer who co-founded the social media service [[Facebook]] and its parent company [[Meta Platforms]].
Zuckerberg briefly attended [[Harvard College]], and launched Facebook there in February 2004 with his roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].
Zuckerberg took the [[Initial public offering of Facebook|company public in May 2012]] with majority shares.
He became the world's youngest [[Self-made man|self-made]] billionaire[a] in 2008, at age 23, and has consistently ranked among the [[The World's Billionaires|world's wealthiest individuals]].
According to [[Forbes]], Zuckerberg's estimated net worth stood at US$251 billion as of October 2025, making him the third-richest person in the world.[3]
He has used his funds to organize multiple large donations, including the establishment of the [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]].
A film based on Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with Facebook, [[The Social Network]], was released in 2010 and won multiple [[Academy Awards]].
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in [[White Plains, New York]], to [[Jews|Jewish]] parents Dr. Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist, and Karen ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|née]] Kempner), a psychiatrist.[4][5] He and his three sisters (Arielle, [[Randi Zuckerberg|Randi]], and [[Donna Zuckerberg|Donna]]) were raised in a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] household[6] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]].[7] Their great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[8] Zuckerberg initially attended [[Ardsley High School]] before transferring to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].
The device used [[Machine learning|machine learning]] to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to [[Slashdot]][12] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from [[PC Magazine]].[13] [[The New Yorker]] once said of Zuckerberg, "some kids played computer games.
Mark created them."[7] While still in high school, he attended [[Mercy University|Mercy College]] taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[7]
The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at [[Harvard College|Harvard]] in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy".[7] He studied [[Psychology|psychology]] and [[Computer science|computer science]],[14] resided in [[Kirkland House]],[15] and belonged to [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]].[7] In his [[Sophomore|second]] year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups.[16] Later, he created a different program he initially called [[History of Facebook#FaceMash|Facemash]] that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos.
The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's [[Network switch|network switches]], preventing students from accessing the Internet.[18] In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission.
In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[20] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]].[21][22] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002.
Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], when he was using their ideas to build a competing product.[23] The three complained to [[The Harvard Crimson]], and the newspaper began an investigation in response.
Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until he decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]].[29] They began with [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], and [[Yale University]].[30]
Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his second year in order to complete the project.[31] Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and the other co-founders moved to [[Palo Alto, California]], where they leased a small house that served as an office.
Over the summer, Zuckerberg met [[Peter Thiel]], who invested in his company.
According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California, where Zuckerberg appreciated the "mythical place" of [[Silicon Valley]], the center of computer technology in California.[32][33] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company.[34] The same year, speaking at [[Y Combinator Inc|Y Combinator]]'s Startup School course at [[Stanford University]], Zuckerberg made a [[Ageism|controversial assertion]] that "young people are just smarter" and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people.[35]
Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg had sought the advice of former [[Netscape]] CFO [[Peter Currie]] regarding financing strategies for Facebook.[36] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that Facebook had reached the 500-million-user mark.[37]
In 2010, [[Steven Levy]], who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a [[Hacker culture|hacker]]".
Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better".[38][39] Facebook instituted "[[Hackathon|hackathons]]" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[38] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[39] "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy.
In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to [[MIT Technology Review]]'s [[TR35]] list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[40] [[Vanity Fair]] magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the [[Information Age]]".[41] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[42] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in [[New Statesman]]'s annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[43]
On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg met with then-Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[44][45] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Medvedev persuaded Zuckerberg to open a research center in Moscow instead of trying to lure away Russian programmers.
In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone [[VK]] had around 34 million.[46][47]
On August 19, 2013, [[The Washington Post]] reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[48]
At the 2013 [[TechCrunch Disrupt]] conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he was working towards registering the 5 billion people who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook.
Zuckerberg then explained that this was intertwined with the aim of the [[Internet.org]] project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, sought to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[49][50]
Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 [[Mobile World Congress]] (MWC), held in [[Barcelona]], Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates.
Alongside other American technology figures such as Jeff Bezos and [[Tim Cook]], Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician [[Lu Wei]], known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014.
The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he conversed in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]].[52]
Zuckerberg receives a [[One-dollar salary|one-dollar salary]] as CEO of Facebook.[53] In June 2016, [[Business Insider]] named Zuckerberg one of the "Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World" along with [[Elon Musk]] and [[Sal Khan]], due to the fact that he and his wife "pledged to give away 99% of their wealth-then estimated at $55.0 billion" (equivalent to $70,553,217,486 in 2024).[54]
On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement day, Zuckerberg, after giving a [[Commencement speech|commencement speech]],[55] received an honorary degree from Harvard.[56][57]
In January 2019, Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an [[End-to-end encrypted|end-to-end encrypted]] system for three major social media platforms, including Facebook, [[Instagram]] and [[WhatsApp]].[58] On August 14, 2020, Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices.
A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, [[I2hub|i2hub]], another campus-only service, created by [[Wayne Chang]] and focusing on [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer]] file sharing, was launched.
In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, [[Adam D'Angelo]], and [[Sean Parker]] launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called [[Wirehog]], a precursor to [[Facebook Platform]] applications, which was launched in 2007.[60][61][62]
In 2013, Zuckerberg launched [[Internet.org]], which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date.
The project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of [[Net neutrality|net neutrality]]; Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no internet.
Zuckerberg is a board member of the [[Solar sail|solar sail]] spacecraft development project [[Breakthrough Starshot]], which he co-founded with [[Yuri Milner]] and [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2016.[65]
Harvard students [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]] accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called [[ConnectU]]).[23] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007.
It was refiled soon thereafter in a [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|federal court]] in [[Boston]].
Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by [[The Winklevoss Chang Group]], an alleged partnership between ConnectU and [[I2hub|i2hub]].
In November 2007, court documents were posted on the website of [[02138]], a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni.
In 2005, Facebook co-founder [[Eduardo Saverin]] filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook, alleging that Zuckerberg had illegally spent Saverin's money on personal expenses.
In June 2010, then-Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]] after a "[[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day|Draw Muhammad]]" contest was hosted on Facebook.
Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact [[Interpol]] to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for [[Blasphemy law|blasphemy]].
Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the [[United Nations General Assembly]].[70][71]
In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood [[Pellet fuel|pellet fuel]] company in [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County, upstate New York]], filed a suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages.
In 2014, Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai|Kauaʻi]].
In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight "[[Quiet title|quiet title]] and [[Partition|partition]]" lawsuits against hundreds of [[Native Hawaiians|native Hawaiians]] to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage.[77] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a [[Facebook]] post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their "fair share".[77] When he learned that Hawaiian [[Property law|land ownership law]] differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits.
Zuckerberg paid $17 million (equivalent to $19,726,514 in 2024) to add 110 acres to his contentious 1,500-acre estate in [[Kauai]], in December 2021.[80]
On April 10 and 11, 2018, Zuckerberg testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]] regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]].[83][84] He called the whole affair a breach of trust between [[Aleksandr Kogan]], [[Cambridge Analytica]], and Facebook.[85] Zuckerberg refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] committee in the United Kingdom.[86]
On October 1, 2020, the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|US Senate Commerce Committee]] unanimously voted to issue [[Subpoenas|subpoenas]] to the CEOs of three top tech firms, including Zuckerberg, [[Google]]'s [[Sundar Pichai]] and [[Twitter]]'s [[Jack Dorsey]].
The subpoenas aimed to force the CEOs to testify about the legal immunity the law affords tech platforms under [[Section 230|Section 230 of the Communications Act]] of 1934.
US [[Republican Party|Republicans]] argued that the law unduly protected social media companies against allegations of anti-conservative censorship.[87]
During the hearing, he was questioned about Facebook's handling of user data, its role in the [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol Building]], and its efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech.
In a January 2024 [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearing on child safety and social media platforms, Zuckerberg, along with other tech CEOs, were questioned about their companies' practices.
He consistently opposed efforts to enhance well-being on Facebook and Instagram, overriding senior executives such as Instagram head [[Adam Mosseri]] and Global Affairs President [[Nick Clegg]], as revealed in an ongoing lawsuit.
A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, [[The Social Network]], was released on October 1, 2010, starring [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Zuckerberg.
After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."[92] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy".[93] The film is based on the book [[The Accidental Billionaires]] by [[Ben Mezrich]], which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than "reportage".[94] The film's screenwriter [[Aaron Sorkin]] told [[New York|New York magazine]], "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?".[95]
Upon winning the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer [[Scott Rudin]] thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a [[Metaphor|metaphor]] through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other".[96] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[97]
In January 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on [[Saturday Night Live]], which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg.
According to [[David Kirkpatrick]], former technology editor at [[Fortune]] magazine and author of [[The Facebook Effect|The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World]] (2011),[102] "the film is only 40% true ...
Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final clubs]] at Harvard, Zuckerberg stated that he had no interest in joining the clubs.[7] Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is "false".
Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of [[The Simpsons]] titled "[[Loan-a Lisa]]", which first aired on October 3, 2010.
In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention.
Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing [[Bill Gates]] and [[Richard Branson]] as examples.[104] On October 9, 2010, [[Saturday Night Live]] lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[105] [[Andy Samberg]] portrayed the role of Zuckerberg.
[[Stephen Colbert]] awarded a "Medal of Fear" to Zuckerberg at the [[or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] on October 30, 2010, "because he values his privacy much more than he values yours".[107] Zuckerberg appeared in the climax of 2013 documentary film [[Terms and Conditions May Apply]].[108][109][110] The [[South Park]] episode "[[Franchise Prequel]]" mocked him.
According to [[CNET]], he was portrayed as "a rosy-cheeked bully nerd who utters strange noises, makes peculiar kung fu gestures and turns up wherever he likes in people's houses".[111]
Zuckerberg founded the Startup:Education foundation.[112] It was reported in September 2010 that he had donated $100 million (equivalent to $144,193,499 in 2024) to [[Newark Public Schools]], the public school system of [[Newark, New Jersey]].[113][114] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[115] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project.
I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate."[116] Newark Mayor [[Cory Booker]] stated that he and New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[116] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[117][118]
In 2010, Zuckerberg, [[Bill Gates]], and investor [[Warren Buffett]] signed [[The Giving Pledge]], in which they said they would donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.[119] In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife [[Priscilla Chan]] said that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to "advancing human potential and promoting equality" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.[120][121]
In December 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the [[Silicon Valley Community Foundation]], to be executed by the end of the month—based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value (equivalent to $1,336,358,571 in 2024).
Later that month, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for that year.[122] [[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]] placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity (equivalent to $1,349,857,143 in 2024).[123]
In October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife donated $25 million (equivalent to $33,205,651 in 2024) to combat the [[Ebola virus disease]], specifically the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic]].[124][125] The couple endowed the foundation of the [[San Francisco General Hospital]] in February 2015 with $75 million (equivalent to $99,491,085 in 2024), which was the biggest individual donation to a U.S. public hospital.
Later in 2020, the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] passed a near-unanimous, non-binding measure condemning the renaming, citing concerns that a public hospital should not be named after an individual whose social media platform is accused of "endangering public health, spreading misinformation, and violating privacy".[126] On December 1, 2015, the couple pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion (equivalent to $59,694,651,130 in 2024), to the [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]] (CZI).[127] The funds would not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives.[128] Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as [[Bill Gates]], [[Warren Buffett]], [[Larry Page]], [[Sergey Brin]] and other billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a [[Limited liability company|limited liability company (LLC)]].
Some journalists and academics have said the CZI conducts [[Philanthrocapitalism|philanthrocapitalism]].[129][130][131]
In 2016, CZI gave $600 million (equivalent to $786,106,489 in 2024) to create the tax-exempt charity [[Chan Zuckerberg Biohub]], a collaborative research space in San Francisco's [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay district]] near the [[University of California, San Francisco]], with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF, [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Stanford University]].
Unlike foundations such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public, Biohub retained the right to commercialize any research it funds.
Inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source, with permission from Biohub.[132][133][134] To increase access to scientific research and promote open science, CZ Biohub requires its investigators and staff scientists to publish submitted manuscripts and related data on [[Preprint|preprints]] servers such as [[BioRxiv|bioRxiv]].[135][136] Amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Zuckerberg announced $25 million (equivalent to $30,374,823 in 2024) in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and $75 million (equivalent to $91,124,470 in 2024) in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by [[Facebook, Inc.]], where Facebook would market itself.[137]
In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in [[Westchester County, New York]], where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008.
Then [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as "no preference" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in [[United States elections, 2008|2008]] and [[United States elections, 2012|2012]].[138][139]
In February 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for then-New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]].
His particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[140][141] Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for then-Newark mayor [[Cory Booker]], who was running in the [[United States Senate special election in New Jersey, 2013|2013 New Jersey special Senate election]].[142] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million (equivalent to $144,193,499 in 2024) pledge from Zuckerberg to [[Newark Public Schools]].[143] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the [[Silicon Valley Community Foundation]], a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[144][145]
On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(4) lobbying group]] called [[FWD.us]].
The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was [[Joe Green]], a close friend of Zuckerberg.[146][147] The goals of the group include [[Immigration reform|immigration reform]], improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[148][149] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[150] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as [[League of Conservation Voters|The League of Conservation Voters]], [[MoveOn.org]], the [[Sierra Club]], [[Democracy for America]], CREDO, [[Daily Kos]], [[350.org]], and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either not buy or pull their Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the [[Keystone XL|Keystone XL pipeline]], and in opposition to [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]] among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.[151]
In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration]].
The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling that deemed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) unconstitutional.[153][154]
When questioned about the mid-2013 [[PRISM]] scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government "blew it".
Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015, which said that he wants "to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world" in response to the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Policies targeting Muslims|aftermath]] of the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] and the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]].[155][156][157][158] The statement also said that Muslims are "always welcome" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that, "[[Jewish culture|as a Jew]], my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities."[159][160]
On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "[[Black Lives Matter]]" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place.
Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.[161][162][163] The [[New York Daily News]] interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, "Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure."[161]
In January 2017, Zuckerberg criticized [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Trump travel ban|executive order]] to harshly limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.[164] He also funded a state-level ballot initiative for the [[2020 United States elections|2020 general election]] that would raise taxes by altering California's [[Split roll|Proposition 13]] to require the tax assessment of commercial and industrial properties in the state at market rate.[165]
At least among Republicans, he was generally seen as pro-[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].
In an August 2024 letter to the [[House Judiciary Committee]] however, Zuckerberg stated he regretted not doing more to resist pressure from the Biden administration to censor content related to [[COVID-19]].
By 2024, Zuckerberg was discouraging employee activism at Facebook, and according to [[The New York Times]], had privately described his politics as leaning towards [[Libertarianism|libertarianism]] or [[Classical liberalism|classical liberalism]].[166][167][168][169]
In Donald Trump's book [[Save America]], published in September 2024, Trump described Zuckerberg's visits to the White House and wrote, "We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 Presidential Election]]."[170] Two months later, they dined at the [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort, with Zuckerberg reportedly aiming to mend his and his firm's relationship with Trump after the latter won the election.[171] Around the same time, Meta reportedly donated $1 million to a Trump-related fund.[172] In January 2025, he said: "We now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning and that will defend our values and interests abroad."[173] Zuckerberg was one of a handful of technology leaders positioned prominently at Trump's inauguration.
In March 2025, Zuckerberg mentioned his relationship with the Trump administration while seeking a favorable settlement in an [[Antitrust case|antitrust case]] where the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) was asking for $30 billion.[174]
Zuckerberg met fellow student [[Priscilla Chan]] at a frat party during his second year at Harvard.
They began dating in 2003.[175] In September 2010, Chan, who was a medical student at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] at the time,[176] moved into his rented house in [[Palo Alto, California]].[177][178] They married on May 19, 2012, in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[179][180] Zuckerberg revealed in July 2015 that they were expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages.[181] Their first daughter  was born in December 2015.[182] They announced in a [[Chinese New Year]] video that their daughter's Chinese name is Chen Mingyu ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陈明宇).[183] Their second daughter was born in August 2017.[184] Zuckerberg and his wife welcomed their third daughter in March 2023 and announced the news across his social media pages.[185] The couple also have a [[Puli dog]] named Beast,[186] who had over two million followers on Facebook as of 2019.[187] Zuckerberg commissioned the visual artist [[Daniel Arsham]] to build a 7-foot-tall sculpture of his wife, which was unveiled in 2024.[188]
In November 2025, [[Wired|WIRED]] published an investigation of complaints from neighbors about a school that was operating on the Zuckerberg property without a permit.[189]
