Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin[a][b] (1 June 1961 – 23 August 2023) was a Russian mercenary leader, rebel commander, and [[Russian oligarchs|oligarch]].[5] He led the [[Wagner Group]], a [[Private military company|private military company]], and was a close confidant of Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] until launching [[Wagner Group rebellion|a rebellion]] in June 2023.[6] Prigozhin was sometimes referred to as "Putin's chef" because he owned restaurants and catering businesses that provided services to the [[Kremlin]].[7] Once a convict in the [[Soviet Union]],[8] Prigozhin controlled a network of influential companies whose operations, according to a 2020 investigation, were "tightly integrated with [[Ministry of Defence|Russia's Defence Ministry]] and its intelligence arm, the [[GRU]]".[9]
In 2014, Prigozhin reportedly founded the Wagner Group[10][11][12] to support [[Russian separatist forces in Ukraine]].
Funded by the Russian state, it played [[Wagner Group activities in Ukraine|a significant role]] in [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's invasion of Ukraine]] and supported Russian interests [[Wagner Group activities in Syria|in Syria]] and [[Wagner Group activities in Africa|in Africa]].
In November 2022, Prigozhin acknowledged his companies' interference in [[United States]] elections.[13] In February 2023, he confirmed that he was the founder and long-time manager of the [[Internet Research Agency]], a Russian company running [[Internet manipulation|online propaganda and disinformation campaigns]].
Prigozhin's companies and associates, and formerly Prigozhin himself, are subject to economic [[International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War|sanctions]] and [[Criminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigation|criminal charges]] in the United States[14] and the United Kingdom.[15] In October 2020, the [[European Union]] (EU) imposed sanctions against Prigozhin for his financing of the Wagner Group's activities in [[Libya]].
In April 2022, the EU imposed further sanctions on him for his role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[16] The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to Prigozhin's arrest.[17][18]
Prigozhin [[Wagner Group–Ministry of Defense conflict|openly criticized]] the Russian Defense Ministry for corruption and mishandling the war against Ukraine.
Eventually, he said the reasons they gave for invading [[Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine|were lies]].[19] On 23 June 2023, he launched a rebellion against the Russian military leadership.
Wagner forces captured [[Rostov-on-Don]] and advanced toward Moscow.[20] The rebellion was called off the following day, and the criminal charges against Prigozhin were dropped after he agreed to relocate his forces to [[Belarus]].[21] On 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the rebellion,[22] Prigozhin was killed along with nine other people when [[2023 Wagner Group plane crash|a business jet crashed]] in [[Tver Oblast]], north of Moscow.[23] [[The Wall Street Journal]] cited sources within the US government as saying that the crash was likely caused by a bomb on board or "some other form of sabotage".[24][25] Since then, researchers and other analysts have reached the conclusion that an on-board bomb or explosive likely downed the plane.[26][27][28][29]
Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin was born an only child on 1 June 1961 in Leningrad, [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia).[30][31][32] His mother, Violetta Kirovna Prigozhina, was a hospital [[Nurse|nurse]].[30][33] His father, Viktor Yevgenyevich Prigozhin, was a mining [[Engineer|engineer]] who died when Yevgeny was nine.[33][34] His grandfather, Yevgeny Ilyich Prigozhin, was a captain in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], who fought in the [[Battles of Rzhev]] and received a medal [[Medal "For Courage"|"For Courage"]].[35][36] Prigozhin sponsored the 2020 war film Rzhev [ru], based on a 1991 novel by Vyacheslav Kondratyev [ru] that mentions his grandfather.[37]
His father and stepfather are believed to be of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jewish descent]].[38] Prigozhin's great-uncle was Soviet scientist Yefim Ilyich Prigozhin [ru].[39] He settled with Yefim for several years during his childhood in the Ukrainian city of [[Zhovti Vody]], where he worked in an open-pit [[Uranium mine|uranium mine]].[40][39]
His stepfather, Samuil Fridmanovich Zharkoi, was a ski instructor and introduced Prigozhin to [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiing]].[41][42] Aspiring to be a professional skier, he graduated from Leningrad Sports Boarding School No. 62 [ru] in 1977.[43][30] However, he abandoned his sports career after an injury.[33][44] He later worked as a [[Fitness trainer|fitness trainer]] at a children's sports school.[33]
In 1979, 18-year-old Prigozhin was caught stealing and was given a [[Suspended sentence|suspended sentence]] of two years and six months in prison.
He served his sentence working at a [[Chemical plant|chemical plant]] in [[Veliky Novgorod]].[45][46]
In 1980, he returned to Leningrad and joined a gang.[33][45] He participated in a burglary spree in Leningrad, before being caught after choking a woman on the street during a robbery, with him and accomplices then stealing the woman's earrings and boots.[45][47] In 1981, he was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment in a high-security [[Penal colony|penal colony]] for robbery, theft, fraud, and involving minors in criminal activity.[47][43]
According to Prigozhin, he violated the terms of his [[Solitary confinement|solitary confinement]] "on a regular basis" until he was sent to general population in 1985, where he started to "read intensively" and worked as a [[Lathe|lathe]] operator, tractor driver, and cabinet maker after receiving training at a [[Vocational school|vocational school]].[33] In 1988, the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] reduced his sentence to ten years on good behavior, noting that he had begun "corrective behavior".[42][33] He was sent to a medium-security penal colony and was released in 1990.[42]
In total, Prigozhin spent nine years in detention.[8][32] Immediately after his release, he started attending the [[Saint Petersburg State Chemical Pharmaceutical University|Leningrad Chemical and Pharmaceutical Institute]] to get a pharmaceutical degree, but failed to complete his studies.[34][48] Prigozhin would later flaunt his prison past to convince prisoners to join the [[Wagner Group]].[49]
After his release from prison in 1990, Prigozhin began selling [[Hot dog|hot dogs]] alongside his mother and stepfather at the [[Apraksin Dvor]] open-air market in Leningrad.[43] Soon, according to a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview with him, "the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them".[50]
[[Novaya Gazeta]] notes that this may be when Prigozhin met Vladimir Putin for the first time, as Putin had been chairman of the supervisory board for casinos and gambling since 1991.[7][c]
Inspired by waterfront restaurants on the [[Seine]] in Paris, Prigozhin and Ziminov created the restaurant by spending US$400,000 to remodel a rusting boat on the [[Vyatka River]].[43][50] He said his patrons "wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka".[50] Before Prigozhin decided to focus on upscale dining, one of his dining establishments initially featured a striptease show.[64][65] Prigozhin was reportedly known to punish poor performance or misconduct of employees of his catering businesses with physical violence.[66]
In 2001, Prigozhin personally served food to Vladimir Putin and French president [[Jacques Chirac]] when they dined at New Island.
Notably, one of Prigozhin's companies, [[Concord Catering]], began winning numerous government contracts.
Some of the profits from this contract are alleged to have been used to start and fund the [[Internet Research Agency]].[69]
By this point he owned a private jet and a 115-foot (35 m) yacht.[68] Prigozhin was later linked to several aircraft, including two [[Cessna 182|Cessna 182s]] as well as [[Embraer Legacy 600]], [[British Aerospace 125]], and [[Hawker 800XP]] jets.[71]
The [[Anti-Corruption Foundation]] accused Prigozhin of corrupt business practices.
In 2017, they estimated his illegal wealth to be worth more than one billion rubles.[72] [[Alexei Navalny]] alleged that Prigozhin was linked to a company called Moskovsky Shkolnik (Moscow Schoolboy) that had supplied poor-quality food to Moscow schools, which had caused a 2019 [[Dysentery|dysentery]] outbreak.[73][74] Prigozhin was declared the 2022 Corrupt Person of the Year by the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]].[75]
The [[Wagner Group]] is a Russian state-funded[76] [[Private military company|private military company]] (PMC) formed in 2014.
It initially supported [[Russian separatist forces in Ukraine]] during the [[Donbas War]], and later played a significant role in Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
It has also supported regimes friendly with Putin's Russia [[Wagner Group activities in Syria|in the Middle East]] and [[Wagner Group activities in Africa|in Africa]].
Prigozhin repeatedly denied links to the Wagner Group, but during the 2022 Russian invasion he travelled to Ukraine to oversee the group's progress and was pictured at the frontline wearing [[Combat uniform|military fatigues]] alongside [[State Duma|Russian Duma]] member [[Vitaly Milonov]].[77] In September 2022 he said that he had founded Wagner in 2014 to "protect the Russians" when "the [[Accusations of genocide in Donbas|genocide]] of the Russian population of Donbas began".[11][10][12] He explained that he played a personal role from the start, claiming that he "found specialists who could help" after "[cleaning] the old weapons and [sorting out] the bulletproof vests" himself.
The Wagner Group was founded to support Russian interests in Africa and other parts of the world, allowing the Russian government to have [[Plausible deniability|plausible deniability]] for military operations abroad.[79][80] The plan was pushed forward by [[Valery Gerasimov]], who took over as [[Chief of the General Staff]] in 2012.
[[Dmitry Utkin]], a Russian military veteran, was also named as a founder and commander of Wagner.
During the initial stages, the [[Russian Ground Forces]] suffered significant casualties, but the announcement of [[2022 Russian mobilization|mobilization]] for reservists was delayed by Putin.
Additionally, starting in the summer of 2022, he gained the authority to [[Russian penal military units|recruit inmates from Russian prisons into the Wagner Group]] in exchange for their freedom.[85] Western intelligence estimated that the number of Wagner mercenaries increased from "several thousand" fighters around 2017–2018 to approximately 50,000 fighters by December 2022, with the majority comprising criminal convicts recruited from prisons.[85]
On 13 November 2022, Wagner Group released a video depicting its mercenaries using a sledgehammer to execute [[Murder of Yevgeny Nuzhin|Yevgeny Nuzhin]], a deserter who had reportedly been returned to the Russians in a prisoner exchange.[86] Prigozhin commented, "It seems to me that this film should be called: 'a dog dies a dog's death'" and "It was an excellent directional piece of work, watched in one breath.
On 4 May 2023, Prigozhin cautioned against the use of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] in response to the [[2023 Kremlin drone attack]], saying that "We look like clowns threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to a child's drone".[87]
Dissatisfaction arose within the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]], leading to [[Wagner Group–Ministry of Defense conflict|heavy squabbles between Wagner leadership and Russian high command]].[88]
On 1 October 2022, during Ukraine's [[2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive|Kharkiv counteroffensive]], which expelled Russia from most of the region, Prigozhin said about the commanders of the Russian army that "All these bastards ought to be sent to the front barefoot with just a submachine gun".[90] He called members of the Putin-controlled [[Federal Assembly|Russian parliament]] "useless" and said that the "deputies should go to the front", adding that "Those people who have been talking from tribunes for years need to start doing something".[91] The Washington Post reported that Prigozhin was one of the few people who dared to tell Putin about the "mistakes" of Russian military commanders in the war in Ukraine.[92]
One of the former Wagner fighters, in an interview with the [[BBC]] said: "I think it's a conflict between the Defense Ministry and Prigozhin.
And it is escalating."[citation needed] Putin's press secretary [[Dmitry Peskov]] said that the conflict between Prigozhin and the Russian Ministry of Defense exists only in the [[Information warfare|information field]].[citation needed]
Family members of Russian Defense Minister [[Sergei Shoigu]] became an object of mockery by Yevgeny Prigozhin.[97] On 20 February 2023, in his address to the Ministry of Defense, Prigozhin said, "I am not poking you in the nose with the fact that you sit down to breakfast, lunch and dinner from gold dishes, and send your daughters, granddaughters and dogs on vacation in [[Dubai]].
I'm just asking – give me ammunition!".[98] In May 2023, Prigozhin spoke out again about the Shoigu family: "Shoigu's son-in-law walks around shaking his buttocks, meaning his buttocks, and his daughter opens the [[Kronstadt]] forts.
And when the Minister of Defense shakes his little daughter and shakes some motherfucker who's a blogger, and also bends his fingers that he doesn't like the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|special operation]]...
We didn't come up with this special operation, but we took a visor and said: "If we went to fuck with our neighbors, we should fuck all the way".[99] Prigozhin condemned the [[Kleptocracy|luxurious lifestyle]] of the children of Russia's top officials and in particular singled out Shoigu's son-in-law Alexey Stolyarov [ru] for not joining the Russian army.
On 5 May 2023, Prigozhin announced that, due to a lack of ammunition, his fighters would leave Bakhmut on 10 May 2023 and hand over their positions to units of the [[Russian Defense Ministry]] if they did not receive more ammunition.[101] Prigozhin published a video in which he shouted with a face distorted with anger against the bodies of the murdered Wagnerites: "Now listen to me, bitches, these are somebody's fathers and somebody's sons.
Look at them, bitches".[102] Prigozhin said to the Russian military commanders: "You sit in expensive clubs, your children enjoy life, you make videos on [[YouTube]].
On 6 May, Prigozhin, in his next address, revealed for the first time publicly that he was banned from [[Russian penal military units|recruiting mercenaries among inmates]], although information about this appeared as early as February 2023.
According to Prigozhin, the Russian military department also stopped issuing awards to dead fighters of his PMCs, and did not allow Wagner to use special communications and transport aircraft.[96] Prigozhin accused the head of the Russian General Staff [[Valery Gerasimov]] of allegedly ordering him to give 10% of the required number of shells.
Prigozhin said: "If there is no ammunition, then we will leave the position and ask the question – who is cheating on the motherland after all?".[96] In a video published shortly before the start of the [[2023 Moscow Victory Day Parade|Victory Parade in Moscow]], he berated the Russian military command and added: "The happy grandpa thinks he's happy.
But what is the country to do if suddenly it turns out that grandpa is a complete asshole?".[103][104] According to [[Meduza]], the [[Kremlin]] negatively reacted to Prigozhin's words about "grandpa".
"Of course, he can then say that this is about Shoigu or about an abstract layman, but people draw understandable conclusions".[105] Since the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian war, "[[Grandpa in his bunker]]" has become an insulting nickname for [[Vladimir Putin]], implying incompetence and irrationality.
He said that the Ministry of Defense was more focused on internal power struggles and "intrigues" than actually fighting.[106] The Ukrainians themselves later supported this account, with their [[3rd Separate Assault Brigade]] stating on Telegram that the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade had "escaped" from the city and the remaining troops had suffered very high casualties.[107][108]
In addition to his rhetoric against the Ministry of Defense, Prigozhin also had a conflict with the leadership of the [[Chechen Republic]], and personally with its [[Head of the Chechen Republic|Head]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]].[109]
By June 2023, Prigozhin was aiming for the image of the "people's hero of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Special Military Operation]]".
According to Russian sociologists and political scientists, Prigozhin increased his visibility "through a combination of aggressive marketing and specific achievements," in particular the [[Battle of Bakhmut|capture of Bakhmut]], and since [[Bakhmut]] was the only major capture of the Russian army in many months, "the public could not ignore such an achievement".[citation needed]
In a May survey conducted by the [[Levada Center]], respondents were asked to identify the politicians they trusted the most, and for the first time, Prigozhin emerged as one of the top ten names on the list, marking a notable shift in his public perception from non-political to a political figure.[110]
The Dutch political scientist [[Cas Mudde]] described Prigozhin's "program" as a radical [[Populism|populist]] movement.
Prigozhin has been described as being member of the "[[Angry patriots|war party]]" within Russia's leadership, a group of hardliners in support of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], but critical of what they see as ineffective or incompetent prosecution of the war by the Russian government.[113]
However, Prigozhin declined to sign the agreement, alleging incompetence on the part of Shoigu.[114][115][116] Reports from the independent Russian news outlet [[Meduza]] indicated that this development would undermine Prigozhin's hold over Wagner and jeopardize the group's profitable operations in Africa.[117] Prigozhin unsuccessfully attempted to circumvent the order for Wagner's subordination while intensifying his criticism of the Ministry of Defence.[118]
In a video released on 23 June 2023, Prigozhin claimed that the government's justifications for invading Ukraine were based on falsehoods, and that the invasion was designed to further the interests of the Ministry of Defence and [[Russian oligarchs]].[120] He accused the Ministry of Defence of attempting to deceive the public and President Vladimir Putin by portraying Ukraine as an aggressive and hostile adversary which, in collaboration with NATO, was plotting an attack on Russian interests.
Specifically, he denied that any Ukrainian escalation took place prior to 24 February 2022, which was one of the central points of Russian justification for the war.[121] Prigozhin alleged that Shoigu and the "oligarchic clan" had personal motives for initiating the war.[122] Furthermore, he asserted that the Russian military command intentionally concealed the true number of [[Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War|soldiers killed in Ukraine]], with casualties reaching up to 1,000 on certain days.[123]
During the early morning of 24 June, Wagner forces crossed into Russia's [[Rostov Oblast]] from Luhansk, encountering no apparent opposition.
In response, criminal charges were filed against Prigozhin by the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) for [[Wagner Group mutiny|inciting an armed rebellion]].[124] PMC Wagner proceeded to capture the Russian city of [[Rostov-on-Don]], and began an advance on Moscow.[125] During the scuffle, Wagner shot down an [[Ilyushin Il-18#Variants|Ilyushin Il-22M]] airborne command post plane and several military helicopters.[126]
Final negotiations were reportedly conducted by [[Anton Vaino]], the chief of staff, [[Nikolai Patrushev]], the secretary of the Security Council, and [[Boris Gryzlov]], the Russian ambassador to Belarus.[130] Belarusian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] reportedly spoke with Prigozhin upon Putin's request,[131] acting as a mediator to broker a settlement.
The [[BBC]] tracked Prigozhin's private jet flying from Belarus to Russia in late June.
On 28 July 2023, a confirmed sighting of Prigozhin in the aftermath of the failed mutiny emerged, showing him meeting with Freddy Mapouka, a presidential advisor in the [[Central African Republic]], and the head of the [[Cameroon|Cameroonian]] pro-Russian media outlet Afrique Média, at the Trezzini Palace hotel in Saint Petersburg during the [[2023 Russia–Africa Summit]].[139][140] Prigozhin told Afrique Média that Wagner Group was ready to increase its presence in Africa.[141]
He became involved in such countries as [[Madagascar]], the [[Central Africa Republic]] (CAR), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Senegal]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Kenya]], [[Cameroon]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Mozambique]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], [[South Sudan]], and [[South Africa]].[142][143][144][145][146][147][148] Pyotr Bychkov (Russian: Петр Александрович Бычков) is allegedly responsible for coordinating Prigozhin's "Africa expansion".[149][150][d] According to a 20 April 2018 Kommersant article, Yaroslav Ignatovsky (Russian: Ярослав Ринатович Игнатовский; born 1983, Leningrad) heads Politgen (Russian: "Политген") and is a political strategist that has coordinated the [[Internet Research Agency|trolls]]' efforts for Prigozhin in Africa.[152][153][154][155]
In March 2020, it was revealed that Prigozhin had financially assisted [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], son of the late overthrown Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], in his bid for the [[Next Libyan presidential election|next Libyan presidential election]].[156]
Prigozhin expressed his support for the [[2023 Nigerien coup d'état]], writing on [[Telegram]] "What happened in Niger is nothing other than the struggle of the people of Niger with their colonizers ...
The rest will depend on the people of [[Niger]], on how efficient they could govern."[158]
Since early 2018, the Prigozhin-associated company Lobaye Invest has mined diamonds, gold,[e] and other minerals in the prefecture of [[Lobaye]] of the [[Central African Republic]].[160][161][f] Lobaye Invest is a subsidiary of M-Finance which was founded by Prigozhin.[148][161][163][164]
Prigozhin financed and directed[165][166] a network of companies including a company called the [[Internet Research Agency]] Ltd.
(Russian: ООО «Агентство интернет-исследований»),[167] [[Concord Management and Consulting]] Company and one other related company.[5] The three companies are accused of Internet trolling and attempting to influence the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and other activity to influence political events outside Russia.
Russian journalist Andrey Soshnikov reported that Alexey Soskovets, who had participated in Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the offices of Internet Research in [[Olgino]].
In the summer of 2013, the agency won a tender for providing freight services for participants of a [[Seliger]] camp.[168]
I invented it, I created it, I managed it for a long time."[166] The admission came months after Prigozhin had admitted to [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in US elections]].[166]
Campaigns against opposition in 2013 involved [[Dmitry Bykov]] and the then head of [[RIA Novosti]], [[Svetlana Mironyuk]], while a homepage claiming to fight fake news (Gazeta O Gazetah) was used to spread fake news.[169]
In December 2016, the [[US Treasury Department]] designated Prigozhin pursuant to E.O.13661 for [[List of people sanctioned during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions]] for providing support to senior officials of the Russian Federation.[170][171][172]
In June 2017, US sanctions were imposed on one of Prigozhin's companies, [[Concord Management and Consulting]], in connection with the war in Eastern Ukraine.[84][173][174]
In February 2022, the Internet Research Agency was added to the European Union [[International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War|sanctions]] list for running disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion and "actively supporting actions which undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine".[181]
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to Prigozhin's arrest.[17][18]
In response to sanctions issued by New Zealand against 51 oligarchs and 24 Kremlin-backed officials (including Prigozhin's own children), Prigozhin went on a racist rant against [[Māori people]] in October 2022.
He called Foreign Affairs minister [[Nanaia Mahuta]] a "petuh" (Russian: петух, a Russian-language derogatory term for a [[Gay man|gay man]], literally translating as "cock"), referred to her as a man, and said that her [[Tā moko|moko kauae]] tattoo made her and Māori women look like "criminals".
On 16 February 2018, Prigozhin, the [[Internet Research Agency]], [[Concord Management and Consulting|Concord Management]], another related company, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a US [[Grand jury|grand jury]].
Prigozhin was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference with the US political and electoral processes]], including the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], and other crimes including identity theft.[184] Charges against Concord Management were dismissed [[Prejudice|with prejudice]] on 16 March 2020.[185][186]
In February 2021, Prigozhin was added to the wanted list of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).[187][188]
In February 2022, the United States imposed visa restrictions and froze assets of Prigozhin and his family, due to the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]].[189][190]
In May 2019, [[Maria Butina]] (who had earlier pled guilty to acting in the United States as an unregistered [[Foreign agent|agent of a foreign government]]; specifically the Russian Federation) appealed for help in paying her lawyer fees.[193][h] In February 2019 Valery Butin, Butina's father, told [[Izvestia]] that she owed her U.S. attorneys 40 million rubles ($US 659,000).[195][196] Through Prigozhin's Fund for the Protection of National Values, which is managed by Petr Bychkov, 5 million rubles were donated to Butina's defence lawyer costs.[149]
In 2012, she started the Crystal Spa & Lounge, a day spa located along Zhukovsky Street in Saint Petersburg, which won a third place award in 2013 for the Perfect Urban Day Spa.[197][198] She owns a wellness center in the [[Leningrad Oblast]] and a boutique hotel called the Crystal Spa & Residence which won the Perfect Spa Project award in 2013.[197][198] She owns the New Technologies SPA LLC (ООО «Новые технологии СПА») which is located at plot 1, Granichnaya street in Lakhta Park, [[Sestroretsk]], [[Kurortny District]], Saint Petersburg.[i][200][201] She is also the owner of Agat, part of the Concord group (Russian: Агат).[202]
The couple had two daughters: Polina (Полина), born 1992 and Veronika (Вероника), born 2005, and a son  [[Pavel Prigozhin|Pavel]] (Павел), born in either 1996 or 1998.[203][118][179][204] In 2004, Prigozhin published a children's [[Picture book|picture book]], with his children listed as co-authors (the book was never put on sale – Prigozhin handed out the book to friends and associates as a gift).[205] Until the invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin's children were able to move freely across the [[European Union]].
On 20 February 2022, Prigozhin's daughter Veronika took part in equestrian competitions in [[Spain]].[206]
Prigozhin's mother, Violetta Prigozhina,[207] is a former doctor and educator, and the current legal owner of [[Concord Management and Consulting LLC]] (ООО "Конкорд менеджмент и консалтинг") since 2011, Etalon LLC (ООО "Эталон") since 2010, and Credo LLC (ООО "Кредо") since 2011.[208]
All above family members [[International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War|were sanctioned]] by the [[European Union]], the United States, Ukraine, and many other countries due to Prigozhin's involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[203][118][179][209][182][210][211][212][excessive citations]
According to [[Ministry of Emergency Situations|Russia's emergency ministry]], Prigozhin died in an airplane crash on 23 August 2023.[213][214] The [[Embraer Legacy 600]] [[Business jet|business jet]] was en route from [[Moscow]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] when it crashed, killing all 10 people on board.[215] Russian state-owned media agency [[TASS]] reported that Prigozhin had been on the passenger list of the flight.[216] The passengers' deaths were officially confirmed by the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]] on 27 August, following [[DNA profiling|genetic analysis]] of the remains recovered from the wreckage.[217]
A Wagner-associated [[Telegram]] channel claimed the jet was shot down by Russian air defenses over [[Tver Oblast]].[218] This assertion was contested due to the lack of visible missile trails in the released footage.[219] According to U.S. and other Western officials, "preliminary intelligence reports led them to believe that an explosion on board likely brought down the aircraft in Russia, killing all the passengers aboard."[24]
On 29 August, Prigozhin was buried in a private ceremony at Porokhovskoe Cemetery in [[Saint Petersburg]], beside his father.[222]
On 6 September, Ukrainian [[Main Directorate of Intelligence]] reported that it had not been able to confirm with certainty the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin.[223] On 10 September, Ukrainian President [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] confirmed Prigozhin's death and cited Putin breaking the agreement with Prigozhin as a reason for refusing to enter negotiations with Russia under Putin.[224]
On 22 December 2023, [[The Wall Street Journal]] cited sources within the Western and Russian intelligence agencies as saying that the Wagner Group plane crash was orchestrated by Putin's right-hand man [[Nikolai Patrushev]].
Prigozhin received a number of Russian awards, particularly the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]] in 2022.[226][227][228] He also received Sudan's [[Order of the Republic]] in 2018[229] and [[Order of the Two Niles]] in 2020.[230]
In April 2024, a monument depicting Prigozhin and Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin was unveiled outside the Wagner Group's chapel in [[Goryachy Klyuch, Krasnodar Krai]], which also contains the largest cemetery for Wagner mercenaries.
In December 2024, a statue of Prigozhin and Utkin was unveiled in the [[Central African Republic]]; the statue showed Prigozhin wearing a [[Bulletproof vest|bulletproof vest]] and holding a [[Walkie-talkie|walkie-talkie]] next to Utkin, who holds an [[AK-47]] rifle.[232]
