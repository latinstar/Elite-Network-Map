The [[International Bell Telephone Company (IBTC)]] of Brussels, Belgium, was founded in 1879 by the [[Bell Telephone Company of Boston, Massachusetts]], a precursor to [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T)]], primarily to sell imported telephones in Europe. [[Gardiner Hubbard]], the founder of [[International Bell Telephone Company]], was influenced by the [[Belgian government]]'s financial incentives to establish the company's European headquarters in Belgium. [[International Bell Telephone Company]] evolved into a holding company, establishing its major manufacturing unit, the [[Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTMC)]], in 1882 as a joint venture with [[Western Electric Company of Chicago]]. Although [[American Bell Telephone Company]] (later [[AT&T]]) sold its direct 45% ownership of [[Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company]] to [[Western Electric Company of Chicago]] in 1890, it maintained indirect ownership of [[IBTC]]'s manufacturing arm due to its majority stake in [[Western Electric Company of Chicago]]. [[International Bell Telephone Company]] played a pivotal role in introducing the telephone to numerous European countries, establishing subsidiaries like [[Compagnie belge du téléphone Bell]] in Belgium, [[Nederlandsche Bell Telefoon Maatschappij]] in the [[Netherlands]], and [[Stockholms Bell Telefonaktiebolag]] in [[Sweden]]. [[International Bell Telephone Company]] also licensed operations in [[Switzerland]] and introduced the telephone to [[Italy]], [[Norway]], and [[Russia]]. [[Francis R. Welles]] led the overseas [[Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company]] for 30 years, assisting the growth strategy of [[International Bell Telephone Company]]. The operations of [[International Bell Telephone Company]] were significantly shaped by [[nationalistic trade policies]] in Europe, which favored local manufacturing and led to the establishment of numerous subsidiary plants. [[International Bell Telephone Company]]'s European presence was curtailed as [[European governments]] began to nationalize phone companies, with the [[Belgian government]] purchasing or allowing concessions for [[Compagnie belge du téléphone Bell]] to expire, and [[Swedish government intervention]] leading to the legislation of Bell subsidiaries out of [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]]. The [[1917 Russian Revolution]] resulted in the loss of all [[International Bell Telephone Company]]'s investments and plants in [[Russia]]. Ultimately, in 1925, following [[U.S. Government's regulatory intervention]] and anti-trust actions against [[AT&T]], [[AT&T]] president [[Walter Gifford]] divested [[International Bell Telephone Company]] and its European subsidiaries to the [[International Telephone & Telegraph Company]], ending its 46-year European presence.
