[[Francisco Partners]] gained a majority stake in the controversial spy company [[NSO Group]] in 2014, a significant investment that placed the firm directly into the network of entities associated with surveillance technology, until its sale in 2019.
The firm's strategic acquisition of [[Forcepoint]], a cybersecurity company formerly owned by defense contractor [[Raytheon Technologies]], further embeds [[Francisco Partners]] within the defense and national security technology landscape.
[[Francisco Partners]] received a minority stake investment from elite financial institutions [[Blackstone Inc.]] (via its Strategic Capital Group) and [[Goldman Sachs]] (via its Petershill program) in 2018, demonstrating its integration into powerful global financial networks.
In its pursuit of strategic influence in technology, [[Francisco Partners]] has repeatedly partnered with other major private equity firms like [[Elliott Management]] (and its affiliate [[Evergreen Coast Capital Corp.]]) and [[TPG Capital]] (and [[TPG Inc.]]), as seen in joint acquisitions such as [[SonicWall]], [[Quest Software]], [[LogMeIn]], [[Boomi]], and [[New Relic]].
The firm's historical investment in [[WatchGuard]] while simultaneously acquiring competitor [[SonicWall]] alongside [[Elliott Management]] suggests a willingness by [[Francisco Partners]] to operate outside conventional private equity norms, potentially consolidating market power within specific technology sectors.
[[Francisco Partners]]' extensive portfolio, including entities like [[MyHeritage]] (genealogy/data), [[IBM]]'s [[Watson Health]] assets (health data), and [[The Weather Company]] (data/analytics), indicates a broad strategic focus on controlling and influencing data-rich technology platforms across various sectors.
