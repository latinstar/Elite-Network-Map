The [[Manhattan Project]] was a paramount research and development program led by the [[United States]] in collaboration with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]] during [[World War II]] to produce the first nuclear weapons.

Its leadership was primarily established under [[Major General Leslie Groves]] of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] from 1942 to 1946, while physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] served as the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], which designed the bombs for the [[Manhattan Project]]. The project's Army component was designated the [[Manhattan District]], a name that eventually supplanted its official codename, [[Development of Substitute Materials]], for the entire undertaking and absorbed the earlier British [[Tube Alloys]] project.

Early foundational influence on the [[Manhattan Project]] came from the [[Einstein–Szilard letter]], drafted by [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] and signed by [[Albert Einstein]], which warned [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the potential for powerful new bombs and urged accelerated research into nuclear chain reactions.

This advocacy led to [[Roosevelt]] calling on [[Lyman Briggs]] to head the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]], an early precursor whose findings influenced the eventual approval and scope of the [[Manhattan Project]].

The [[Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)]], formed under director [[Vannevar Bush]] by [[Executive Order 8807]], subsumed the [[National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)]] and was empowered to oversee large engineering projects, including the later [[Manhattan Project]].

[[Mark Oliphant]] exerted significant scientific influence by traveling to the [[US]] in 1941 to ensure that critical findings from the British [[MAUD Committee]] reached key American physicists, notably persuading [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] to initiate uranium research that fed directly into the [[Manhattan Project]].

[[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] officially approved the atomic program after a meeting with [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Vice President Henry A. Wallace]], subsequently creating a [[Top Policy Group]] including himself, [[Wallace]], [[Bush]], [[James B. Conant]], [[Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson]], and [[General George C. Marshall]] to oversee the [[Manhattan Project]], assigning the [[Army]] control due to its experience with large-scale construction.

[[Major General Leslie Groves]], upon assuming command of the [[Manhattan Project]], immediately exercised disproportionate influence by threatening to appeal directly to the [[President]] to secure a broad [[AAA priority rating]] from [[Donald Nelson]], chairman of the [[War Production Board]], for critical project resources.

[[Groves]] further demonstrated his power by personally waiving security requirements to issue [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s clearance for the leadership of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] within the [[Manhattan Project]], despite initial concerns about his associations.

The [[Manhattan Project]]'s extensive operations included the construction and operation of fissile material production plants at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] and [[Hanford Engineer Works]], supported by dozens of facilities across [[Canada]], the [[US]], and the [[UK]].

Through [[Operation Alsos]], [[Manhattan Project]] personnel engaged in intelligence gathering in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, to assess the [[German nuclear weapon project]], highlighting an early integration of scientific and intelligence functions.

Despite stringent security measures, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the [[Manhattan Project]], compromising its operational integrity.

In the immediate postwar years, the [[Manhattan Project]] continued its influence by conducting weapons testing at [[Bikini Atoll]] as part of [[Operation Crossroads]], fostering a network of [[National Laboratories]], supporting medical research in radiology, and laying the strategic foundations for the [[Nuclear Navy]].

The [[Manhattan Project]] maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until its responsibilities were transferred to the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]] in January 1947, demonstrating its foundational role in establishing long-term nuclear governance.
