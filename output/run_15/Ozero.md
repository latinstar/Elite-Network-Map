[[Ozero]] is a [[dacha cooperative]] located in northwest Russia, primarily associated with [[Vladimir Putin]]'s [[inner circle]]. Founded on November 10, 1996, [[Ozero]]'s initial members included [[Vladimir Smirnov]] (who was also the head), [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Vladimir Yakunin]], [[Andrei Fursenko]], [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Yury Kovalchuk]], [[Viktor Myachin]], and [[Nikolay Shamalov]]. The [[Ozero]] cooperative unified the dachas of its founders, forming a gated community near [[Lake Komsomolskoye]] where [[Vladimir Putin]] had previously acquired property. A [[bank account]] linked to [[Ozero]] was established, allowing members to deposit and use funds, which later facilitated a mechanism for wealth sharing, potentially allowing [[Vladimir Putin]] to avoid direct money receipts, as analyzed by [[Karen Dawisha]]. By 2012, members of [[Ozero]] had ascended to [[top positions in Russian government and business]], indicating its role as a significant nexus for power. [[Ozero]]'s physical community purportedly receives security services from [[Rif-Security]], a firm reportedly controlled by [[Vladimir Smirnov]] (an Ozero founder) and [[Vladimir Barsukov (Kumarin)]]. Observers suggest that the [[camaraderie]] within [[Ozero]] may be a foundational root of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s power. [[Ozero]] holds its [[bank account]] at the [[Leningrad Oblast Bank]], whose financial transactions are not publicly known. Allegations of corruption involving [[Ozero]] are detailed in the independent report [[Putin. Corruption]], published by the opposition [[People's Freedom Party]].
