[[BlackRock]], the world's largest asset manager, wields significant influence through its $12.5 trillion in assets under management and is also recognized as one of the [[Big Four index fund managers]], alongside [[Fidelity]], [[Vanguard]], and [[State Street]], underscoring its concentrated power within the asset management industry. Its [[BlackRock Solutions]] division, underpinned by the [[Aladdin system]], provides critical financial risk management services and investment analytics to major financial institutions, demonstrating its systemic importance. [[BlackRock]] has been strategically engaged by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] on multiple occasions, notably to analyze and unwind toxic assets during the 2008 financial crisis and to manage corporate bond-buying programs during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], indicating its deep entanglement with government financial stability efforts. Furthermore, [[BlackRock]] was chosen to sell assets of [[Signature Bank]] and [[Silicon Valley Bank]] after the 2023 banking crisis, highlighting its recurrent role in managing financial instability. [[BlackRock]] plays a significant role in corporate governance due to its position as a top shareholder in numerous publicly traded companies, exercising [[shareholder votes]] on behalf of clients, a mechanism that the [[American Economic Liberties Project]] and politicians like [[U.S. Representatives Katie Porter]] and [[Chuy García]] view as enabling "[[common ownership]]" and reducing market competition, leading to calls for its regulation as "[[the world's largest shadow bank]]" by [[The Economist]] and [[Basler Zeitung]], and for designation as "[[too big to fail]]" by [[U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren]].

[[BlackRock]] actively promotes [[environmental, social, and governance (ESG)]] considerations in investments, a stance that has drawn both support and strong opposition, leading states like [[West Virginia]], [[Florida]], and [[Louisiana]] to divest from the firm due to its [[ESG policies]]. This [[ESG]] focus has prompted [[Larry Fink]], [[BlackRock]]'s CEO, to defend the company against accusations of promoting a "[[politically correct or progressive agenda]]" and later to cease using the term "ESG" due to its "weaponized" nature, reflecting a strategic adaptation to ideological pushback from entities like [[U.S. Republicans]]. The [[Wall Street Journal editorial board]] has criticized [[BlackRock]] for pushing the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] to mandate [[ESG]] disclosures for private companies, arguing this would harm public markets, and has also critiqued [[BlackRock]]'s offering of proxy votes to [[retail investors]] as a "false voting choice" designed by [[ESG-aligned proxy advisories]] like [[Glass Lewis]] and [[Institutional Shareholder Services]]. Despite its ESG positioning, [[BlackRock]] remains the world's largest investor in [[coal-fired power stations]] and holds more oil, gas, and thermal coal reserves than any other investment manager, demonstrating complex and potentially contradictory influence.

[[BlackRock]] has expanded its global reach and influence through key international partnerships, including a joint venture with [[Jio Financial Services (JFS)]] in [[India]] to establish [[Jio BlackRock]], and by securing approval from the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]] to operate a mutual fund business in [[China]], making it the first global asset manager to do so. Its strategic decisions include backing the inclusion of [[mainland Chinese shares]] in [[MSCI's global index]] and increasing investment in [[China]] while lowering it in [[India]], though maintaining an [[India Fund]] for local startups such as [[Byju's]], [[Paytm]], and [[Pine Labs]]. [[BlackRock]] also engaged with [[Volodymyr Zelensky]], President of [[Ukraine]], to coordinate a role in [[Ukraine]]'s reconstruction, a high-level political connection, although later pausing efforts for a recovery fund amid uncertainty. In a move reflecting its commitment to green initiatives, [[BlackRock]] signed an agreement with [[New Zealand]] to establish a NZ$2 billion investment fund for renewable energy projects.

[[BlackRock]]'s board appointments, such as [[Amin H. Nasser]], CEO of [[Saudi Aramco]], further extend its network to major global industries. The firm's engagement with [[digital assets]] and [[blockchain]] technology, exemplified by its filings for [[Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)]] and [[Spot Ethereum ETF]] with the [[SEC]], as well as the launch of the [[BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)]] on [[Ethereum]], positions it at the forefront of emerging financial technologies, with its [[iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)]] becoming the world's largest bitcoin fund. [[BlackRock]]'s early history links it to [[The Blackstone Group]], co-founded by [[Peter Peterson]], which provided initial funding and a significant stake, though this partnership dissolved due to internal disputes involving [[Stephen A. Schwarzman]] and [[Larry Fink]]. Other financial entities that have significantly influenced or been influenced by [[BlackRock]] through mergers, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships include [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Barclays]], which acquired a near-20% stake in [[BlackRock]] after selling its [[Barclays Global Investors (BGI)]] unit including [[iShares]], and [[PNC Financial Services]], which was [[BlackRock]]'s largest shareholder before selling its stake. In the context of [[conspiracy theories]], [[BlackRock]] is falsely accused of owning [[Dominion Voting Systems]], though it does hold a 15% ownership stake in [[Fox Corporation]].
