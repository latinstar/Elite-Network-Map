[[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924]]
He served as the superintendent of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] from its inception in 1910 to its closure in 1939, and was among the most active individuals influencing American eugenics policy, especially [[Compulsory sterilization|compulsory sterilization]] legislation.
Harry Hamilton Laughlin was born March 11, 1880, in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]].
He graduated from the First District Normal School (now [[Truman State University]]) in [[Kirksville, Missouri]].
In 1917, he earned a Doctor of Science degree from [[Princeton University]] in the field of [[Cell biology|cytology]].
This led to his correspondence with [[Charles Davenport]], an early researcher into [[Mendelian inheritance]] in the United States.
In 1910, Davenport asked Laughlin to move to [[Long Island]], [[New York]], to serve as the superintendent of his new research office.[1]
The [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) was founded at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]], by Davenport with initial support from [[Mary Williamson Averell]] (Mrs.
Harriman) and [[John Harvey Kellogg]], and later by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]].[2] Laughlin was appointed as managing director and pursued the goals of the institution, even co-writing a eugenical comedy in four acts for performance at the ERO for the amusement of field workers being trained.
Laughlin provided extensive statistical testimony to the [[United States Congress]] in support of the Johnson-Reed [[Immigration Act of 1924]].
Part of his testimony dealt with "excessive" [[Insanity|insanity]] among [[Immigrant|immigrants]] from [[Southern Europe|southern Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe|eastern Europe]].[citation needed] He also argued that most [[Jews]] were born feeble-minded.[3] Bacterial geneticist [[Herbert Spencer Jennings]], condemned Laughlin's statistics as invalid because they compared recent immigrants to more settled immigrants.[citation needed] Economist Joseph M.
Gillman criticized the statistical analysis and research methodology of Laughlin's work, arguing that there were rudimentary statistics errors, as well as [[Selection bias|selection bias]].
He was eventually appointed as an expert eugenics agent to the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization (the 1924 law applied national-origin quotas on immigrants, which stopped the large [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] influx of the early 1900s).
In 1927, the Eugenics Research Association, of which Laughlin was an officer, began a study of the heritage of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]].
Some senators were enthusiastic while others reluctantly complied, and Senator [[William Cabell Bruce]] questioned whether eugenics was even a science and refused to participate.
One of Laughlin's interests was to encourage the proliferation of [[Compulsory sterilization|compulsory sterilization]] legislation in the United States, to sterilize the "unfit" members of the population.
By 1914, twelve states had already passed sterilization laws, beginning with [[Indiana]] in 1907 and [[Connecticut]] in 1909.
However, the laws were not employed with significant vigor, with the exception of [[California]].
As a result, Laughlin drafted the [[Model Eugenical Sterilization Law]], a [[Model act|model act]] for compulsory sterilization, intended to obviate these difficulties.
An additional eighteen states passed laws based on Laughlin's model, including [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924|Virginia in 1924]].
The first person ordered sterilized in Virginia under the new law was [[Carrie Buck]], on the grounds that she was a "probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring."[5] A lawsuit ensued and Laughlin, who had never met Buck, gave a deposition endorsing her suitability for sterilization, calling the family members of Buck "the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South".
The state won the case, which was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1927.
Laughlin also supported the passage of Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act]], which outlawed [[Miscegenation|miscegenation]].
The [[Reichstag]] of [[Nazi Germany]] passed the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] in 1933, closely based on Laughlin's model.[6] Between 35,000 and 80,000 persons were sterilized in the first full year alone (it is now known that over 350,000 persons were sterilized).
Laughlin was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1936 for his work on behalf of the "science of [[Racial hygiene|racial cleansing]]."[7] However, reports about the extensive use of compulsory sterilization in Germany began to appear in US newspapers.
By the end of the decade, eugenics had become associated with [[Nazism]] and poor science.
Support for groups like the [[American Eugenics Society]] began to fade.
In 1935, a review panel convened by the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] concluded that the ERO's research did not have scientific merit.
Laughlin was a founding member of the [[Pioneer Fund]], and was its first president, serving from 1937 to 1941.
The Pioneer Fund was created by [[Wickliffe Draper]] in order to promote the "betterment of the race" through eugenics.
Laughlin lobbied to keep immigration barriers enforced during the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], preventing Jews from reaching safety in the United States.[3] A biographer has described Laughlin as "among the most racist and anti-Semitic of early twentieth-century eugenicists."[8]
The world government model that he devised was loosely based on the [[U.S. Constitution]] and the [[League of Nations]].
House]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s foreign policy adviser.[9]
Laughlin was pressured into retirement by [[Vannevar Bush]] in 1939, after a series of severe seizures.[10] These seizures may have been due to hereditary [[Epilepsy|epilepsy]].[11] After his retirement from the Eugenics Record Office, the couple returned to Kirksville in December 1939.
