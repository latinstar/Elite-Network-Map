[[Bernard Spitzer]] was a significant financial backer for his son, former New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], providing a $5 million loan for his first two political campaigns and an annual payment of $200,000, indicating a direct financial influence on his son's political career. The [[Bernard and Anne Spitzer Charitable Trust]], co-founded by or named after him, donated at least $140,000 to organizations led by "political allies," suggesting a philanthropic channel for exerting influence within political circles. [[Bernard Spitzer]] was accused by Republican strategist [[Roger Stone]] of involvement in "shady campaign loans" during the "Troopergate" scandal, connecting him to alleged controversial financial practices aimed at influencing political outcomes involving his son, [[Eliot Spitzer]], and Majority Leader [[Joseph Bruno]]. His long-standing membership in the [[Harmonie Club]], an "all-white, mostly Jewish" organization, reveals [[Bernard Spitzer]]'s participation in an elite social network, which became publicly relevant when his son, [[Eliot Spitzer]], appointed fellow club member [[Dale Hemmerdinger]] to a prominent state position.
