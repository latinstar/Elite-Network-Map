[[Stand Together]] is an American philanthropic organization established in 2003, which is informally known as the [[Koch Network]]. [[Charles Koch]] founded [[Stand Together]] to assist philanthropic activities, signaling a shift away from partisan politics, an approach that distinguishes him from his brother [[David Koch]]. [[Brian Hooks]] serves as the founding CEO and current chairman of [[Stand Together]], with [[Evan Feinberg]], [[Amy Pelletier]], and [[Kevin Lavelle]] also holding leadership roles within the organization. Formerly known as [[The Seminar Network]], [[Stand Together]] was rebranded from this prior iteration in 2019 and is also known as the [[Stand Together Foundation]]. [[Stand Together]] focuses on identifying and mentoring organizations that address societal challenges by working through "key institutions of society" like education, business, communities, and government. While [[Charles Koch]] aims for non-partisan solutions through [[Stand Together]], the broader community within [[Stand Together]] still engages in policy and politics, intending to endorse policies and candidates across party lines. [[Brian Hooks]], a prominent leader within [[Stand Together]], concurrently serves as president of the [[Charles Koch Foundation]]. [[Stand Together]] exerted significant influence by leading a broad bipartisan coalition to pass the [[First Step Act]] on criminal justice reform in 2018 during the [[Trump administration]]. This coalition, spearheaded by [[Stand Together]], included diverse parties such as [[Van Jones]], the [[ACLU]], [[Senate Republicans]], and [[The Heritage Foundation]]. [[Stand Together]] continues to apply this bipartisan coalition-building approach to bridge divides on issues like foreign policy and immigration, demonstrating its strategic influence across various policy domains.
