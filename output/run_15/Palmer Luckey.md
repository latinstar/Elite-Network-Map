[[Palmer Luckey]], founder of [[Oculus VR]], built significant wealth through its acquisition by [[Facebook]], which later resulted in his controversial departure due to his political activities. Luckey's support for [[Donald Trump]] included donating to [[Nimble America]], a pro-[[Donald Trump]] group that ran a billboard against [[Hillary Clinton]], and offering to match contributions from [[r/The_Donald]] users, actions which caused tension at [[Facebook]]. Despite [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Andrew Bosworth]] (CTO of [[Meta]]) denying political motives, internal [[Facebook]] emails suggested executives pressured Luckey to support libertarian candidate [[Gary Johnson]], leading Luckey to negotiate a significant payout from [[Facebook]] citing California law. Following his exit, [[Palmer Luckey]] founded [[Anduril Industries]], a military technology company that has established a powerful network with the [[US government]], securing contracts worth hundreds of millions and billions of dollars with entities like the [[U.S. Air Force]] for [[Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS)]] and the [[United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM)]]. [[Palmer Luckey]] co-founded [[Anduril Industries]] with former [[Palantir Technologies]] executives [[Matt Grimm]], [[Trae Stephens]], and [[Brian Schimpf]], highlighting a shared background and influential ideology in defense tech. A self-described "radical Zionist," [[Palmer Luckey]] explicitly intends for [[Israel]] to utilize [[Anduril Industries]]' automated defense systems, demonstrating his ideological commitment and strategic vision for his company's technology. Beyond his company, [[Palmer Luckey]] is a prominent fundraiser for the [[Republican Party]] and [[Donald Trump]], co-hosting high-ticket fundraisers with individuals like [[John Word]] and donating to numerous [[Republican political candidates]], [[U.S. Senators]], members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and conservative organizations such as the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]], the [[2017 Presidential Inaugural Committee]], and [[Mike Pence]]'s [[Great America Committee]]. [[Palmer Luckey]]'s familial network extends to his sister, [[Ginger Luckey]], who is married to former U.S. representative [[Matt Gaetz]], further embedding him within a controversial political sphere. In a thought-provoking display of technological exploration, Luckey created a [[VR headset]] designed to kill its user upon in-game death, which he described as "office art" and a reminder of unexplored avenues in game design, indicating his boundary-pushing approach to technology's implications.
