On July 21, 2024, [[Joe Biden]], the 46th [[President of the United States|president of the United States]], announced his withdrawal from the [[2024 United States presidential election]].
Biden, a [[Democratic Party|Democrat]] who had been elected president in 2020, stated on April 25, 2023 that he would [[Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign|run for re-election]] in 2024 with incumbent Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] as his running mate.
Biden went on to win an overwhelming majority of delegates in the [[2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], where he easily defeated challengers such as [[US Representative|Representative]] [[Dean Phillips]] and became the party's presumptive nominee.
[[Age and health concerns about Joe Biden|Concerns about Biden's age and health]] had emerged during his presidency.
These concerns increased following [[2024 Joe Biden–Donald Trump presidential debate|the June 2024 presidential debate]] between Biden and [[Republican Party]] candidate [[Donald Trump]].
While he insisted that he would continue his campaign, Biden subsequently faced calls from fellow Democrats and from the [[Editorial board|editorial boards]] of major news outlets to withdraw from the race.
Harris received the [[2024 Democratic National Convention|Democratic presidential nomination]] and went on to lose the 2024 election to Trump.
Historically, the only elected president to be denied their party's nomination while they were running for re-election to a second term was [[Franklin Pierce]], who was in office from 1853 through 1857.
Additionally, four other incumbent presidents, [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[Chester A.
Biden was 78 years old at [[Inauguration of Joe Biden|his inauguration]], making him the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|oldest individual to assume the presidency]].[4] Biden was also older when he assumed the office than [[Ronald Reagan]], the previous oldest, had been when leaving it.[5] [[Age and health concerns about Joe Biden|Health concerns surrounding Biden]] emerged during his presidency, primarily about his age and ability to carry out a second term.
In a report in the Journal on Active Aging, doctors noted he had an "exceptional health profile" relative to his age, and a medical assessment performed by physician [[Kevin O'Connor]] attested to his physical acuity.[6] Biden's aides dismissed age-related concerns as politically motivated attacks by Republicans.[7]
On July 28, 2022, U.S. Representative Dean Phillips became the first incumbent Democratic member of Congress to say President Biden should not run for re-election; Phillips called for "generational change," pointing to Biden's age.[8] Phillips argued during his [[Dean Phillips 2024 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]] that President Biden would be a weak general election candidate due to his age and low approval ratings.[9] In public, Phillips was ridiculed.
In February 2024, upon concluding the [[Joe Biden classified documents incident|investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents]], [[Special counsel|special counsel]] [[Robert Hur]] suggested that Biden would be able to present himself to a jury as an "elderly man with poor memory".
Phillips [[Dean Phillips 2024 presidential campaign|campaigned]] as a younger alternative to Biden, who would be a stronger opponent for Trump.[18][19][20] On March 6, 2024, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[21]
[[Politico]] described Biden's performance as follows:
The debate sent many Democrats "into a panic".[27] The resulting political turmoil within the Democratic Party was referred to as the "Biden crisis".[29][30][31] Politico's article on the debate was entitled, "Dems freak out over Biden’s debate performance: 'Biden is toast'".[28] Prior to Biden's withdrawal, the word Joever, a portmanteau of Joe and over, was used by critics and media to describe the state of Biden's campaign.[b] Though the word was first coined in a [[Meme|meme]] on [[4chan]]'s [[|/pol/]] imageboard in 2020, the word's usage in social media posts and major media stories increased significantly following the debate.[37]
Following the debate, Biden faced calls from fellow Democrats[38] and from the [[Editorial boards|editorial boards]] of major news outlets[39][40] to withdraw from the race.
On July 2, Representative [[Lloyd Doggett]] (D-TX) became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to call on Biden to drop out after the debate.
He can put the country first by putting himself aside.”[41] However, former President [[Bill Clinton]], former President [[Barack Obama]],[42]
Vice President [[Kamala Harris]],[43] Senate Democratic Leader [[Chuck Schumer]],[44] and California Gov.
[[Gavin Newsom]][45] publicly defended Biden and supported his continued candidacy.
On July 3, twenty Democratic governors met with Biden at the White House and virtually to discuss the debate's effect on his campaign.[46] Following the meeting, Governors [[Wes Moore]] of Maryland, [[Kathy Hochul]] of New York, and [[Tim Walz]] of Minnesota spoke to the press outside of the White House, with Walz specifically admitting that "Thursday night was a bad performance" and a "bad hit".[47]
Biden stated in an [[ABC News]] interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]] on July 5 that he would not end his candidacy[48] unless "the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race'".
He added, "The Lord Almighty's not coming down."[49] According to [[Politico]], "Members of Congress and top Democratic operatives" said that "the president was more energetic and forceful than he was on stage during last week's showdown with Donald Trump — but it likely won't be enough to tame the panic" concerning his campaign.[50]
On July 8, 2024, [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that Biden's team had limited his schedule, personal interactions, media appearances, interviews, and unscripted exchanges in order to minimize concerns about his age and mental acuity.[51] According to Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal report stated that Biden "was having 'good and bad days' as far back as 2021".[52]
The Biden campaign attempted to reduce the intensity of the pressure on Biden to withdraw from the race until he could be formally nominated in a virtual roll call vote prior to the [[2024 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].
In a sports analogy, this effort was described as "[[Running out the clock|running out the clock]]".[53]
At the July 2024 NATO summit, Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] as "'President Putin'".
He then corrected himself.[54][55] ([[Vladimir Putin]] is the president of Russia, with whom Ukraine was [[Russo-Ukrainian War|at war at the time]].) Later at the same event, Biden confused his running mate with his opponent.
When asked a question regarding Vice President [[Kamala Harris]], he responded, "'Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president [if I didn't] think she was not qualified to be president'".[56]
On July 17, [[ABC News]] reported that [[House Minority Leader]] [[Hakeem Jeffries]] and [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Chuck Schumer]] had met with Biden on July 12 and 13, respectively, and had expressed concerns to Biden about potential Democratic losses in Congress that could result from the continuation of his campaign.[57] Biden reportedly told Schumer that he needed another week to make a decision.[58]
Later on July 17, Biden tested positive for [[COVID-19]].[59] He experienced mild symptoms, including a cough, runny nose, and "general [[Malaise|malaise]]".[60] However, images of him looking frail exiting from [[Air Force One]] on the way to isolation at his residence in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]], fueled further speculation over his health.[61] [[The New York Times]] reported that Biden was "more receptive" to withdrawing his nomination.[62] In phone conversations, former House speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] told Biden she was pessimistic about his candidacy.[63]
[[CNN]] reported that on July 20, Biden met with advisors [[Steve Ricchetti]] and [[Mike Donilon]].
[[Gavin Newsom]] called Biden "'an extraordinary, history-making president — a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans'", adding that Biden would "'go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents'".
In contrast, Republican House Speaker [[Mike Johnson]] responded, "'If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President.
Biden's pledged delegates were released by virtue of his exit from the race.[76][77] In a survey of delegates by the [[Associated Press]] on July 22, 2024, Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after receiving pledges from more than half of the delegates.[78]
[[Jon Favreau]] of [[Pod Save America]] reported that internal polls by Biden's campaign before his withdrawal found that Trump would win 400 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] against Biden.[81][82] Former Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]] suggested that the Democrats would have fared better if Biden had withdrawn from the race sooner.[83] A [[YouGov]] poll suggested that Trump would be seven points ahead in a race with Biden (49-42%); Trump won the popular vote 49.8-48.3% against Harris.[84] To the contrary, [[Newsweek]] suggested that Biden would have appealed to more union voters and men than Harris did.[85]
In December 2024, Biden expressed regret for his decision to drop out of the race and added that he believed he could have beaten Trump.[86] In a January 2025 interview, Biden reasserted his belief that he would have won the 2024 election, but added that he doubted if he would have had the vigor to complete four more years in the White House.[87] [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported later that month that Biden's claims had caused a rift between him and Harris.[88]
Former presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] praised Biden's work as president, with Obama writing that "Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents" and that Biden "wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America".[89] Many Democrats praised Biden's decision as "selfless", such as South Carolina Congressman [[Jim Clyburn]], Obama advisor [[David Axelrod]], and Ohio Congressman [[Greg Landsman]], with Senate Majority Leader [[Chuck Schumer]] writing that Biden "once again put his country, his party, and our future first" over himself.[90] Former Secretary of State and presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] did the same and endorsed Harris.[91]
Following the announcement of Biden's withdrawal, Trump released a statement on [[Truth Social]], his social media platform, arguing that his former opponent "was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve", calling him "the worst president, by far, in the history of our nation".[92] Trump's [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign|re-election campaign]] had prepared opposition research dossiers on Kamala Harris and [[Pennsylvania]] governor [[Josh Shapiro]], who were viewed as a potential replacement ticket for Biden should he withdraw.
The campaign intended to release messaging critical of Harris at the [[2024 Republican National Convention]], but ultimately decided against it.[93]
Trump complained about Biden's withdrawal in a July 21 Truth Social post and requested that the Republican Party should be reimbursed for the money they spent campaigning against Biden.[94] Trump also compared the Democratic Party's support of replacing Biden to a "[[Coup|coup]]".[95] Trump's language of "coup" was widely imitated by other Republican politicians and strategists[96] and in an op-ed by [[Josh Hammer]], a senior editor of [[Newsweek]].[97]
[[Australia]]: Prime Minister [[Anthony Albanese]] praised Biden, saying he "has presided over an economy that has seen jobs grow, that has seen wages increase, and that has seen the transition proceed that is occurring as the world moves towards net zero.
