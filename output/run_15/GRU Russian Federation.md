[[GRU (Russian Federation)]] functions as the foreign military intelligence agency of the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]], tasked with global intelligence collection and analysis, and conducting clandestine and covert operations. Unlike other Russian intelligence agencies like the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)]], [[Federal Security Service (FSB)]], and [[Federal Protective Service (FSO)]], the director of the [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] reports to the [[Minister of Defence]] and the [[Chief of the General Staff]], underscoring its distinct position within the [[Russian military command]]. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] controls its own military intelligence service and specialized [[Spetsnaz GRU]] units, reflecting its extensive operational capabilities. Historically, a predecessor to [[GRU (Russian Federation)]], the Fourth Department, reported directly to the [[State Defense Council (GKO)]] and the [[Politburo]], demonstrating its early high-level political connections. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] was officially established by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1942, consolidating its role in Soviet intelligence. During the [[Cold War]], [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] engaged in high-profile events, including opening backchannel negotiations with the [[U.S. government]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and contributing to the [[Profumo scandal]] in Britain. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] maintained a fierce rivalry with the [[KGB]], another major Soviet intelligence organization. Following the dissolution of the [[USSR]], [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] uniquely preserved significant operational and institutional continuity among Russian intelligence services. [[President Dmitry Medvedev]] reportedly fired then-GRU head [[Valentin Korabelnikov]] in 2009 due to objections over proposed reforms, indicating presidential oversight and influence on the agency's leadership. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] played a pivotal role in [[Russia's intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014]] and the subsequent [[annexation of Crimea]], highlighting its strategic importance in contemporary political events. Under the leadership of [[Igor Sergun]] from 2011 to 2016, [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] saw a restoration of its influence, demonstrating the impact of its director. Perceived setbacks during [[Igor Korobov]]'s tenure, such as the thwarted [[2016 coup d'état attempt in Montenegro]] and the [[2018 Salisbury poisoning]], involved [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] operations targeting [[European countries]] and political stability. [[President Vladimir Putin]] has shown direct support for [[GRU (Russian Federation)]], allowing it freedom in activities and leniency regarding diplomatic and legislative scrutiny, according to a 2018 Western assessment. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] has been implicated in numerous [[cyberwarfare]] operations across the [[U.S.]], [[France]], and [[Germany]], exerting strategic influence through digital means. [[Unit 26165]] (also known as [[Fancy Bear]], [[STRONTIUM]], [[APT28]]), a cyber operations group within [[GRU (Russian Federation)]], was accused by the [[Netherlands]] of attempting the [[2018 OPCW hack]] and targeting investigations into the [[2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17)]]. [[Unit 29155]] within [[GRU (Russian Federation)]], commanded by [[Maj. Gen. Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov]], is tasked with foreign assassinations and covert activities, having been linked to events like the [[2015 poisonings of Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev]] and the [[poisoning of Russian defector Sergei Skripal]]. [[Unit 29155]] operatives were also tracked to [[Switzerland]] during other [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] units' hacks against the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] and the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)]], connecting the unit to international chemical and sports investigations. The [[FBI]], [[CISA]], and [[NSA]] concluded that cyber actors linked to [[GRU (Russian Federation)]]'s [[Unit 29155]] conducted cyber operations, including deploying [[WhisperGate malware]] against [[Ukrainian organizations]] in 2022, demonstrating its ongoing involvement in cyber espionage and sabotage. The [[Havana syndrome]], affecting [[U.S. diplomats]] and spies, was possibly linked to [[GRU (Russian Federation)]]'s [[Unit 29155]], suggesting potential covert actions against American personnel. [[Unit 35555]] is a socio-psychological research laboratory linked to [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] that supports [[Wagner]] and other [[private military companies]], indicating its role in asymmetric warfare support. [[Unit 54777]], a primary [[psychological warfare]] capability of [[GRU (Russian Federation)]], utilizes front organizations like [[InfoRos]] and the [[Institute of the Russian Diaspora]] to manipulate public opinion and support [[NGOs]] targeting Russian expatriates in Western countries. [[Unit 54777]] also focused on pro-Soviet disinformation in new republics like [[Lithuania]] and [[Chechnya]] and manipulated public opinion in preparation for conflicts in [[Georgia]], [[Donbas]], or [[Syria]], highlighting [[GRU (Russian Federation)]]'s ideological influence operations. [[Unit 74455]] (also known as [[Sandworm Team]] or [[Main Center for Technologies]]), a [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] entity, coordinated with [[WikiLeaks]] using fictitious online identities like [[DCLeaks]] and [[Guccifer 2.0]] to release politically sensitive stolen documents, seeking maximum political impact, as seen during the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]. The [[United States Department of Justice]] indicted six [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] officers from [[Unit 74455]] for multiple cyberattacks, including the [[December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack]], the [[2017 Macron e-mail leaks]], and the [[2017 NotPetya attacks]], illustrating its direct involvement in significant global cyber disruptions. [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] officers receive training at a [[Ministry of Defence military academy]], the [[Cherepovets Higher Military School of Radio Electronics]], and the [[A.F. Mozhaysky Military-Space Academy]], indicating its structured approach to developing intelligence capabilities. An [[Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz]] report revealed that a retired Austrian army colonel, [[Martin M.]], spied for [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] for years, and his handler was identified as [[Igor Egorovich Zaytsev]], a [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] officer. [[Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeev]], a [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] officer, was identified as a suspect in the [[2015 poisoning of Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev]], further linking the agency to foreign assassinations. Six [[Bulgarian nationals]] were alleged to be members of a [[GRU (Russian Federation)]] spy ring operating in [[Bulgaria]], demonstrating ongoing active influence operations in European nations.
