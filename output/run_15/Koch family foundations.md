The [[Koch family foundations]] are charitable foundations associated with the family of [[Fred C. Koch]], with the most prominent being the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] and the [[David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]], established by [[Charles Koch]] and [[David Koch]], who also own the majority of [[Koch Industries]]. These [[Koch family foundations]] have provided millions to various organizations, including libertarian and conservative [[think tanks]], supporting [[political advocacy]], efforts related to [[climate change denial]], higher education scholarships, cancer research, arts, and science. The [[Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation]], an early component of the [[Koch family foundations]], supported Kansas non-profits by funding diversity programs at [[Kansas State University]], the [[Youth Entrepreneurs]] program, the [[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]], and the [[Bill of Rights Institute]]. This foundation's environmental aid included supporting science education and donating to organizations like [[The Nature Conservancy]] for efforts such as the [[Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve]] and the creation of the [[Koch Wetlands Exhibit]]. In 2019, the [[Koch network]] restructured its philanthropic efforts to operate under [[Stand Together]], a nonprofit focused on supporting community groups. The [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]], founded by [[Charles Koch]], aimed to advance social progress through "the [[Science of Liberty]]" and funded [[Koch Scholars]] study groups at institutions such as the [[Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University]] and the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. This foundation also granted at least $230,000 over 14 years to [[Willie Soon]], a researcher at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics]] whose views on global warming are controversial, with documents obtained by [[Greenpeace]] under the [[US Freedom of Information Act]] detailing this funding. In 2011, the [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]] granted $25,000 to the [[Heartland Institute]], a prominent supporter of [[global warming deniers]]. The [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]] subsequently split in 2011 into the [[Charles Koch Institute]] and the [[Charles Koch Foundation]]. The [[Charles Koch Institute]], steered by the [[Koch family]], actively promotes bipartisan [[criminal justice reforms]] and has collaborated with the [[Obama administration]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[MacArthur Foundation]]. The [[Charles Koch Foundation]], established in 2011, focuses on grants and supporting higher education programs that examine how free societies advance human well-being, and it also supports the [[Charles Koch Institute]]'s programs, having provided grants to nearly 300 colleges and universities. In 2014, [[Koch Industries Inc.]] and the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] granted $25 million to the [[United Negro College Fund (UNCF)]], prompting protest from the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]]. A student campaign, [[UnKochMyCampus]], supported by [[Greenpeace]], [[Forecast the Facts]], and the [[American Federation of Teachers]], alleged that the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] at [[Florida State University]] stipulated final approval of hiring economics professors in exchange for donations. Between 2011 and 2018, the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] gave $300,000 to the online magazine [[Spiked]], which has published articles against those opposing the interests of the [[Koch family]]. The [[David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]], established by [[David H. Koch]], has donated nearly $200 million to various causes including science and medical research, education, and the arts, funding organizations such as the [[American Ballet Theatre]], [[New York City Ballet]], [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

The [[David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]] is a significant funder of [[Americans for Prosperity]], a libertarian/conservative [[political advocacy group]], and [[David H. Koch]] chaired the board of directors of the associated [[AFP Foundation]]. Between 2005 and 2011, the [[American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)]] received $348,858 from the [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]]. From 1986 to 1990, the [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]] and the [[David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]] jointly granted $4.8 million to [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]], a conservative political group. Both the [[Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]] and the [[David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]] were among the funders of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a non-profit, libertarian [[think tank]]. Furthermore, the [[David H.
