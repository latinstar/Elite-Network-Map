[[NSO Group]] was co-founded by [[Niv Karmi]], who leveraged his contacts from prior service in military intelligence and [[Mossad]] to market the company's tools. The research team of [[NSO Group]] is predominantly composed of former personnel from [[Israeli military intelligence]], notably [[Unit 8200]]. [[Israel]] classifies [[NSO Group]]'s Pegasus spyware as a military export, requiring government approval for its sale. [[Israel]]'s government actively utilized [[NSO Group]] as a "de facto arm of the state," considering Pegasus a "critical tool for its foreign policy" by granting licenses to countries to advance diplomatic and security ties. This strategic use by [[Israel]] included leveraging [[NSO Group]] sales as a diplomatic bargaining chip for initiatives like the [[Abraham Accords]] and to forge a united front against [[Iran]] with sales to nations such as [[Azerbaijan]], [[Morocco]], [[UAE]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Israel]] demonstrated direct control over [[NSO Group]] by blocking Pegasus sales to [[Estonia]] and [[Ukraine]] to protect its relations with [[Russia]]. Despite denials from [[NSO Group]], U.S. intelligence officials presume [[Israel]] maintains backdoor access to data obtained by Pegasus. [[NSO Group]] claims to only provide its technology to authorized government clients. Pegasus spyware from [[NSO Group]] has been implicated in targeting human rights activists and journalists, state espionage against [[Pakistan]], warrantless domestic surveillance by [[Israeli police]], and played a role in the murder of [[Jamal Khashoggi]] by agents of the [[Saudi government]]. [[NSO Group]] froze deals with [[Saudi Arabia]] following allegations of its software's role in tracking [[Jamal Khashoggi]]. Reports indicate [[NSO Group]] sold Pegasus to the government of [[Mexico]], where it was used to target journalists and human rights activists. [[NSO Group]]'s sale of surveillance technology to [[Panama]] led to an anti-corruption investigation. [[Amnesty International]] accused [[NSO Group]] of assisting [[Saudi Arabia]] in spying on its staff. [[WhatsApp]] and its parent company [[Meta Platforms]] sued [[NSO Group]] over an alleged exploit targeting 1,400 users, including human rights defenders and journalists. [[Apple]] also filed a lawsuit against [[NSO Group]] in the U.S. The [[FBI]] initially procured services from [[NSO Group]] and established a test facility for a U.S. version of Pegasus for American phones, though ultimately deciding against its domestic deployment. Other U.S. agencies, including the [[DEA]], [[Secret Service]], and [[United States Africa Command]], held discussions with [[NSO Group]] but did not proceed beyond initial stages. [[NSO Group]] has stated it was regulated by export control regimes of [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Bulgaria]], the latter two being identified by activist group [[Access Now]] as points of concern for exports via [[Circles]], a corporate affiliate of [[NSO Group]]. Initial venture capital funding for [[NSO Group]] came from [[Genesis Partners]], led by [[Eddy Shalev]]. [[Francisco Partners]], a U.S.-based private equity firm, acquired [[NSO Group]] in 2014. In 2019, [[Francisco Partners]] sold a majority stake in [[NSO Group]] back to co-founders [[Shalev Hulio]] and [[Omri Lavie]], with financial backing from the European private equity fund [[Novalpina Capital]], which specializes in controversial company investments. Control of [[NSO Group]] was later transferred to [[Berkeley Research Group (BRG)]], a California-based consultancy firm, after investors stripped [[Novalpina Capital]] of asset control. [[Shalev Hulio]], then CEO of [[NSO Group]], suggested selling products to high-risk customers, a proposal opposed by [[BRG]]. [[Omri Lavie]] reportedly regained control of [[NSO Group]] in March 2023 after legal disputes with [[Treo]], a US financial firm. In October 2025, a group of US-based investors, led by film producer [[Robert Simonds]], acquired a controlling interest in [[NSO Group]]. [[NSO Group]] operates globally under various names, including [[Q Cyber Technologies]] in [[Israel]], [[OSY Technologies]] in [[Luxembourg]], and formerly [[Westbridge]] in North America. The [[US government]] added [[NSO Group]] to its Entity List in 2021, effectively banning U.S. companies from supplying the firm due to actions "contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US." This blacklisting significantly crippled [[NSO Group]]'s operations, leading to unsuccessful attempts by [[Israel]]i officials to overturn the ban. [[L3Harris Technologies]], a U.S. military contractor, engaged in secret talks to acquire [[NSO Group]], reportedly with the "blessing and backing" of the [[U.S. government]] and U.S. intelligence, aiming to transfer Pegasus source code and zero-day vulnerabilities to [[Five Eyes]] intelligence agencies. The [[White House]] publicly condemned the proposed acquisition of [[NSO Group]] by [[L3Harris Technologies]], asserting no involvement and opposition to efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls.
