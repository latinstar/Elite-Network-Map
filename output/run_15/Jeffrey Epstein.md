[[Jeffrey Epstein]] cultivated an [[elite social circle]] and procured women and girls for sexual abuse with associates like [[Ghislaine Maxwell]], who was later convicted for her role in sex trafficking and conspiracy. His entry into the finance sector at [[Bear Stearns]] was facilitated by [[Alan Greenberg]], an executive whose children attended the [[Dalton School]] where Epstein previously taught, and he later remained close with [[Jimmy Cayne]], a future CEO of Bear Stearns. Epstein advised wealthy clients like [[Edgar Bronfman]] at Bear Stearns and subsequently founded [[J. Epstein & Company]], which evolved into [[Financial Trust Company]], strategically based in [[St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands]] for tax advantages as an offshore tax haven. He managed the wealth of billionaires such as [[Leslie Wexner]], who granted him full power of attorney, and Epstein held positions at the [[Wexner Foundation]], [[Wexner Heritage Foundation]], and [[Wexner's Property]], exploiting his association with Wexner's company [[Victoria's Secret]] to manipulate young women. Epstein also received substantial fees from [[Leon Black]] and maintained close banking relations with [[JP Morgan]] (until the bank discarded him due to internal pressure, including from general counsel [[Stephen Cutler]], despite Epstein's citing [[Bill Gates]] as a character reference) and subsequently with [[Deutsche Bank]], with transfers totaling over $1.9 billion across various financial institutions including [[Bank of New York Mellon]] and [[Bank of America]].

His financial endeavors included serving as president of [[Liquid Funding Ltd.]], a Bermuda-incorporated company 40% owned by [[Bear Stearns]], which pioneered complex debt securities rated by agencies like [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings]], and [[Moody's Investors Service]], contributing to the 2008 financial crisis; Epstein also held a 10% voting share in a [[Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage hedge fund]] that ultimately collapsed. Epstein was associated with [[Steven Hoffenberg]] at [[Towers Financial Corporation]], a Ponzi scheme, and had [[Adnan Khashoggi]], a Saudi Arabian businessman involved in the [[Iran–Contra affair]] and a defense contractor introduced by [[Douglas Leese]], as a client. Allegations of his connections to intelligence emerged when [[Alexander Acosta]], then [[US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida]], stated he was told by "[[higher government officials]]" that Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and to "leave it alone" during his controversial 2008 plea deal, implying he was "above his pay grade." Epstein himself reportedly claimed to be an [[intelligence agent]] and, according to Hoffenberg, was recruited by defense contractor [[Douglas Leese]] to work for [[British intelligence]] in the 1980s, even possessing an [[Austrian passport]] with a false name listing his residence in [[Saudi Arabia]].

Documents released by the [[House Democratic Caucus]] revealed Epstein's connections with influential figures such as [[Peter Thiel]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Larry Summers]], and [[Steve Bannon]], while his friendships with [[Prince Andrew]], [[Donald Trump]] (whose press secretary [[Karoline Leavitt]] dismissed the document release as a distraction), and [[Bill Clinton]] attracted significant controversy. Furthermore, extensive financial correspondence from [[Russian banks]] detailing $1.1 billion in transfers over his sex trafficking activities underscores his international and illicit network. Epstein's death, ruled a suicide by [[Barbara Sampson]] but disputed by [[Michael Baden]] and marked by the [[FBI]]'s release of modified CCTV footage with missing segments, remains a subject of public skepticism and conspiracy theories. He engaged with a large team of lawyers, including [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Kenneth Starr]], [[Roy Black]], and [[Jay Lefkowitz]], and partnered with [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], [[Donny Deutsch]], and [[Nelson Peltz]] in an unsuccessful bid to acquire [[New York magazine]]. Epstein was also potentially "Unnamed investor #1" for New York federal prosecutors in their criminal case against [[Cioffi]] and [[Tannen]], two managers of the failed Bear Stearns hedge fund.
