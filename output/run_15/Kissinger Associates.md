[[Kissinger Associates]] was an international geopolitical consulting firm founded and run by [[Henry Kissinger]] from 1982 until his death in 2023, advising clients on government relations, strategic partners, and investment opportunities. In 1999, [[Kissinger Associates]] expanded with [[Mack McLarty]] joining, leading to the creation of [[Kissinger McLarty Associates]], which was a corporate member of the [[Council of the Americas]], an organization established by [[David Rockefeller]]. In 2008, [[Kissinger McLarty Associates]] separated, with [[McLarty Associates]] becoming an independent firm, no longer directly part of the [[Kissinger Associates]] structure. [[Kissinger Associates]] occupied a building formerly used by [[Peter Peterson]]'s [[Blackstone Group]] and was established in 1982 with loans from [[Goldman Sachs]] and other banks. [[Kissinger Associates]] does not disclose its client list, resisting a Congressional subpoena for this information and reportedly barring clients from acknowledging their relationship, thus obscuring its network of influence. The firm has advised corporations such as [[American Express]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Daewoo]], [[Midland Bank]], [[H. J. Heinz]], [[ITT Corporation]], [[LM Ericsson]], [[Fiat]], and [[Volvo]]. [[Kissinger Associates]] is also a member of the [[U.S.–Russia Business Council]], alongside entities like [[ExxonMobil]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Pfizer]]. The [[Kissinger Associates]] affiliation of [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] required him to disclose clients when nominated by [[George H. W. Bush]] as Deputy Secretary of State. [[Henry Kissinger]] stepped down as chairman of the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]], to which he was appointed by [[George W. Bush]], due to conflicts of interest related to [[Kissinger Associates]]' undisclosed client list.
