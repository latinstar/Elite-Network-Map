[[The Analysis Corporation]] ([[TAC]]) was a national security and counterterrorism company that operated from 1990 to 2012, primarily supporting national watchlisting and counterterrorism requirements for the [[US Government]]. Founded in 1990 by [[Cecilia Hayes]], [[TAC]] established early connections to the broader defense contracting world through her prior partnership in [[Analytic Methods Inc.]] and her ownership of [[TAC Commercial Services]] and [[Nations Home Group]]. In 2004, [[TAC]] was acquired by [[SFA]], and in November 2005, [[John O. Brennan]], a 25-year veteran of the [[CIA]] and former interim director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] ([[NCTC]]), was appointed president and CEO of [[TAC]], signifying a direct link between the private security firm and high-level intelligence operatives. [[Brennan]]'s strong ties to [[TAC]] necessitated a special ethics waiver when he was appointed by [[President Barack Obama]] in 2009 as [[Homeland Security Adviser]] and [[Deputy National Security Adviser for Counterterrorism]], and later in 2013 as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] ([[CIA]]), demonstrating [[TAC]]'s proximity to the highest levels of national security decision-making and the revolving door between government and private intelligence contractors. Following [[Brennan]]'s departure, [[Alexander Drew]] led [[TAC]] until its dissolution in February 2012, when it was assimilated into [[Sotera Defense Solutions]], a company previously known as [[SFA]], [[Global Strategies Group (North America)]], and [[GTEC]]. This assimilation connected [[TAC]]'s former operations to [[GTEC]]'s [[Intelligence Solutions]] business, which is staffed by other former senior officials from the [[Intelligence Community]] and operates within nearly every entity in the [[Intelligence Community]], including the [[US Department of State]], [[Department of Homeland Security]] ([[DHS]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] ([[FBI]]), and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] ([[DIA]]). Prior to 9/11, [[TAC]] was instrumental in developing the [[US Government]]'s original [[terrorist watchlist database]], [[TIPOFF]], and later assisted in establishing the [[Terrorist Screening Center]] ([[TSC]]), [[Terrorist Threat Integration Center]] ([[TTIC]]), and its successor, the [[NCTC]], solidifying its foundational role in national counterterrorism infrastructure. [[TAC]] secured over $400 million in government contracts since 2000, serving as a key provider of intelligence analysis, watchlist development, and systems integration for customers such as the [[Department of State]], [[National Targeting Center]] ([[NTC]]), [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] ([[DIA]]), [[National Security Agency]] ([[NSA]]), [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] ([[ONI]]), [[NCTC]], [[TSC]], and [[FBI]]. A 2008 scandal involving a [[TAC contractor]] who gained unauthorized access to the passport records of then-presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] exposed the potential for sensitive data breaches and the pervasive access held by private firms operating within government intelligence operations.
