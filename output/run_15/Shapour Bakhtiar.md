[[Shapour Bakhtiar]] served as the last [[Prime Minister of Iran]] under [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], a role that led to his expulsion from the [[National Front]] due to his perceived alignment with the Shah. His family held significant political influence, with his maternal grandfather, [[Najaf-Gholi Khan Samsam ol-Saltaneh]], serving as prime minister twice, and his father, [[Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e-Fateh)]], being executed by [[Reza Shah]]. [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] was a consistent opponent of totalitarian rule, demonstrated by his participation in the [[Spanish Civil War]] for the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against [[General Francisco Franco]]'s fascists and his service with the [[French army]] and [[French Resistance]] against German occupation. He was a long-standing critic of the [[Shah's regime]], particularly after the [[British-American sponsored coup d'état]] reinstated the Shah, and he played a crucial role in opposition movements such as the [[Second National Front]] and the later [[Fourth National Front]] (reconstituted as the [[Union of National Front Forces]]), heading the [[Iran Party]] within them. As Prime Minister, [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] initiated reforms, including ordering the dissolution of [[SAVAK]], but faced immediate and strong rejection from [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], who denounced his government as illegitimate, and received limited support from [[pro-Shah loyalists]] and [[moderate pro-democratic elements]]. Following his exile in [[Paris]], [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] led the [[National Movement of Iranian Resistance]] and helped organize the [[Nojeh coup plot]] against the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] actively targeted [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], issuing a death sentence, attempting his assassination in 1980 by a team led by [[Anis Naccache]], and successfully murdering him in 1991; one convicted assassin, [[Ali Vakili Rad]], was later paroled by France and received as a hero by [[Islamic Republic officials]], while an alleged accomplice, [[Zeynalabedin Sarhadi]], was a great-nephew of then-President [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. His son, [[Guy Bakhtiar]], serves as an officer in a [[French police intelligence unit]]. [[Shapour Bakhtiar]] feared that a revolution led by [[communists]] and [[mullahs]] would destroy Iran, reflecting his ideological opposition to both groups.
