The [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) was a [[neoconservative]] [[think tank]] established in 1997 by [[William Kristol]] and [[Robert Kagan]] to promote [[American global leadership]] and a "[[Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity]]". The formation of [[PNAC]] was influenced by [[William Kristol]] and [[Robert Kagan]]'s earlier article "[[Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy]]" in [[Foreign Affairs]], which advocated for "[[benevolent global hegemony]]" and subsequently shaped [[PNAC]]'s foundational principles. A significant network of influence is evident as ten of the twenty-five signatories to [[PNAC]]'s founding statement, including [[Dick Cheney]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], later served in the [[George W. Bush Administration]]. Observers like [[Irwin Stelzer]] and [[Dave Grondin]] have suggested [[PNAC]] played a key role in shaping the [[Bush Administration]]'s foreign policy, particularly regarding the [[Iraq War]]. Core members of [[PNAC]], such as [[Richard Perle]], [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[R. James Woolsey]], [[Elliott Abrams]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Robert Zoellick]], and [[John Bolton]], signed an open letter initiated by [[PNAC]] to [[President Bill Clinton]] in 1998, advocating for the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] and asserting the [[U.S.]]'s authority to take "military steps" without needing [[UN Security Council]] unanimity. Notably, some individuals who signed [[PNAC]]'s January letter to [[President Bill Clinton]] also signed a similar letter from the bipartisan [[Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf]], indicating a broader network of individuals supporting similar foreign policy objectives. [[PNAC]] members further lobbied [[Republican]] members of the [[U.S. Congress]], specifically [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Trent Lott]], to support the [[Iraq Liberation Act of 1998]], which was enacted into law. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], [[PNAC]] directly wrote to [[President George W. Bush]] to advocate for [[regime change in Iraq]], framing it as essential for the "eradication of [[terrorism]]". In 2000, [[PNAC]] published "[[Rebuilding America's Defenses]]", primarily authored by [[Giselle Donnelly]] with [[Donald Kagan]] and [[Gary Schmitt]] as project chairmen, a report promoting the "preeminence of [[U.S. military forces]]" and controversially mentioning "advanced forms of [[biological warfare]]" as a "politically useful tool." This report also contained a passage about the need for "some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new [[Pearl Harbor]]" to accelerate military transformation, which [[John Pilger]] argued the [[Bush Administration]] capitalized on after [[September 11]]. Critics like [[Jochen Bölsche]], [[Michael Meacher]], and [[Peter Dale Scott]] viewed "[[Rebuilding America's Defenses]]" as a blueprint for [[global American hegemony]] for key [[Bush Administration]] figures. [[PNAC]] fellow [[Reuel Marc Gerecht]] explicitly articulated the organization's conviction, stating, "Only a war against [[Saddam Hussein]] will decisively restore the awe that protects American interests abroad and citizens at home." [[PNAC]] ceased operations in 2006, with former executive director [[Gary Schmitt]] suggesting its mission was accomplished, and was subsequently succeeded in 2009 by the [[Foreign Policy Initiative]], co-founded by [[William Kristol]] and [[Robert Kagan]].
