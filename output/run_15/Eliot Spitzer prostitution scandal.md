The [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]] emerged from a federal investigation into the escort agency [[Emperors Club VIP]], founded by [[Mark Brener]], an Israeli national, and [[Cecil Suwal]]. [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s involvement was uncovered through a [[United States Department of Justice]] wiretap during the investigation. The scandal's detection began when [[North Fork Bank]] reported suspicious financial transactions by [[Eliot Spitzer]] to the [[Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]], acting under the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] provisions enhanced by the [[Patriot Act]]. Subsequently, [[HSBC]] also reported transactions directed to [[QAT International, Inc.]] and [[QAT Consulting Group, Inc.]], which were identified as offshore shell companies operating as fronts for [[Emperors Club VIP]]. The [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]] initiated a probe into [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s transactions, initially fearing extortion, and later contacted the [[FBI]] to investigate potential political corruption, which ultimately linked the money transfers to [[Emperors Club VIP]]. Following reports by [[The New York Times]] and calls for his resignation from political figures like [[James Tedisco]] and [[Peter King]], [[Eliot Spitzer]] resigned as Governor of New York amidst impeachment threats. His lieutenant governor, [[David Paterson]], succeeded him as a direct result of the scandal. [[Eliot Spitzer]] had liaisons with escorts from [[Emperors Club VIP]], including [[Ashley Dupré]] (identified as "Kristen"). For one rendezvous, [[Eliot Spitzer]] used the pseudonym "George Fox," which was the name of his close friend and campaign donor, [[George Fox]]. The [[United States Department of Justice]] later decided not to prosecute [[Eliot Spitzer]] for violations of the [[Mann Act]]. The scandal also had international implications, with [[Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]], an alleged client of [[Emperors Club VIP]], stepping down from his role in the [[British Ministry of Defence]]. Years after the initial scandal, [[Eliot Spitzer]] unsuccessfully ran for New York City Comptroller, losing the [[Democratic primary]] to [[Scott Stringer]], and notably competing against [[Kristin M. Davis]], another madam from a separate prostitution scandal.
