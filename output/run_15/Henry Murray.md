[[Henry Murray]], a psychologist at [[Harvard University]], was a key figure in developing psychological assessment techniques, which were later leveraged by intelligence agencies, and also influenced academic and professional fields. His early career at [[Harvard]] included co-developing the [[Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)]] with [[Christiana Morgan]], a method for understanding subjective perception. [[Henry Murray]] also collaborated with [[Stanley Cobb]] to introduce psychoanalysis into the [[Harvard]] curriculum and laid groundwork for the [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society]]. During [[World War II]], [[Henry Murray]] became a lieutenant colonel for the [[Office of Strategic Services (OSS)]], directly integrating him into the U.S. intelligence apparatus. While at the [[OSS]], [[Henry Murray]] helped complete the "[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]" in collaboration with [[psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer]], [[Ernst Kris]], and [[Bertram D. Lewin]], a groundbreaking political psychology and offender profiling study commissioned by [[OSS]] boss [[Gen. William "Wild Bill" Donovan]]. His "situation test" for assessing potential agents was adopted by both the [[British War Officer Selection Board]] and the [[OSS]], as noted by [[James Miller]], who was in charge of [[OSS]] agent selection. Decades later, from 1959 to 1962, [[Henry Murray]] conducted "psychologically damaging and purposefully abusive experiments" on [[Harvard]] undergraduates, including [[Ted Kaczynski]], who subsequently became the domestic terrorist known as the [[Unabomber]]. Critically, some sources suggest that [[Murray's experiments]] were part of, or indemnified by, the [[United States government's research into mind control, known as the MKUltra project]], implying a potentially hidden and controversial link to intelligence operations. Furthermore, [[Henry Murray]] is said to have supervised [[Timothy Leary's]] research into psychedelic drugs at [[Harvard]] in 1960, connecting him to another controversial psychological domain.
