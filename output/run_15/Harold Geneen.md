[[Harold Geneen]], as president and CEO of [[International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. (ITT)]], transformed it into a vast multinational conglomerate, demonstrating immense corporate power and global economic reach.
Under Geneen's leadership, [[ITT]] maintained substantial investments in [[Chile]], which positioned the corporation strategically within the country's political landscape.
Geneen's [[ITT]] directly influenced Chilean politics by funneling $350,000 to [[Jorge Alessandri]], an opponent of [[Salvador Allende]], during the presidential election.
Following [[Allende]]'s victory, Geneen's [[ITT]] attempted to leverage the [[CIA]] by offering $1,000,000 to defeat [[Allende]], illustrating an effort to enlist intelligence agencies in political interference.
Declassified documents confirm that, under Geneen, [[ITT]] provided financial assistance to opponents of [[Salvador Allende]]'s government who were preparing a military coup.
As chairman of [[ITT]], Geneen recruited [[James H. Frame]] from [[IBM]] as vice-president to lead [[ITT]]'s software division, extending his internal network and corporate strategy.
After retiring from his primary roles at [[ITT]], Geneen remained active in business and on the boards of multiple educational institutes, indicating a sustained network of influence and financial activity.
