[[David Rockefeller]] was a central figure in a vast network of financial, political, and intelligence influence, stemming from his leadership of [[Chase Manhattan Corporation]] and his role within the [[Rockefeller family]]. He served in [[military intelligence]] during [[World War II]], establishing political and economic intelligence units as a "[[Ritchie Boy]]" and leveraging family and [[Standard Oil]] contacts at the [[American Embassy in Paris]]. As chairman and CEO of [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[David Rockefeller]] expanded its global reach, making it a central component of the world's financial system and establishing the first American bank branch in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Bank of China]]'s first correspondent bank in the U.S. in 1973. A 1979 study indicated that the [[Rockefeller-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank]] controlled 16 other companies, demonstrating his direct corporate influence. [[David Rockefeller]] was a lifelong [[Republican]] and co-founded [[Republicans Who Care]] in 2006 with former [[Goldman Sachs]] executives to support moderate Republican candidates, showcasing his role as an elite political donor influencing party direction. He maintained deep connections with the intelligence community, being acquainted with [[CIA director Allen Dulles]] (who used [[Rockefeller Center]] for his WWII operations, liaising with [[MI6]]), and associating with former [[CIA director Richard Helms]] and [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.]], a [[Chase Bank]] employee and former [[CIA agent]]. Furthermore, [[David Rockefeller]] was extensively briefed on covert intelligence operations by [[CIA]] division chiefs under the direction of his "friend and confidant," [[CIA director Allen Dulles]], and befriended [[William Bundy]], a pivotal [[CIA analyst]] and liaison to the [[National Security Council]]. His ideological and strategic influence was evident through his lifelong association with the [[Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)]] (joining as a director in 1949), his co-founding of the [[International Executive Service Corps]] to promote private enterprise, and his role in forming the [[Council of the Americas]] to stimulate economic integration, leading to his proposal of the "[[Western Hemisphere free trade area]]" which became the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]. [[David Rockefeller]] also helped found the elite international policy discussion group, the [[Trilateral Commission]], in 1973. He leveraged his influence by meeting with numerous foreign leaders (such as [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]) and U.S. presidents, at times acting as an unofficial emissary. In a controversial display of political operative influence, [[David Rockefeller]], alongside [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[John J. McCloy]], persuaded [[President Jimmy Carter]] to admit the [[Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], into the U.S. for treatment in 1979, which directly precipitated the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. He engaged in extensive consultation with [[Henry Kissinger]] on matters such as [[Chase Bank]]'s interests in [[Chile]] and the potential election of [[Salvador Allende]], and supported Kissinger's "opening of China" initiative for the banking opportunities it presented. [[David Rockefeller]] famously stated in his 2003 book, [[Memoirs]], that he was "proud" to be an "internationalist" conspiring with others to build a "more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will," directly acknowledging the core of accusations made by figures like [[Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald]] in "[[The Rockefeller File]]" regarding an "international plot" for global political and economic control.
