[[ITT Inc.]], formerly [[International Telephone & Telegraph]], was founded by brothers [[Hernan Behn]] and [[Colonel Sosthenes Behn]] in 1920, establishing early global influence by consolidating European telecoms into entities like [[Telefónica]] and acquiring international operations from [[Western Electric]] such as [[Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTM)]] and [[Standard Telephones and Cables (STC)]]. A critical early connection to a network of influence involved its CEO, [[Sosthenes Behn]], meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933, signaling direct engagement with controversial political leadership. Furthermore, [[ITT]] subsidiaries, notably through [[C. Lorenz AG]], owned a significant stake in [[Focke-Wulf]], a German aircraft manufacturer for the [[Luftwaffe]], and supplied radar equipment to the [[Wehrmacht]] via [[Signalbau AG, Dr. Erich F. Huth (Signalbau Huth)]], while also making alleged cash payments to [[SS leader Heinrich Himmler]], as documented in a 1946 [[Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS)]] report. Under CEO [[Harold Geneen]], [[ITT]] pursued aggressive growth, attempting to acquire the [[ABC television network]] in 1965, which was blocked by federal antitrust regulators, and later divesting assets like [[Avis Rent-a-Car]] due to a [[US Justice Department]] lawsuit related to its attempted acquisition of [[The Hartford insurance company]]. [[ITT]]'s international activities included the expropriation of its subsidiary, [[Companhia Telefônica Nacional]], by Governor [[Leonel Brizola]] in Brazil in 1962, an event some historians link to the [[federal government of the United States]]'s support for the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]]. In the United States, [[ITT]] became embroiled in a scandal involving a $400,000 pledge to the [[1972 Republican National Convention]] in [[San Diego]], with a memo from lobbyist [[Dita Beard]] suggesting a quid pro quo for a favorable [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division]] settlement, an affair investigated by [[Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski]] and linked by [[Nixon aides John Dean]] and [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]] to the [[Watergate break-in]]. Globally, [[ITT]] exerted significant political influence in Chile, owning 70% of [[CTC (Chilean Telephone Company)]], funding the right-wing newspaper [[El Mercurio]], funneling $350,000 to [[Salvador Allende]]'s opponent [[Jorge Alessandri]], and offering the [[CIA]] $1,000,000 to defeat [[Allende]], with [[U.S. Central Intelligence Agency]] documents later revealing [[ITT]] financially helped opponents prepare for a military coup against the Allende government, leading to its New York City building being bombed by the [[Weather Underground]] in 1973. More recently, in 2007, [[ITT Corporation]] was convicted of criminal violations of the [[U.S. Arms Export Control Act]] for transferring classified night vision technology and countermeasure information to engineers in countries including the [[People's Republic of China]], leading to a US$100 million fine and highlighting its engagement in strategic military technology transfers. [[ITT]]'s defense businesses were later spun off into [[Exelis]], which is now part of [[L3Harris Technologies]], continuing its indirect connection to the defense industrial base.
