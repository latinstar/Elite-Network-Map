[[AT&T Inc.]], rooted in the original [[Bell Telephone Company]] founded by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Thomas Watson]], and [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], historically wielded substantial power through its near-monopoly on [[United States]] phone service via the [[Bell System]], which was authorized by the [[Kingsbury Commitment]] until broken up by [[U.S. regulators]] in 1982 following the [[United States vs. Western Electric Company and American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] antitrust lawsuit.

[[AT&T]] demonstrates considerable political influence, ranking as the fourteenth-largest donor to [[United States federal political campaigns and committees]] from 1989 to 2019, contributing over US$84.1 million to both [[Republicans]] and [[Democrats]], and providing $250,000 to President [[George W. Bush]]'s second inauguration.

[[AT&T]] extends its ideological reach through [[Bill Leahy]], an [[AT&T]] representative, who serves on the Private Enterprise Board of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)]], a conservative organization influential in drafting state-level legislation.

Through extensive lobbying efforts, costing US$380.1 million between 1998 and 2019, [[AT&T]] actively influences policy on critical issues like broadband internet access in the [[United States]] and supported legislation such as the [[Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013]], publicly advocated by its Executive Vice President of Federal Relations, [[Tim McKone]], to reform the [[FCC]].

[[AT&T]] engaged in controversial payments totaling $600,000 to [[Essential Consultants]], a company linked to President [[Donald Trump]]'s lawyer [[Michael Cohen]], seeking guidance on its attempted [[Time Warner]] merger, tax reforms, and net neutrality policies, which subsequently drew scrutiny from the [[Special Counsel investigation]] led by [[Robert Mueller]] and the [[Democratic House Judiciary]].

Despite publicly supporting [[LGBTQ]] causes, [[AT&T]] has also donated to sponsors of anti-transgender legislation in various [[US states]], indicating a complex or contradictory political funding strategy.

[[AT&T]] has strategically expanded and divested assets, notably acquiring [[Time Warner]] (renamed [[WarnerMedia]]) in 2018, an acquisition initially challenged by Assistant Attorney General [[Makan Delrahim]] of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division]] but approved by U.S. District Court Judge [[Richard J. Leon]], before later spinning off [[WarnerMedia]] to merge with [[Discovery, Inc.]] to form [[Warner Bros. Discovery]].

[[AT&T]]'s attempted $39 billion acquisition of [[T-Mobile]] in 2011 was met with significant resistance from the [[U.S. government]] and regulatory hurdles, ultimately failing.

[[AT&T]] also acquired [[DirecTV]] in 2015, later selling significant stakes in the entity to [[TPG Capital]] in a multi-stage divestiture.

[[AT&T]]'s former subsidiary [[WarnerMedia]] sold [[Crunchyroll]] to [[Sony's Funimation]] in 2020 and [[TMZ]] to [[Fox Corporation]] in 2021 while still under AT&T's ownership or during the divestiture process.

[[AT&T]] sold its advertising and analytics division, [[Xandr]] (including [[AppNexus]]), to [[Microsoft]] in 2021.

In 2025, [[AT&T]] strengthened its physical infrastructure by announcing the purchase of [[Lumen Technologies]]' mass-market fiber business, extending its terrestrial broadband connectivity footprint.

[[AT&T]] faces significant national security implications, evidenced by its status as a victim in the 2024 [[Snowflake Inc.]] data breach that exposed customer data, prompting the [[Justice Department]] to request a delay in public disclosure due to national security concerns, and its reported targeting by the [[Chinese government]]-linked [[Salt Typhoon]] advanced persistent threat.

[[AT&T]] formed a partnership with [[Gigs]] in 2025 to enable [[U.S. tech companies]] like [[Klarna]] and [[Walmart's OnePay]] to launch their own mobile services, indicating a strategic role in facilitating mobile service proliferation.
