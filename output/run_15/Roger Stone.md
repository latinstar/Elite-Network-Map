In 2019, [[Roger Stone]] was arrested in connection with [[Robert Mueller]]'s investigation, charged with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding, and making false statements, leading to his conviction, but [[Donald Trump]] commuted his sentence and later pardoned him. Since the 1970s, [[Roger Stone]] has worked on numerous Republican campaigns, including those of [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jack Kemp]], [[Bob Dole]], [[George W.

[[Roger Stone]]'s political modus operandi, characterized by aggressive tactics, was associated with his mentor [[Roy Cohn]], who introduced [[Roger Stone]] to [[Donald Trump]] in 1979. During the 1972 [[Nixon campaign]], [[Roger Stone]] was hired by [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]] and [[Herbert Porter]] to spy on rival Democratic campaigns, even hiring [[Michael McMinoway]] to infiltrate them, and he noted Nixon's people were 'obsessed with intelligence'.

In 1975, [[Roger Stone]] helped found the [[National Conservative Political Action Committee]], a [[New Right]] organization pioneering independent political advertising. [[Roger Stone]] also managed [[Paul Manafort]]'s campaign for the presidency of the [[Young Republicans]] in 1977. In 1980, [[Roger Stone]] worked with [[Roy Cohn]] to potentially influence the [[Liberal Party of New York]] to nominate [[John B.

[[Roger Stone]] served as chief strategist for [[Thomas Kean]]'s gubernatorial campaigns in New Jersey. In the 2000 election, [[Roger Stone]] managed [[Donald Trump]]'s aborted [[Reform Party]] presidential campaign, and was accused of sabotaging the party to benefit [[George W. Bush]], later assisting [[James Baker]] with public relations during the [[Florida recount]] and taking credit for managing the [[Brooks Brothers riot]]. [[Roger Stone]] was an unpaid advisor to [[Al Sharpton]] during the 2004 Democratic primaries, with critics suggesting this was to undermine the [[Democratic Party]]. In 2007, [[Roger Stone]], then an adviser to [[Joseph Bruno]], Majority Leader of the [[New York State Senate]], was forced to resign following allegations of threatening [[Bernard Spitzer]], the father of gubernatorial candidate [[Eliot Spitzer]]. In 2008, [[Roger Stone]] founded [[Citizens United Not Timid]], an anti-[[Hillary Clinton]] 527 group. [[Roger Stone]] managed [[Kristin Davis]]'s campaign for the [[Libertarian Party]] nomination in 2010 while also advising [[Carl Paladino]], and faced a defamation lawsuit from [[Warren Redlich]] related to campaign flyers. In 2012, [[Roger Stone]] changed his affiliation to the [[Libertarian Party]] and ran a [[super PAC]] supporting [[Gary Johnson]] for president. [[Roger Stone]] also arranged for [[Donald Trump]] to praise him on [[Alex Jones]]' radio show, where he remained an informal adviser and media surrogate for [[Donald Trump]] throughout the 2016 campaign, despite having officially left it.
