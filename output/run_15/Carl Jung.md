[[Carl Jung]] established [[analytical psychology]] as a distinct ideological framework, separating from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] due to fundamental theoretical divergences concerning concepts like the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious]]. Initially, [[Sigmund Freud]] saw [[Carl Jung]] as an important heir and means to legitimize [[psychoanalysis]], securing [[Carl Jung]]'s appointment as president of the newly formed [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. [[Carl Jung]] exerted significant ideological influence, notably contributing to the formation of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] through his treatment of American businessman and politician [[Rowland Hazard]] and his conviction regarding the necessity of a "vital spiritual (or religious) experience" for recovery. [[Carl Jung]]'s professional network included his work as a research scientist and later a senior doctor at the [[Burghölzli psychiatric hospital]] under [[Eugen Bleuler]], and his studies with [[Pierre Janet]] in Paris. Furthermore, [[Carl Jung]]'s visits to the U.S. were pivotal: in 1909, he spoke at [[Clark University]]—an event planned by [[G. Stanley Hall]]—fostering connections with influential Americans and leading to his interaction with [[William James]], whose ideas on mysticism [[Carl Jung]] incorporated; he also delivered the [[Fordham University]] lectures, later published as *[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]* and *[[Symbols of Transformation]]*. [[Carl Jung]] gained substantial financial power and independence through his marriage to [[Emma Rauschenbach]], whose family owned the wealthy industrial concern [[IWC Schaffhausen]]. His early academic collaborations included publishing *[[Diagnostic Association Studies]]* with [[Franz Riklin]] and his dissertation, which was influenced by [[Théodore Flournoy]]. [[Carl Jung]] also extended his influence in the academic sphere by serving as an editor for the *[[Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research]]*.
