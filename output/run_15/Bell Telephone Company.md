The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was founded by [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], who acted as its trustee and de facto president by controlling his daughter's shares via power of attorney, exerting early organizational and financial influence. [[Thomas Sanders]] was a principal financial backer and treasurer of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], providing substantial capital for its initial research and operations. The foundational assets of the [[Bell Telephone Company]] stemmed from the [[Bell Patent Association]], centered on holding valuable patents, primarily [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s master telephone patent. The pivotal strategy of leasing rather than selling telephones, implemented by [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]] for the [[Bell Telephone Company]], was crucial for its commercial success, drawing inspiration from the business model of the [[Gordon McKay Shoe Machinery Company]]. The [[Bell Telephone Company]] expanded its corporate structure through mergers, first with the [[New England Telephone and Telegraph Company]] to form the [[National Bell Telephone Company]] and the [[International Bell Telephone Company]]. The global recognition of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s telephone at the 1876 U.S. Centennial Exposition, significantly influenced by endorsements from [[Emperor Dom Pedro II]] and [[William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]], laid a critical foundation for the future prominence of the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. [[Mabel Hubbard]]'s insistence, overcoming [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s reluctance, ensured the telephone's exhibition at the U.S. Centennial Exposition, thereby indirectly contributing to the early commercial success of the entity that would become the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. [[William Forbes]] was brought into the [[Bell Telephone Company]] (referring to its successor, [[National Bell Telephone Company]] / [[American Bell Telephone Company]]) in late 1878 as president, leading a corporate reorganization and recapitalization. [[John Elbridge Hudson]] served as counsel for the [[Bell Telephone Company]] in 1880 before becoming president of its successor, [[American Bell Telephone Company]], from 1889 to 1900, demonstrating continuity in leadership. The original [[Bell Telephone Company]] ultimately evolved into the [[American Bell Telephone Company]], which subsequently transferred its assets to its subsidiary, the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T)]], establishing [[AT&T]] as the head of the monopolistic [[Bell System]]. The entity evolving from the [[Bell Telephone Company]], specifically [[American Bell Telephone Company]], consolidated its power by acquiring a controlling interest in the [[Western Electric Company]] from [[Western Union]] by 1881. The U.S. Government's anti-monopoly interventions prevented [[Western Union]] from being absorbed by the rapidly expanding telecommunications giant that originated as the [[Bell Telephone Company]], highlighting early governmental influence on its market dominance. Later, due to U.S. Government regulatory intervention and public criticism over domestic rates, the entity that began as the [[Bell Telephone Company]] (by then [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T)]]) divested most of its international holdings, including European divisions sold to [[International Telephone & Telegraph Company (IT&T)]], while strategically retaining control of [[Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] (now [[Bell Canada]]) and [[Northern Electric]] (now [[Nortel]]).
