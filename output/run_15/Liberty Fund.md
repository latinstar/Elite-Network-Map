[[Liberty Fund]] is an American nonprofit foundation, established in 1960 by entrepreneur [[Pierre F. Goodrich]], dedicated to promoting libertarian views and "the ideal of a society of free and responsible individuals" through publishing, conferences, and educational resources.
[[Liberty Fund]]'s ideological foundation stems from its founder, [[Pierre F. Goodrich]], a wealthy figure who was a member of the neoliberal [[Mont Pelerin Society]] and an acolyte of Austrian School economist [[Ludwig von Mises]].
The financial power of [[Liberty Fund]] was significantly enhanced by an $80 million donation from [[Pierre F. Goodrich]]'s wife, [[Enid Goodrich]], in 1997, increasing its assets to over $300 million.
Historian [[Donald T. Critchlow]] identified [[Liberty Fund]] as one of the key endowed conservative foundations that strategically influenced the political landscape, contributing to the election of [[U.S. President Ronald Reagan]] in 1980.
[[Liberty Fund]] initiated its publishing program in 1971 with `Education in a Free Society`, coauthored by its founder [[Pierre F. Goodrich]] and [[Benjamin A. Rogge]], who also served as a founding director of the foundation.
Through its numerous Socratic conferences and over 400 publications, [[Liberty Fund]] expands its intellectual and ideological reach across disciplines like economics, law, political theory, and increasingly, genomics and artificial intelligence.
Notable scholars such as [[James Buchanan]], [[Gordon Tullock]], [[Geoffrey Brennan]], and [[Henry Manne]] have led significant conferences for [[Liberty Fund]], fostering intellectual contributions in fields like Public Choice Theory and Law and Economics.
Former U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]] controversially criticized [[Liberty Fund]] for hosting training seminars for judges, observing that 97% of attendees between 2002 and 2004 were [[Republican]] administration appointees.
[[Al Gore]] further alleged that [[Liberty Fund]]'s judicial conferences contribute to judges making "radical pro-corporate, antienvironmental, and activist decisions," thereby promoting a "radical right-wing agenda" through what he termed "multithousand-dollar vacations for federal judges."
[[Al Gore]] grouped [[Liberty Fund]] with other influential organizations, the [[Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment]] and [[George Mason University's Law & Economics Center]], categorizing them as a "Big Three" exerting strategic influence.
