[[Ruhollah Khomeini]] founded the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] and served as its first [[Supreme Leader]], transforming the country into a theocratic state after leading the [[Iranian Revolution]] which overthrew [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. As a high-ranking cleric in [[Twelver Shi'ism]], he formalized his religiopolitical theory of [[Guardianship of the Jurist]] (Velayat-e Faqih) in his work "[[Islamic Government]]", laying the ideological foundation for his rule despite strategically concealing it from the wider public to avoid alarming the secular middle class. His profound intellectual influences included historic [[Sufi mystics]] like [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Ibn Arabi]], and Islamic philosophers such as [[Avicenna]], shaping his unique blend of mysticism and political activism, and he taught students like [[Morteza Motahhari]] who later became leading philosophers. Early in his career, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] authored "[[Kashf al-Asrar]]" as a direct refutation of "[[Asrar-e Hezar Sale]]", a tract by a disciple of anti-clerical historian [[Ahmad Kasravi]], and condemned the banning of [[hijab]] by [[Reza Shah]]. He valued the ideals of Islamists such as [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] and [[Abol-Ghasem Kashani]], considering Noori a "heroic figure" and deriving his objections to constitutionalism from Noori's stance, and he sought guidance from [[Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris]], a leader of opposition in [[Iran's parliament]]. The deaths of [[Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi]] and [[Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani]] in the early 1960s created a leadership vacuum that [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] leveraged to rise as a prominent cleric and political force. He demonstrated political resistance through his opposition to the [[White Revolution]] of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], which led to his state-sponsored expulsion and his persuasion of senior [[Marja's of Qom]] to boycott the reform referendum. He vehemently denounced both the Shah and the [[United States]] over "capitulations," resulting in his arrest and the subsequent major public unrest known as the [[Movement of 15 Khordad]]. [[Fadayan-e Islam]], a Shia militia sympathetic to [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], assassinated [[Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur]] after Mansur confronted Khomeini, underscoring the militant support he commanded. While in exile, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] continued to exert influence, being hosted by [[Colonel Ali Cetiner]] of [[Turkish Military Intelligence]] in Bursa, later expelled from Najaf by [[Saddam Hussein]], and directing the revolution from [[Neauphle-le-Château]], France, by urging non-compromise and ordering work stoppages. [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] strategically mobilized the extensive network of [[mosques in Iran]], alongside pious faithful and Mullah leaders, effectively leveraging a political resource inaccessible to secular opponents. The death of [[Ali Shariati]], an Islamic reformist, further elevated [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] to become the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah, and his image was enhanced by an old Shia saying attributed to [[Imam Musa al-Kazim]] prophesying a man from [[Qom]] and a rumor of his face in the full moon. He forged strategic alliances with [[Islamic reformists]] and [[secular enemies of the Shah]] during the revolution, groups he later suppressed, and also allied with and funded the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] in the early 1970s. Through circulating cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] effectively demythologized the Shah's authority and fueled popular opposition. His posthumous influence is significant, being legally "inviolable" in Iran and officially known as [[Imam Khomeini]], with his gold-domed tomb in Tehran becoming a shrine for his adherents, reinforcing his enduring status as a champion of [[Islamic revival]], independence, and [[anti-imperialism]]. [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was globally recognized, appearing as [[Time magazine]]'s Man of the Year in 1979 and becoming the "virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture." His significant directives included supporting the hostage takers during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], issuing a fatwa for the murder of British Indian novelist [[Salman Rushdie]], and pursuing the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], while ideologically defining the [[United States]] as the "Great Satan" and [[Israel]] as the "Little Satan."
