[[Ted Kaczynski]], widely known as the [[Unabomber]], initiated a deadly mail bombing campaign across the United States, driven by his radical opposition to modern [[Technology]] and his advocacy for [[Cultural Primitivism]] and [[Violent Revolution]], which he expounded upon in his manifesto, "[[Industrial Society and Its Future]]". Kaczynski's extreme anti-technology ideology was profoundly influenced by [[Jacques Ellul]]'s "[[The Technological Society]]", which he regarded as his core philosophical text. The extensive investigation into Kaczynski's activities, making it the longest and most expensive in the history of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]], ultimately led to his arrest. Following Kaczynski's offer to cease terrorism if his manifesto was published, the [[FBI]] and [[U.S. attorney general Janet Reno]] endorsed its publication in both [[The Washington Post]] and [[The New York Times]]. Crucially, the public availability of Kaczynski's manifesto allowed his brother, [[David Kaczynski]], to recognize the distinctive prose and alert the [[FBI]], which directly resulted in Kaczynski's apprehension. A significant, though indirect, influence on Kaczynski's later hostility toward perceived mind control and invasion of privacy stemmed from his participation in a psychological study led by [[Harvard University]] psychologist [[Henry Murray]]. Kaczynski specifically targeted individuals and organizations he believed were advancing [[Technology]] or contributing to environmental destruction, including a professor at [[Northwestern University]] ([[Buckley Crist]]), the president of [[United Airlines]] ([[Percy Wood]]), a professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Patrick C. Fischer]]), multiple individuals at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] ([[Diogenes Angelakos]], [[John Hauser]]), a computer store owner ([[Hugh Scrutton]]), a computer store patron ([[Gary Wright]]), professors at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] ([[Charles Epstein]]) and [[Yale University]] ([[David Gelernter]]), a [[Burson-Marsteller]] executive ([[Thomas J. Mosser]]) whose work included public relations for [[Exxon]], and the president of the [[California Forestry Association]] ([[Gilbert Brent Murray]]), while also sending a threatening letter to a geneticist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] ([[Phillip Sharp]]). Kaczynski intentionally inscribed the initials "[[Freedom Club (FC)]]" on components of his bombs, signifying his ideological affiliation and intent.
