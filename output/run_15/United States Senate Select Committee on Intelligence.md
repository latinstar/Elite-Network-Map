The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (sometimes referred to as the Intelligence Committee or SSCI) is dedicated to overseeing the [[United States Intelligence Community]]—the agencies and bureaus of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government of the United States]] that provide information and analysis for leaders of the executive and legislative branches.
Eight of those seats are reserved for one majority and one minority member of each of the following committees: [[Senate Appropriations Committee|Appropriations]], [[Senate Armed Services Committee|Armed Services]], [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee|Foreign Relations]], and [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary]].[3] Of the remaining seven, four are members of the majority, and three are members of the minority.[3] In addition, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader are non-voting [[Ex officio|ex officio]] members of the committee.[3] Also, the Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services (if not already a member of the select Committee) are ex officio members.[4]
These entities include the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], [[National Reconnaissance Office]], as well as the intelligence-related components of [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].
The Committee makes recommendations to the Senate Armed Services Committee on authorizations for the intelligence-related components of the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Air Force]], and [[U.S. Marine Corps]].
The Select Committee on Intelligence was preceded by the [[Church Committee]] (1975).
On July 8, 2004, the committee issued the [[Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq|Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq]], and on June 5, 2008, it issued a long-delayed portion of its "phase two" investigative report, which compared the prewar public statements made by top Bush administration officials to justify the invasion with the intelligence information that was available to them at that time.[6]
In a March 6, 2008, letter to the Senate leadership, 14 of the 15 then members of the Committee proposed the creation of a new Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence to prepare the annual intelligence budget.[7] The proposed Subcommittee, on which members of the Intelligence Committee would be heavily represented, would increase the Committee's influence and leverage over [[Executive branch|executive branch]] intelligence agencies, and require continuing disclosure of the annual budget for the National Intelligence Program.
The proposal has been opposed by the leadership of the [[Senate Appropriations Committee]], however.[8]
In 2013, and beyond, the SSCI received renewed attention in the wake of [[Edward Snowden]]'s disclosures regarding the [[NSA]] surveillance of communications.
Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and the SSCI made several statements on the matter, one of which was notably disputed: that the [[NSA]] tracked US citizens' locations via cellphone.
Later, the SSCI Staff Director, David Grannis, claimed that the NSA did not collect cellphone location, claiming the Senator was "speaking extemporaneously".[9] The SSCI later came to prominence in relation to voting to publish in March 2014[10] and then publishing in December 2014 of a [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|report on the policies of the CIA on torture]].
In 2017, the SSCI began investigating [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], possible incriminating links between members of the Russian government and members of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential campaign team, and the security of election processes in the United States.[11] On April 21, 2020, the SSCI (chaired at the time by the Republican [[Richard Burr]]) released a much redacted report[12][13][14] with its final judgment that the intelligence community's assessment was "coherent and well-constructed"; the SSCI therefore supports the intelligence community's claim that Putin's "interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election" in favor of candidate Trump was unprecedented in its "manner and aggressiveness".
On May 14, 2020, Senator Burr, who oversaw the probe on Russian interference in the 2016 election, stepped down as SSCI chair due to an [[2020 Congressional insider trading scandal|ongoing investigation regarding insider trading]] by Senator Burr during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]].[18] Senator McConnell announced on May 18, 2020 that [[Marco Rubio]] would replace Burr temporarily.[19]
