The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] ([[MPS]]), an international academic society of economists, political philosophers, and intellectuals, was founded in 1947 with a shared classical liberal outlook and is headquartered at [[Texas Tech University]]. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] advocates for freedom of expression, free market economic policies, and an open society, further seeking ways for the private sector to replace government functions. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] was established at a conference organized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], who acknowledged discussions about the society's plan with [[Henry Simons]] and [[John Clapham]]. The founding conference of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] received funding from the [[William Volker Fund]] (via [[Harold Luhnow]]), the [[Bank of England]] (with assistance from [[Alfred Suenson-Taylor]]), the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], and the [[Schweizerische Kreditanstalt]] (now [[Credit Suisse]]), which covered 93% of the costs. [[Frank Knight]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] protested against the original intention to name the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] the [[Acton-Tocqueville Society]]. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]]'s "Statement of Aims" articulated concerns about threats to human dignity, freedom, and expression from arbitrary power and intolerant creeds, asserting that the preservation of freedom is difficult without private property and the competitive market. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] stated its aim was to facilitate the exchange of views for the preservation and improvement of a free society, explicitly avoiding orthodoxy or propaganda, though its focus notably did not traditionally embrace a full range of human and political rights. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] maintains close ties to the network of think tanks sponsored in part by the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]], now known as the [[Atlas Network]]. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] evolved to become part of an international think tank movement, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] specifically using it as a forum to encourage members like [[Antony Fisher]] to pursue establishing think tanks. An [[Mont Pelerin Society]] member, [[Antony Fisher]], notably established the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] ([[IEA]]), the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], and the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]], which as the [[Atlas Network]] supports a wide network of think tanks, including the [[Fraser Institute]]. Prominent members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] have advanced to significant policy positions, including Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] of West Germany, President [[Luigi Einaudi]] of Italy, Chairman [[Arthur F. Burns]] of the [[Federal Reserve Board]], and Secretary of State [[George Shultz]]. The [[Mont Pelerin Society]]'s contemporary political influence is demonstrated by members holding roles such as former President [[Václav Klaus]] of the Czech Republic, Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremasinghe]] of Sri Lanka, former Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]] of the United Kingdom, and former Finance Ministers like [[Carlos Cáceres]] of Chile and [[Ruth Richardson]] of New Zealand. A substantial 22 out of 76 economic advisers on [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 presidential campaign staff were members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], indicating direct policy influence. Leading journalists, including [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Max Eastman]], [[John Chamberlain]], [[Henry Hazlitt]], [[John Davenport]], and [[Felix Morley]], have also been members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], extending its reach into media and public discourse. Members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] have been well represented on the [[Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]], suggesting influence over the recognition of economic thought. Eight members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], including [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]], have won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Commentators [[Graeme Maxton]] and [[Jørgen Randers]] assert that the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] notably helped create the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] to legitimize free-market economic thinking, explaining the significant number of MPS Nobel laureates. In 2014, the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] was ranked ninth globally for "Best Think Tank Conference" by the [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], acknowledging its role in the think tank ecosystem, despite Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Paul Romer]] finding a meeting of the society "boring and depressing." The first meeting of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] occurred in the [[Hotel du Parc]] in Mont Pèlerin, Switzerland, and [[William Rappard]] addressed its inaugural meeting.
