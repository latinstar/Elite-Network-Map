[[Mithril Capital Management]] was co-founded in 2012 by influential venture capitalist [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Ajay Royan]], with [[Peter Thiel]] providing substantial initial funding and serving as chair of its investment committee while entrusting [[Ajay Royan]] with its operations.
The firm strategically invested in [[Palantir]] at [[Peter Thiel]]'s arrangement, following a competitive clash with [[Founders Fund]] over [[Airbnb]] investment opportunities.
[[Mithril Capital Management]] established financial partnerships with significant global entities, including [[Temasek]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[Sawiris family]].
Internal conflicts, concerns about the leadership style of [[Ajay Royan]], and allegations of nepotism involving his sister [[Anuja Royan]] (CFO) and father being on the payroll, led to investor dissatisfaction and staff departures from [[Mithril Capital Management]].
Former [[Mithril Capital Management]] lawyer [[Crystal McKellar]] initiated requests for investigations by the [[FBI]] and [[SEC]] into the firm, leading to an [[FBI]] inquiry before legal cases were withdrawn.
[[Mithril Capital Management]] incubated future defense and political figures, including [[Matt Grimm]], a former principal who co-founded the defense technology company [[Anduril]], joined by former investor [[Sam Ecker]].
[[JD Vance]], now a [[U.S. vice president]], worked at [[Mithril Capital Management]] before co-founding [[Narya Capital]] with former colleague [[Colin Greenspon]], a venture backed by [[Peter Thiel]], [[Marc Andreessen]], and [[Eric Schmidt]].
Conflicts with [[Ajay Royan]] also led to the departure of [[Jim O'Neill]], who was close to [[Peter Thiel]], further indicating internal power struggles within [[Mithril Capital Management]].
Despite internal turmoil and [[Peter Thiel]] being reportedly "heavily burdened by politics," his continued commitment, alongside the success of the [[Auris]] deal, provided stability to [[Mithril Capital Management]].
