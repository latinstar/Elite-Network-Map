The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA /ˌsiː.aɪˈeɪ/) is a civilian [[Intelligence agency|foreign intelligence service]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government of the United States]] tasked with advancing [[National security|national security]] through collecting and analyzing intelligence from around the world and conducting [[Covert operation|covert operations]].
The agency is headquartered in the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence]] in [[Langley, Virginia]], and is sometimes [[Metonymy|metonymously]] called "Langley".
A major member of the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC), the CIA has reported to the [[Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]] since 2004, and is focused on providing intelligence for the [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], though it also provides intelligence for a variety of other entities including the [[US Military]] and foreign allies.
The CIA is headed by [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|a director]] and is divided into various directorates, including a Directorate of Analysis and [[Directorate of Operations]].
Unlike the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the CIA has no law enforcement function and focuses on intelligence gathering overseas, with only [[National Resources Division|limited domestic intelligence collection]].[7] The CIA is responsible for coordinating all [[Human intelligence|human intelligence]] (HUMINT) activities in the IC.
The CIA exerts foreign political influence through its paramilitary operations units, including its [[Special Activities Center]].
It has also provided support to several foreign political groups and governments, including planning, coordinating, [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|training and carrying out torture]], and technical support.
It was involved in many [[United States involvement in regime change|regime changes]] and carrying out planned assassinations of foreign leaders and [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] against civilians.
During [[World War II]], U.S. intelligence and covert operations had been undertaken by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).
Truman]], who created the [[Central Intelligence Group]] in 1946.
Amid the intensifying [[Cold War]], the [[National Security Act of 1947]] established the CIA, headed by a [[Director of Central Intelligence|director of central intelligence]] (DCI).
The [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] of 1949 exempted the agency from most Congressional oversight, and during the 1950s, it became a major instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
The CIA employed [[Psychological warfare|psychological operations]] against communist regimes, and backed [[United States involvement in regime change|coups to advance American interests]].
Major CIA-backed operations include the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|1953 coup in Iran]], the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|1954 coup in Guatemala]], the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of [[Cuba]] in 1961, and the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup in Chile]].
In 1975, the [[Church Committee]] of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] revealed illegal operations such as [[MKUltra]] and [[Operation CHAOS|CHAOS]], after which greater oversight was imposed.
In the 1980s, the CIA supported the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and Nicaraguan [[Contras]], and after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, played a role in the [[War on terror|Global War on Terrorism]].
The agency has been the subject of [[List of CIA controversies|numerous controversies]], including its [[Human rights violations by the CIA|use of political assassinations]], [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|torture]], [[Project Mockingbird|domestic wiretapping]], [[CIA influence on public opinion|propaganda]], [[MKUltra|mind control techniques]], and [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|drug trafficking]], among others.
The [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] (D/CIA) is appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]] with [[Senate confirmation]] and reports directly to the [[Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]] (DNI); in practice, the CIA director interfaces with the DNI, [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the [[White House]], while the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|deputy director (DD/CIA)]] is the internal executive of the CIA and the chief operating officer (COO/CIA), known as executive director until 2017, leads the day-to-day work[9] as the third-highest post of the CIA.[10] The deputy director is formally appointed by the director without [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation,[10][11] but as the president's opinion plays a great role in the decision,[11] the deputy director is generally considered a political position, making the chief operating officer the most senior non-political position for CIA career officers.[12]
The Executive Office also supports the [[United States military|U.S. military]], including the [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]], by providing it with information it gathers, receiving information from [[Military intelligence|military intelligence]] organizations, and cooperating with field activities.
Each branch of the agency has its own director.[9] The Office of Military Affairs (OMA), subordinate to the associate deputy director, manages the relationship between the CIA and the [[Unified Combatant Command|Unified Combatant Commands]], who produce and deliver regional and operational intelligence and consume national intelligence produced by the CIA.[13]
The Directorate of Analysis, through much of its history known as the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), is tasked with helping "the President and other policymakers make informed decisions about our country's national security" by looking "at all the available information on an issue and organiz[ing] it for policymakers".[14] The directorate has four regional analytic groups, six groups for transnational issues, and three that focus on policy, collection, and staff support.[15] There are regional analytical offices covering the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]], [[Russia]], and Europe; and the [[Asia–Pacific]], [[Latin America]], and [[Africa]].
This directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy, and budget between the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) and the CIA.
In spite of this, the Department of Defense announced in 2012 its intention to organize its own global clandestine intelligence service, the [[Defense Clandestine Service]] (DCS),[16] under the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA).
Contrary to some public and [[Mass media|media]] misunderstanding, DCS is not a "new" [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agency]] but rather a consolidation, expansion and realignment of existing Defense [[Clandestine HUMINT|HUMINT]] activities, which have been carried out by DIA for decades under various names, most recently as the Defense Human Intelligence Service.[17]
The development of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, for instance, was done in cooperation with the [[United States Air Force]].
The U-2's original mission was clandestine [[IMINT|imagery intelligence]] over denied areas such as the [[Soviet Union]].[19]
The [[Langley, Virginia]]–based office's mission is to streamline and integrate digital and cybersecurity capabilities into the CIA's espionage, counterintelligence, all-source analysis, open-source intelligence collection, and covert action operations.[20] It provides operations personnel with tools and techniques to use in cyber operations.
It works with [[Information technology|information technology]] infrastructure and practices cyber [[Tradecraft|tradecraft]].[21] This means retrofitting the CIA for [[Cyberwarfare|cyberwarfare]].
They also apply technical expertise to exploit clandestine and publicly available information (also known as [[Open-source intelligence|open-source data]]) using specialized methodologies and digital tools to plan, initiate and support the technical and human-based operations of the CIA.[22] Before the establishment of the new digital directorate, offensive cyber operations were undertaken by the CIA's Information Operations Center.[23] Little is known about how the office specifically functions or if it deploys offensive cyber capabilities.[20]
[[Adam Schiff]], the California Democrat who served as the ranking member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], endorsed the reorganization.
The Office of Congressional Affairs (OCA) serves as the liaison between the CIA and the [[US Congress]].
The office is the CIA's primary interface with [[Congressional oversight]] committees, leadership, and members.
Following the end of the [[Cold War]], the CIA's training budget was slashed, which had a negative effect on [[Employee retention|employee retention]].[29][30]
In response, Director of Central Intelligence [[George Tenet]] established [[CIA University]] in 2002.[29][14] CIA University holds between 200 and 300 courses each year, training both new hires and experienced intelligence officers, as well as CIA support staff.[29][30] The facility works in partnership with the [[National Intelligence University]], and includes the [[Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis]], the Directorate of Analysis' component of the university.[14][31][32]
For later stage training of student operations officers, there is at least one classified training area at [[Camp Peary]], near [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].
Students are selected, and their progress evaluated, in ways derived from the OSS, published as the book Assessment of Men, Selection of Personnel for the Office of Strategic Services.[33] Additional mission training is conducted at [[Harvey Point]], [[North Carolina]].[34]
The primary training facility for the Office of Communications is [[Warrenton Training Center]], located near [[Warrenton, Virginia]].
Details of the overall United States intelligence budget are classified.[3] Under the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] of 1949, the Director of Central Intelligence is the only federal government employee who can spend [[Black budget|"un-vouchered" government money]].[37] The government showed its 1997 budget was $26.6 billion for the fiscal year.[38] The government has disclosed a total figure for all non-military intelligence spending since 2007; the fiscal 2013 figure is $52.6 billion.
According to the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]], the CIA's fiscal 2013 budget is $14.7 billion, 28% of the total and almost 50% more than the budget of the National Security Agency.
CIA's [[HUMINT]] budget is $2.3 billion, the [[SIGINT]] budget is $1.7 billion, and spending for security and logistics of CIA missions is $2.5 billion.
"Covert action programs," including a variety of activities such as the CIA's [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] fleet and anti-[[Iranian nuclear program]] activities, accounts for $2.6 billion.[3]
There were numerous previous attempts to obtain general information about the budget.[39] As a result, reports revealed that CIA's annual budget in Fiscal Year 1963 was $550 million (equivalent to US$5.6 billion in 2024),[40] and the overall intelligence budget in FY 1997 was US$26.6 billion (equivalent to US$52.1 billion in 2024).[41] There have been accidental disclosures; for instance, [[Mary Margaret Graham]], a former CIA official and deputy director of national intelligence for collection in 2005, said that the annual intelligence budget was $44 billion,[42] and in 1994 Congress accidentally published a budget of $43.4 billion (in 2012 dollars) in 1994 for the non-military National Intelligence Program, including $4.8 billion for the CIA.[3]
After the [[Marshall Plan]] was approved, appropriating $13.7 billion over five years, 5% of those funds or $685 million were secretly made available to the CIA.
The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the [[Federal Intelligence Service]] (BND) in [[Cabinet of Germany|Germany]], [[MI6]] in the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS) in [[Australian Government|Australia]], the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (DGSE) in [[Government of France|France]], the [[Foreign Intelligence Service]] in [[Government of Russia|Russia]], the [[Ministry of State Security]] (MSS) in [[Government of China|China]], the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) in [[Government of India|India]], the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) in [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[General Intelligence Service]] in [[Politics of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mossad]] in [[Cabinet of Israel|Israel]], and the [[National Intelligence Service]] (NIS) in [[Government of South Korea|South Korea]].
The CIA was instrumental in the establishment of intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, including Germany's BND and Greece's [[National Intelligence Service|EYP]] (then known as KYP).[44][citation needed]
A new handling caveat, USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL [[Five Eyes]], used primarily on intelligence messages, indicates that the material can be shared with Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
The task of the division called "Verbindungsstelle 61" of the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] is keeping contact to the CIA office in [[Wiesbaden]].[46]
During [[World War II]], U.S. intelligence and covert operations were undertaken by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).[47] Many future CIA officers, including four directors of Central Intelligence, served in the OSS.[48] On September 20, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, Truman signed an [[Executive order|executive order]] dissolving the OSS.[49] By October 1945 its functions had been divided between the [[United States Department of State|Departments of State]] and [[Department of War|War]].
The first public mention of the "Central Intelligence Agency" appeared on a command-restructuring proposal presented by [[Jim Forrestal]] and [[Arthur Radford]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945.[50] Army Intelligence agent Colonel [[Sidney Mashbir]] and Commander Ellis Zacharias worked together for four months at the direction of [[Ernest King|Fleet Admiral Joseph Ernest King]], and prepared the first draft and implementing directives for the creation of what would become the Central Intelligence Agency.[51][52][53] Despite opposition from the military establishment, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI),[54] Truman established the [[National Intelligence Authority]][55] in January 1946.
The Central Intelligence Agency was created on July 26, 1947, when President Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]] into law.
A major impetus for the creation of the agency was growing tensions with the USSR following the end of [[World War II]].[58]
Lawrence Houston, head counsel of the [[Strategic Services Unit|SSU]], CIG, and, later CIA, was principal draftsman of the [[National Security Act of 1947]],[59][60][61] which dissolved the NIA and the CIG, and established both the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the Central Intelligence Agency.[56][62] In 1949, Houston helped to draft the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] ([[Act of Congress#Public law, private law, designation|Pub.
At the outset of the [[Korean War]], the CIA still only had a few thousand employees, around one thousand of whom worked in analysis.
The CIA still lacked its intelligence-gathering abilities.[65] On August 21, 1950, shortly after, Truman announced [[Walter Bedell Smith]] as the new Director of the CIA.
The change in leadership took place shortly after the start of the [[Korean War]] in [[South Korea]], as the lack of a clear warning to the President and NSC about the imminent North Korean invasion was seen as a grave failure of intelligence.[65]
One of the main targets for intelligence gathering was the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]], which had also been a priority of the CIA's predecessors.[66][67][68]
U.S. Air Force General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], the CIG's second director, created the Office of Special Operations (OSO) and the Office of Reports and Estimates (ORE).[67] Initially, the OSO was tasked with spying and subversion overseas with a budget of $15 million (equivalent to $196 million in 2024),[69] the largesse of a small number of patrons in Congress.
On June 18, 1948, the [[National Security Council]] issued Directive 10/2[71] calling for covert action against the [[Soviet Union]],[72] and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against "hostile foreign states or groups" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government.
To this end, the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC) was created inside the CIA.[73] The OPC was unique; [[Frank Wisner]], the head of the OPC, answered not to the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]], but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC.
The agency was unable to provide sufficient intelligence about the Soviet takeovers of [[Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade of Berlin]], or the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]].
In particular, the agency failed to predict the [[Korean War#China intervenes|Chinese entry into the Korean War]] with 300,000 troops.[75][76] The famous double agent [[Kim Philby]] was the British liaison to American Central Intelligence.[77] Through him, the CIA coordinated hundreds of airdrops inside the iron curtain, all compromised by Philby.
[[Arlington Hall]], the nerve center of CIA cryptanalysis, was compromised by [[Bill Weisband]], a Russian translator and Soviet spy.[78]
However, the CIA was successful in influencing the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 Italian election]] in favor of the [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democrats]].[79] The $200 million [[Exchange Stabilization Fund]] (equivalent to $2.6 billion in 2024),[69] earmarked for the reconstruction of Europe, was used to pay wealthy Americans of Italian heritage.
Cash was then distributed to [[Catholic Action]], the [[Holy See|Vatican's]] political arm, and directly to Italian politicians.
At the beginning of the [[Korean War]], CIA officer Hans Tofte claimed to have turned a thousand [[North Korea|North Korean]] expatriates into a guerrilla force tasked with infiltration, guerrilla warfare, and pilot rescue.[81] In 1952 the CIA sent 1,500 more expatriate agents north.
[[Seoul]] station chief Albert Haney would openly celebrate the capabilities of those agents and the information they sent.[81] In September 1952 Haney was replaced by John Limond Hart, a Europe veteran with a vivid memory for bitter experiences of misinformation.[81] Hart was suspicious of the parade of successes reported by Tofte and Haney and launched an investigation which determined that the entirety of the information supplied by the Korean sources was false or misleading.[82] After the war, internal reviews by the CIA corroborated Hart's findings.
The CIA's station in [[Seoul]] had 200 officers, but not a single speaker of [[Korean language|Korean]].[82] Hart reported to Washington that Seoul station could not be salvaged.
Air Force Colonel James Kallis stated that CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] continued to praise the CIA's Korean force, despite knowing that they were under enemy control.[83] When China entered the war in 1950, the CIA attempted a number of subversive operations in the country, all of which failed due to the presence of double agents.
Millions of dollars were spent in these efforts.[84] These included a team of young CIA officers airdropped into China who were ambushed, and CIA funds being used to set up a global heroin empire in Burma's [[Golden Triangle]] following a betrayal by another double agent.[84]
In 1951, [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a member of the [[National Front]], was elected Iranian prime-minister.[85] As prime minister, he nationalized the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] which his predecessor had supported.
Fearing a loss of control, the military pulled its troops back five days later, and [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] gave in to Mosaddegh's demands.
In 1953, Mossadegh [[1953 Iranian parliamentary dissolution referendum|dismissed parliament]] and assumed dictatorial powers.
Mosaddegh launched a military [[Coup d'état|coup]], and the Shah fled the country.
Under CIA Director [[Allen Dulles]], [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Operation Ajax]] was put into motion.
Its goal was to overthrow Mossadegh with military support from General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] and install a pro-western regime headed by the Shah of Iran.
Kermit Roosevelt Jr. oversaw the operation in Iran.[86] On August 16, a CIA paid mob led by Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] would spark what a U.S. embassy officer called "an almost spontaneous revolution"[87] but Mosaddegh was protected by his new inner military circle, and the CIA had been unable to gain influence within the Iranian military.
The return of the Shah to power, and the impression that an effective CIA had been able to guide that nation to friendly and stable relations with the West, triggered planning for Operation PBSuccess, a plan to overthrow [[Guatemala|Guatemalan]] President [[Jacobo Arbenz]].[91] The plan was exposed in major newspapers before it happened after a CIA agent left plans for the coup in his [[Guatemala City]] hotel room.[92]
The [[Guatemalan Revolution]] of 1944–54 overthrew the U.S. backed dictator [[Jorge Ubico]] and brought a democratically elected government to power.
The government began an ambitious [[Decree 900|agrarian reform]] program which sought to grant land to millions of landless peasants.
The program threatened the land holdings of the [[United Fruit Company]], who lobbied for a coup by portraying these reforms as communist.[93][94][95][96]
On June 18, 1954, [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] led 480 CIA-trained men across the border from [[Honduras]] into Guatemala.
Árbenz handed over power to Colonel [[Carlos Enrique Diaz]].[98] The CIA then orchestrated a series of power transfers that ended with the confirmation of Castillo Armas as president in July 1954.[98] Armas was the first in a series of military dictators that would rule the country, leading to the brutal [[Guatemalan Civil War]] from 1960 to 1996, in which some 200,000 people were killed, mostly by the U.S.-backed military.[103]
In 1949, Colonel [[Adib Shishakli]] rose to power in Syria in a CIA-backed coup.
Four years later, he would be overthrown by the military, [[Ba'ath|Ba'athists]], and [[Communism|communists]].
The CIA and MI6 started funding right-wing members of the military but suffered a huge setback in the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]].
CIA Agent Rocky Stone, who had played a minor role in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, was working at the [[Damascus]] embassy as a diplomat but was the station chief.
This strengthened ties between Syria and Egypt, helping establish the [[United Arab Republic]], and poisoning the well for the US for the foreseeable future.[104]
The United States was suspicious of [[Sukarno]], [[Indonesia]]'s president, because of his declaration of neutrality in the Cold War.[105] After Sukarno hosted the [[Bandung Conference]], promoting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the Eisenhower White House responded with NSC 5518 authorizing "all feasible covert means" to move Indonesia into the Western sphere.[106]
One of the first parts of the operation was an 11,500-ton US Navy [[USS Thomaston|ship]] landing at [[Sumatra]], delivering weapons for as many as 8,000 potential revolutionaries.[110]
In support of the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement, formed by dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera and North Sulawesi with the aim of overthrowing the Sukarno regime, a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] piloted by CIA agent [[Allen Lawrence Pope]] attacked Indonesian military targets in April and May 1958.[111] The CIA described the airstrikes to the President as attacks by "dissident planes." Pope's B-26 was shot down over Ambon, Indonesia on May 18, 1958, and he bailed out.
When he was captured, the Indonesian military found his personnel records, after-action reports, and his membership card for the officer's club at [[Clark Field]].
On March 9, [[John Foster Dulles]], the Secretary of State and brother of [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[Allen Dulles]], made a public statement calling for a revolt against communist despotism under Sukarno.
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] became independent from [[Belgium]] in 1960.[114] The United States feared that its new prime minister, [[Patrice Lumumba]], was susceptible to Soviet influence, so the CIA supported [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] in organizing [[Dissolution of the Lumumba Government#Mobutu's coup|a coup]] that deposed Lumumba on September 14, 1960.[115] Lumumba was assassinated by his Congolese and Belgian enemies in 1961, with CIA acquiescence.[116] The CIA continued to back the Mobutu regime throughout the Cold War, despite its corruption, mismanagement, and human rights abuses.[117]
After the [[Bomber gap|bomber gap]] came the [[Missile gap|missile gap]].
Eisenhower wanted to use the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] to disprove the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary [[Khrushchev]] at [[Camp David]].
On May 1, 1960, the [[Soviet Air Forces]] shot down a U-2 flying over Soviet territory.
The CIA welcomed [[Fidel Castro]] on his visit to [[Washington, D.C.]], and gave him a face-to-face briefing.
Bissell Jr.|Dick Bissell]] sought, with the full backing of the CIA, to hire the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to assassinate Castro.[120]
The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] was a failed military invasion of [[Cuba]] undertaken by the CIA-sponsored paramilitary group [[Brigade 2506]] on April 17, 1961.
A counter-revolutionary military, trained and funded by the CIA, Brigade 2506 fronted the armed wing of the [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Democratic Revolutionary Front]] (DRF) and intended to overthrow Castro's [[Politics of Cuba|increasingly communist government]].
Launched from [[Guatemala]], the invading force was defeated within three days by the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]], under Castro's direct command.
Over 1,400 paramilitaries set out for Cuba by boat on April 13 for a [[Amphibious warfare|marine invasion]].
Two days later on April 15, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers attacked Cuban airfields.
On the night of April 16, the land invasion began in the [[Bay of Pigs]], but by April 20, the invaders finally surrendered.
This led eventually to the events of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962.
The invasion was a major embarrassment for [[US foreign policy]].
The [[Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General|Inspector General of the CIA]] investigated the Bay of Pigs.
After the failure of the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA proposed [[Operation Mongoose]], a program of [[Sabotage|sabotage]] and [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] against civilian and military targets in Cuba, with the stated intent to bring down the Cuban administration and institute a new government.[121] It also sought to force the Cuban government to introduce intrusive civil measures and divert resources to protect its citizens from the attacks.[122] It was authorized by [[John F.
The CIA established a base for the operation, with the cryptonym [[JMWAVE]], at a disused [[Naval Air Station Richmond|naval facility]] on the [[University of Miami]] campus.
They were a major factor contributing to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] decision to place missiles in Cuba, leading to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].[132][133]
The attacks continued through 1965.[133] Though the level of terrorist activity directed by the CIA lessened in the second half of the 1960s, in 1969 the CIA was directed to intensify its operations against Cuba.[134] Exile terrorists were still in the employ of the CIA in the mid-1970s, including [[Luis Posada Carriles]].[135][136][137] He remained on the CIA's payroll until mid-1976,[135][137] and is widely believed to be responsible for the October 1976 [[Cubana de Aviación Flight 455|Cubana 455 flight bombing]], killing 73 people – the deadliest instance of airline terrorism in the western hemisphere prior to the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 2001]] in New York.[135][136][137]
The CIA and the United States government were involved in the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]].
The coup occurred from March 31 to April 1, which resulted in the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] ousting President [[João Goulart]].
Secret cables written by the US Ambassador to Brazil, [[Lincoln Gordon]], confirmed that the CIA was involved in covert action in Brazil.
The [[CIA Tibetan program]] consisted of political plots, [[Propaganda|propaganda]] distribution, [[Paramilitary|paramilitary]] operations, and intelligence gathering based on U.S. commitments made to the [[Dalai Lama]] in 1951 and 1956.[139]
The OSS Patti mission arrived in [[Vietnam]] near the end of [[World War II]] and had significant interaction with the leaders of many Vietnamese factions, including [[Ho Chi Minh]].[140]
During the period of U.S. combat involvement in the Vietnam War, there was considerable argument about progress among the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]], the CIA, and, to some extent, the intelligence staff of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|Military Assistance Command Vietnam]].[141]
Sometime between 1959 and 1961, the CIA started Project Tiger, a program of dropping [[South Vietnam]] agents into [[North Vietnam]] to gather intelligence.
These were failures; the Deputy Chief for Project Tiger, Captain Do Van Tien, admitted that he was an agent for [[Hanoi]].[142]
In the face of the failure of Project Tiger, [[The Pentagon|the Pentagon]] wanted CIA paramilitary forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A.
Johnson wanted CIA Director Richard Helms to substantiate Johnson's hunch that Moscow and Beijing were financing and influencing the American antiwar movement.[144] Thus, in the fall of 1967, the CIA launched a domestic surveillance program code-named [[Operation CHAOS|Chaos]] that would linger for a total of seven years.
From 1968 to 1972, the CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] involved the killing, without trial, of between twenty and forty thousand South Vietnamese civilians suspected to be members of what Americans called the "Infrastructure" – the non-military administrative and political components of the Communists' organizational structure.
Thousands were tortured prior to being killed, by such methods as the repeated application of [[Electrocution|electrical shock]] to the brain, and the drilling of a dowel through the ear canal into the brain until the person died.[147]
Conditions worsened in the mid-1970s, around the time of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]].
Revelations about past CIA activities, such as assassinations and [[Human rights violations by the CIA#Assassination and targeted killing|attempted assassinations of foreign leaders]] (most notably Fidel Castro and Rafael Trujillo) and illegal domestic spying on U.S. citizens, provided the opportunities to increase Congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations.[148]
In 1971, the NSA and CIA were engaged in domestic spying; the DOD was eavesdropping on [[Henry Kissinger]].
Famously, Nixon's [[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]] had in their number many former CIA officers, including [[Howard Hunt]], [[James W.
McCord Jr.|Jim McCord]], and [[Eugenio Martinez]].
On July 7, 1971, [[John Ehrlichman]], Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman "know that [Hunt] was, in fact, doing some things for the President...
Hastening the CIA's fall from grace was the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by former CIA officers, and President [[Richard Nixon]]'s subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary.
Haldeman]], to tell the CIA that further investigation of Watergate would "open the whole can of worms about the Bay of Pigs".[150][151] In this way Nixon and Haldeman ensured that the CIA's No. 1 and No. 2 ranking officials, [[Richard Helms]] and [[Vernon A.
Walters|Vernon Walters]], communicated to FBI Director [[L.
Patrick Gray]] that the FBI should not follow the money trail from the burglars to the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], as it would uncover CIA informants in Mexico.
I mean ruin it – the old Foreign Service – and to build a new one." He had similar designs for the CIA and intended to replace Helms with [[James Schlesinger]].[153] Nixon had promised that Helms could stay on until his 60th birthday, the mandatory retirement age.
Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on [[Project MKUltra]].
This became the [[Family Jewels]].
It included information linking the CIA to the assassination of foreign leaders, the illegal surveillance of some 7,000 U.S. citizens involved in the antiwar movement ([[Operation CHAOS]]), its [[Project MKUltra|experiments on U.S. and Canadian citizens without their knowledge]], secretly giving them [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (among other things) and observing the results.[148] This prompted Congress to create the [[Church Committee]] in the Senate, and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Pike Committee]] in the House.
President [[Gerald Ford]] created the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]],[148] and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders.
In December 1974 the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] reported that the CIA had collected intelligence files on at least 10,000 Americans and engaged in dozens of other illegal activities beginning in the 1950s, including break-ins, wiretapping and mail inspections, in violation of its 1947 charter which prohibited it from taking action on American soil and against US citizens.[157]
Acting Attorney General [[Laurence Silberman]] learned of the existence of the Family Jewels and issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA.
[[Bill Colby]]'s short tenure as DCI would end with the [[Halloween Massacre]].
[[Chad|Chad's]] neighbor [[Libya]] was a major source of weaponry to communist rebel forces.
The CIA seized the opportunity to arm and finance Chad's prime minister, [[Hissène Habré]], after he created a breakaway government in western [[Sudan]].[159]
In [[Afghanistan]], the CIA funneled several billion dollars' worth of weapons,[160] including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[Surface-to-air missiles|surface-to-air missiles]],[161] to [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI)—which funneled them to tens of thousands of [[Afghan mujahideen]] resistance fighters in order to fight the Soviets and the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan War]].[162][163][164] In total, the CIA sent approximately 2,300 Stingers to Afghanistan, creating a substantial [[Black market|black market]] for the weapons throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, and even parts of Africa that persisted well into the 1990s.
Under President [[Jimmy Carter]], the CIA was conducting covertly funded support for the [[Contras]] in their war against the [[Sandinistas]].
In March 1981, Reagan told [[United States Congress|Congress]] that the CIA would protect [[El Salvador]] by preventing the Sandinistas from shipping arms to communist rebels in El Salvador.
The CIA also began arming and training the [[Contras]] in [[Honduras]] in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in [[Nicaragua]].[166] The CIA was involved in the [[Iran–Contra affair]] arms smuggling scandal.
Repercussions from the scandal included the creation of the [[Intelligence Authorization Act]] in 1991.
This also required an authorizing chain of command, including an official, [[Presidential finding|presidential finding]] report and the informing of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which, in emergencies, requires only "timely notification."  Critics have alleged that the CIA was also [[CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking|involved in Contra cocaine trafficking]].[167][168]
The CIA's prime source in Lebanon was [[Bashir Gemayel]], a member of the [[Christian Maronite]] sect.
[[Israel]] [[1982 Lebanon War|invaded Lebanon]], and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel.
[[Imad Mughniyah]], a [[Hezbollah]] assassin, targeted Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], and the US Marines of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Multi-National Force]] for their role in opposing the [[PLO]] in Lebanon.
On April 18, 1983, a 2,000 lb car bomb [[1984 US embassy bombing in Beirut|exploded in the lobby of the American embassy]] in [[Beirut]], killing 63 people, including 17 Americans and 7 CIA officers, including [[Robert Ames]], one of the CIA's Middle East experts.
On October 23, 1983, two bombs ([[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|1983 Beirut Bombing]]) were set off in Beirut, including a 10-ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people.
The embassy bombing killed Ken Haas, the CIA's Station Chief in [[Beirut]].
[[William Francis Buckley|Bill Buckley]] was sent in to replace him.
On March 7, 1984, Jeremy Levin, [[CNN]]'s Bureau Chief in Beirut, was kidnapped.
Twelve more Americans were captured in Beirut during the [[Reagan Administration]].
[[Manucher Ghorbanifar]], a former [[Savak]] agent, was an information seller, and was discredited over his record of misinformation.
He reached out to the agency offering a [[Back channel|back channel]] to Iran, suggesting a trade of missiles that would be lucrative to the intermediaries.[169]
It has been alleged by such authors as [[Ahmed Rashid]] that the CIA and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] have been waging a clandestine war.
On May 11, 1998, CIA Director George Tenet and his agency were taken aback by India's [[Pokhran-II|second nuclear test]].
The test prompted concerns from its nuclear-capable adversary, [[Pakistan]], and, "remade the balance of power in the world." The nuclear test was [[New Delhi]]'s calculated response to Pakistan previously testing new missiles in its expanding arsenal.
Unlike the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]], the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] supported the [[Solidarity]] movement in [[Poland]], and – based on CIA intelligence – waged a public relations campaign to deter what the Carter administration felt was "an imminent move by large Soviet military forces into Poland." Colonel Ryszard Kukliński, a senior officer on the Polish General Staff, was secretly sending reports to the CIA.[171]
There were no direct links between the CIA and Solidarność, and all money was channeled through third parties.[172] CIA officers were barred from meeting Solidarity leaders, and the CIA's contacts with Solidarność activists were weaker than those of the [[AFL–CIO]], which raised 300 thousand dollars from its members, which were used to provide material and cash directly to Solidarity, with no control of Solidarity's use of it.
CIA support for Solidarity included money, equipment and training, which was coordinated by Special Operations CIA division.[175] [[Henry Hyde]], U.S. House intelligence committee member, said that the U.S. provided "supplies and technical assistance in terms of clandestine newspapers, broadcasting, propaganda, money, organizational help and advice".[176] Michael Reisman of Yale Law School named operations in Poland as one of the CIA's [[Cold War]] covert operations.[177]
During the [[Cold War]], the CIA and [[NATO]] were involved in [[Operation Gladio]].[180][181] As part of Operation Gladio, the CIA supported the Italian government, and allegedly supported [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist organizations]][182][183][184] such as National Vanguard, New Order and the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] during the [[Years of Lead|Years of Lead in Italy]].
In [[Turkey]], Gladio was called [[Counter-Guerrilla]].
CIA efforts strengthened the [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] movement through the founding member of the Counter-Guerrilla; [[Alparslan Türkeş]].[185] Other [[Far-right politics|far-right]] individuals employed by the CIA as part of Counter-Guerilla included [[Ruzi Nazar]], a former [[SS]] officer and Pan-Turkist.[186]
During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the CIA had backed both sides.
In the weeks before the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], the CIA downplayed the military buildup.
[[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s announcement of the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet troops took the CIA by surprise.
On January 25, 1993, [[Mir Qazi]] [[1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters|opened fire at the CIA headquarters]] in Langley, Virginia, killing two officers and wounding three others.[190] On February 26, Al-Qaeda terrorists led by [[Ramzi Yousef]] [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|bombed the parking garage]] below the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], killing six people and injuring 1,402 others.
During the [[Bosnian War]], the CIA ignored signs within and without[clarification needed] of the [[Srebrenica massacre]].
To force [[Slobodan Milošević]] to withdraw his troops from Kosovo, the CIA had been invited to provide military targets for bombings, wherein the agency's analysts used tourist maps to determine the location.[192] However, the agency incorrectly provided the coordinates of the Chinese Embassy as a target resulting in its bombing.
In [[Guatemala]], the CIA produced the Murphy Memo, based on audio recordings made by [[Covert listening device|covert listening devices]] planted by Guatemalan intelligence in the bedroom of Ambassador [[Marilyn McAfee]].
Ambassador McAfee was calling to Murphy, her [[Poodle|poodle]].[194]
[[Harold James Nicholson]] would burn[clarification needed] several serving officers and three years of trainees before he was caught spying for Russia.
In 1997 the House would pen another report, which said that CIA officers know little about the language or politics of the people they spy on; the conclusion was that the CIA lacked the "depth, breadth, and expertise to monitor political, military, and economic developments worldwide."[195] Russ Travers said in the CIA in-house journal that in five years "intelligence failure is inevitable".[196] In 1997 the CIA's new director [[George Tenet]] would promise a new working agency by 2002.
After the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]] by [[Al Qaeda]], the CIA offered two targets to be [[Operation Infinite Reach|hit in retaliation]].
One of them was the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]], where traces of chemical weapon precursors had been detected.
On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled [[Aldrich Ames]] out of his Jaguar.[198] In the investigation that ensued, the CIA [[1995 CIA disinformation controversy|discovered]] that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents.
Agency files show that it is believed [[Osama bin Laden]] was funding the Afghan rebels against the USSR in the 1980s.[201] In 1991, bin Laden returned to his native [[Saudi Arabia]] protesting the presence of troops, and [[Operation Desert Storm]].
In 1998, bin Laden would declare war on America, and, on August 7, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|strike in Tanzania and Nairobi]].
On October 12, 2000, Al Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|bombed the USS Cole]].
Clarke]] sent [[National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] warning of the risks, and decrying the inaction of the CIA.[202]
In January 1996, the CIA created an experimental "virtual station," the [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], under the Counterterrorist Center, to track bin Laden's developing activities.
FBI Special Agent Dan Coleman (who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been "seconded" to the bin Laden Station) called him Qaeda's "[[Rosetta Stone]]".[203]
The Counterterrorist Center, its new chief, [[Cofer Black]], and the center's [[Bin Laden Issue Station|bin Laden unit]] were the plan's developers and executors.
Allen]] to set up a "Qaeda cell" to oversee its tactical execution.[204] In 2000, the CIA and [[United States Air Force|USAF]] jointly ran a series of flights over Afghanistan with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance drone, the [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]]; they obtained probable photos of bin Laden.
On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 Al-Qaeda members]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four passenger jets within the [[Northeastern United States]] in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks.
Two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], the third into [[The Pentagon|the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and the fourth inadvertently into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]].
The attacks cost the [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|lives of 2,996 people (including the 19 hijackers)]], caused the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the Twin Towers]], and damaged the western side of the Pentagon.
According to unnamed CIA sources, while [[First responder|first responders]], military personnel and [[Volunteering|volunteers]] were conducting rescue efforts at the [[World Trade Center site]], a special CIA team was searching the rubble for both digital and paper copies of classified documents.
[[Anwar al-Awlaki]], a [[Yemeni Americans|Yemeni American]] U.S. citizen and al-Qaeda member, was killed on September 30, 2011, by a CIA drone strike in Yemen.[212][213] Al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son, a noncombatant and U.S. citizen, was also killed in a separate strike.[213] Although approved by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the strikes sparked discussion on the legality of killing American citizens without trial.[212]
A major criticism is a failure to forestall the [[September 11 attacks]].
The [[11 Commission Report|9/11 Commission Report]] identified failures in the IC as a whole.
The report concluded that former DCI [[George Tenet]] failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by [[Al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda]] prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.[214] The report was finished in June 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with Congress, over the objections of current DCI General [[Michael Hayden]].
In 1989; Yugoslavia officially dissolved into six republics, with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines: [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]].
This quickly dissolved into ethnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and other [[Balkan]] ethnicities.
Seventy-two days after the 9/11 attacks, President Bush told Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] to update the US [[Military operation plan|plan]] for an invasion of [[Iraq]], but not to tell anyone.
By December 2002, the CIA had close to a dozen functional networks in Iraq[220]: 242  and would penetrate Iraq's [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]], tap the encrypted communications of the deputy prime minister, and recruit the bodyguard of Hussein's son[which?] as an agent.
To the CIA, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] had to occur before the end of February 2003 if their sources inside Hussein's government were to survive.
The case [[Colin Powell]] presented before the [[United Nations]] (purportedly proving an Iraqi WMD program) was inaccurate.
The sole source for the [[Allegations of Iraqi mobile weapons laboratories|allegations of Iraqi mobile weapons laboratories]], code-named [[Curveball]], was a known liar.[222] A postmortem of the intelligence failures in the lead up to Iraq led by former DDCI Richard Kerr would conclude that the CIA had been a casualty of the Cold War, wiped out in a way "analogous to the effect of the meteor strikes on the dinosaurs."[223]
The CIA would see some success with its "Scorpion" paramilitary teams composed of CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary officers, along with friendly Iraqi [[Partisan|partisans]].
CIA SAD officers would also help the US [[10th Special Forces Group|10th Special Forces]].[220][224][225] The occupation of Iraq would be a low point in the history of the CIA.
In Iraq, almost 500 transient officers would be trapped inside the [[Green Zone]] while Iraq station chiefs would rotate with only a little less frequency.[226]
The [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]] created the office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's.[227] The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the [[Intelligence cycle management|intelligence cycle]].
Bush|President Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13470]][228] amending [[Executive Order 12333]] to strengthen the role of the DNI.[229]
The [[National Security Advisor]] is a permanent member of the National Security Council, responsible for briefing the President with pertinent information collected by all U.S. intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, etc.
On May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that [[Osama bin Laden]] was killed earlier that day by "a small team of Americans" operating in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, during a CIA operation.[230][231] The raid was executed from a CIA forward base in Afghanistan by elements of the U.S. Navy's [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] and CIA paramilitary operatives.[232]
The operation was a result of years of intelligence work that included the CIA's capture and [[Interrogational torture|interrogation]] of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed|Khalid Sheik Mohammad]], which led to the identity of a courier of bin Laden's,[233][234][235] the tracking of the courier to the compound by [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary operatives and the establishing of a CIA safe house to provide critical tactical intelligence for the operation.[236][237][238]
The CIA ran a fake vaccination clinic in an attempt to locate [[Osama bin Laden]].
In some rural areas, vaccination workers were banned by the Taliban or chased away by locals.[239][240] There have been many deadly attacks by militants against vaccination workers in Pakistan.[241] Efforts to eradicate polio have furthermore been disrupted by [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|American drone strikes]].[239]
Under the aegis of operation [[Timber Sycamore]] and other clandestine activities, [[Special Activities Center|CIA operatives]] and [[United States special operations forces|U.S. special operations troops]] have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year.[242] The CIA has been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012.[243] These weapons have been reportedly falling into hands of extremists, such as [[Al-Nusra Front|al-Nusra Front]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].[244][245][246] Around February 2017, the CIA was instructed to halt military aid to Syrian rebels (Free Syrian Army or FSA), which also included training, ammunition, guided missiles, and salaries.
It was reported in July 2017 that President [[Donald Trump]] had ordered a "phasing out" of the CIA's support for anti-[[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]] rebels.[248]
A new [[Policy|policy]] introduced by President Barack [[Obama]] removed the authority of the CIA to launch drone attacks and allowed these attacks only under [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] command.
For decades until 2018, the CIA secretly owned [[Crypto AG]], a small Swiss company that made encryption devices, in association with West German intelligence.
Until the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community, one of the "services of common concern" that the CIA provided was [[Open-source intelligence|open-source intelligence]] from the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS).[253] FBIS, which had absorbed the Joint Publication Research Service, a military organization that translated documents,[254] moved into the [[National Open Source Enterprise]] under the Director of National Intelligence.
During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], Michael Sekora (assigned to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]), worked with agencies across the intelligence community, including the CIA, to develop and deploy a technology-based competitive strategy system called [[Project Socrates]].
The technology-focused Socrates system supported such programs as the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in addition to private sector projects.[255][256]
Increasingly, the CIA is a major consumer of social media intelligence.[257] CIA launched a [[Twitter]] account in June 2014.[258] CIA also launched its own [[.onion]] website to collect anonymous feedback.[259]
[[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]], former Director of National Intelligence, was about to publicize an investigation report of outsourcing by U.S. intelligence agencies, as required by Congress.[260] However, this report was then classified.[261][262] Hillhouse speculates that this report includes requirements for the CIA to report:[261][263]
According to investigative journalist [[Tim Shorrock]]:
The NRO, then under DCI authority, contracted more of the design that had been their tradition, and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience, [[Boeing]].
The next-generation satellite [[Future Imagery Architecture]] project "how does heaven look," which missed objectives after $4 billion in cost overruns, was the result of this contract.[266][267]
The agency ran an operation code-named "Chaos" that ran from 1967 to 1974 where they routinely performed surveillance on Americans who were a part of various peace groups protesting the [[Vietnam War]].
The program was exposed by the [[Church Committee]] in 1975 as a part of the investigation into the [[Watergate scandal]].[217][269]
The CIA also conducted a secret program called [[MKUltra]], which ran from the early 1950s to the 1970s and involved illegal human experimentation to develop mind-control techniques.
Subjects were often unaware they were part of the experiments, which included the administration of psychoactive drugs like [[LSD]] and other methods of [[Manipulation|psychological manipulation]].[270][271] The program, exposed in the 1970s, led to widespread public outrage and calls for greater oversight of intelligence agencies.[272]
The CIA was also linked to the [[Iran–Contra affair|Iran-Contra Affair]] wherein missiles were sold to the Iranian government as an exchange for the release of hostages and the profits the agency made from selling the weapons at a marked-up price went towards assisting the contras in Nicaragua.
Another source of controversy has been the CIA's role in [[Operation Condor]], which was a United States-backed campaign of repression and state terrorism involving intelligence operations, CIA-backed coup d'états and assassinations against leaders in [[South America]] from 1968 to 1989.
By the Operation's end in 1989, up to 80,000 people had been killed.[273] Similarly, the CIA was complicit in the actions of [[Death squads|death squads]] in [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] and [[Battalion 3-16|Honduras]].[274][275]
An additional controversy surrounds the Bush Administration's claim that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq had "weapons of mass destruction"]] in 2002, and again in 2003 as justification for invading the Middle Eastern country.
