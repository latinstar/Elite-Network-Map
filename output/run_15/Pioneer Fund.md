The Pioneer Fund is an American [[Non-profit organization|non-profit foundation]] established in 1937 "to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences".
The organization has been described as [[Scientific racism|racist]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] in nature.[2][3][4][5] The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] classifies the Pioneer Fund as a [[Hate group|hate group]].[6][7] One of its first projects was to fund the distribution in US churches and schools of [[Erbkrank]], a [[Nazi]] [[Propaganda film|propaganda film]] about [[Eugenics|eugenics]].[8]
Philippe Rushton]], who was succeeded by [[Richard Lynn]].[9][10] After Lynn's death in 2023, much of the activity of the Pioneer Fund shifted to the [[Human Diversity Foundation]].[11][12]
Two of the best known studies funded by Pioneer Fund are the [[Minnesota Twin Family Study#Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart|Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart]][13] and the Texas Adoption Project, which studied the similarities and differences of [[Identical twins|identical twins]] and other children adopted into non-biological families.
Research backed by the fund on [[Race and intelligence|race and intelligence]] has generated controversy and criticism.
One prominent example is the 1994 book [[The Bell Curve]], which drew heavily from Pioneer-funded research.[14][15] The fund also has ties to [[Eugenics|eugenics]],[16] and has both current and former links to white supremacist publications such as [[American Renaissance]] and [[Mankind Quarterly]].
The first, modeled on the Nazi [[Lebensborn]] breeding program,[17] was aimed at encouraging the propagation of those "descended predominantly from white persons who settled in the original thirteen states prior to the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] and/or from related stocks, or to classes of children, the majority of whom are deemed to be so descended".
The first five directors were [[Wickliffe Preston Draper]], [[Harry Laughlin]], [[Frederick Osborn]], [[Malcolm Donald]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]].
He founded Pioneer Fund after having acquired an interest in the Eugenics movement, which was strengthened by his 1935 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], where he met with the leading eugenicists of the Third Reich who used the inspiration from the American movement as a basis for the [[Nuremberg Laws]].

never pursued a profession or held a job of any kind."[3] According to a 1960 article in [[The Nation]], an unnamed geneticist said Draper told him he "wished to prove simply that Negroes were inferior."[21] Draper funded advocacy of repatriation of black people to Africa.[22][23]
[[Harry Laughlin]] was the director of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] on Long Island, New York.
He opposed [[Miscegenation|miscegenation]] and had proposed a research agenda to assist in the enforcement of Southern "race integrity laws" by developing techniques for identifying the "pass-for-white" person who might "successfully hide all of his black blood".[3] He singled out Jews and fought efforts to allow entry into the United States to Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany.[19] Eleven months after the enactment of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Laughlin wrote to an official at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (which had awarded him an honorary doctorate) that the United States and the [[Third Reich]] shared "a common understanding of ...
[[Frederick Osborn]] wrote in 1937 that the Nazi [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] was "the most exciting experiment that had ever been tried".[24][18] Osborn was the secretary of the [[American Eugenics Society]], which was part of an accepted and active field at the time; the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Selective Service during [[World War II]]; and later the deputy US representative to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission|UN Atomic Energy Commission]].
[[Malcolm Donald]] was the Draper family lawyer and trustee of the Draper estate.
He was a former editor of the [[Harvard Law Review]] and a [[Brigadier general|brigadier general]] during World War II.
[[John Marshall Harlan II]], whose firm had done legal work for the Pioneer Fund, was the only director whose name did not appear in the incorporation papers.
He was director of operational analysis for the [[Eighth Air Force]] in World War II, and was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by President [[Dwight D.
Sims]] and [[Miranda v.
Following [[Jesse Helms]]'s [[United States Senate election in North Carolina, 1984|1984 Senate re-election bid]], [[The Washington Post]] journalists [[Thomas B.
Edsall]] and [[David A.
Vise]] reported that both Helms and [[Thomas F.
Parrott]] (1973–2000),[27] [[J.
Philippe Rushton]], [[Richard Lynn]] and [[Gerhard Meisenberg]] (as of 2019).[28]
Rushton, who headed Pioneer until 2012, spoke at conferences of the [[American Renaissance]] (AR) magazine, in which he has also published articles.[29] Anti-racist [[Searchlight]] magazine described one such AR conference as a "veritable 'who's who' of American white supremacy."[30]
In October 2024, UK anti-racist group [[Hope not Hate]] reported that the Pioneer Fund had rebranded as the [[Human Diversity Foundation]].[12]
The Pioneer Fund was described by the London [[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]] (March 12, 1989) as a "neo-Nazi organization closely integrated with the far right in American politics."[31]
The Pioneer Fund supported the distribution of a eugenics film titled [[Erbkrank]] ("Hereditary Defective" or "Hereditary Illness") which was published by the pre-war 1930s [[Nazi Party]].
William Draper obtained the film from the predecessor to the Nazi [[Office of Racial Policy]] (Rassenpolitisches Amt) prior to the founding of the Pioneer Fund.[3] According to the Pioneer Fund site, all founders capable of doing so participated in the war against the Nazis.[32]

Garrett]] (a [[White Citizens Council]] member[33] and educator known for his belief in the genetic inferiority of blacks), and Senator [[James O.
Eastland]] of Mississippi, head of the Draper Genetics Committee.[34] Draper also made large financial contributions to efforts to oppose the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and the racial [[Desegregation|desegregation]] mandated by [[Brown v.
Board of Education]], such as $215,000 to the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] in 1963.[3]
As of 1994, the Pioneer Fund distributed more than $1 million per year to academics.[33] [[Hampton University]] sociology professor Steven J.
The Southern Poverty Law Center listed the Pioneer Fund as a [[Hate group|hate group]] in 2003, citing the fund's history, its funding of race and intelligence research, and its connections with [[Racism|racist]] individuals.[6][7]
Many of the researchers whose findings support the [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] hypothesis of [[Race and intelligence|racial IQ]] disparity have received grants of varying sizes from the Pioneer Fund.[39] Large grantees, in order of amount received, are:
The fund gave the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR) a total of $1.3 million between 1985 and 1994.[48] Among the grants was $150,000 for "studies in connection with immigration policies".[19] Funding was dropped after negative publicity during the campaign for California's [[California Proposition 187|Proposition 187]] linked the Pioneer Fund to ads purchased by FAIR.[49][50] Other [[Immigration reduction|immigration reduction]] groups that have received donations from the Pioneer Fund include ProjectUSA[51] and [[American Immigration Control Foundation]].[52]
One of the grantees is the [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] and [[White supremacist|white supremacist]] journalist [[Jared Taylor]], the editor of [[American Renaissance]] and a member of the advisory board of the white nationalist publication [[The Occidental Quarterly]].
Another is Roger Pearson's Institute for the Study of Man.[6] Many of the key academic white nationalists in both [[Right Now!]] and American Renaissance have been funded by the Pioneer Fund, which was also directly involved in funding the parent organization of American Renaissance, the [[New Century Foundation]].[39]
