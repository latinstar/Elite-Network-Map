[[Próspera]], a charter city located in [[Honduras]], operates autonomously under a distinct legal and fiscal framework and is principally led by [[Honduras Próspera Inc.]]. [[Honduras Próspera Inc.]] exerts significant control over [[Próspera]] through its venture capitalist funding and a veto vote within [[Próspera]]'s governing council, which consists of five elected members and four appointed by the corporation. The initiative is ideologically aligned with libertarian theory, as observed by historian [[Quinn Slobodian]], and its model has been significantly influenced by the [[Charter Cities Institute (CCI)]], a Washington, DC-based organization promoting special jurisdictions globally. The legal framework for ZEDEs, which enabled [[Próspera]]'s establishment, was introduced via a 2013 constitutional amendment during the presidency of [[Porfirio Lobo]] and was championed by former President [[Juan Orlando Hernández]]. The concept of [[Próspera]] was conceived by [[Erick Brimen]], CEO of both [[Próspera]] and [[NeWay Capital]], who utilized intermediate companies like [[Brimont Holding]] and [[North Shore Development Company]] for land acquisition. [[Próspera]] draws substantial financial backing from prominent investors such as [[Balaji Srinivasan]], [[Peter Thiel]], and [[Marc Andreessen]] through the venture capital firm [[Pronomos Capital]], and [[Coinbase]]'s venture capital division, led by CEO [[Brian Armstrong]], has also committed to investing in the project. Architect [[Patrik Schumacher]] designed [[Próspera]]'s initial buildings, symbolizing its physical development. Despite its continued operation, [[Próspera]] faces strong political opposition from Honduran President [[Xiomara Castro]], who repealed the ZEDE law citing sovereignty concerns and publicly referred to [[Próspera]] as a creation of a "narco-regime." In response to the repeal, [[Honduras Próspera Inc.]] initiated a lawsuit against [[Honduras]] seeking up to $10.7 billion in damages, a claim that was allowed to proceed by the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)]], subsequently leading [[Honduras]] to withdraw from [[ICSID]]. [[Erick Brimen]] has actively engaged in lobbying [[U.S. legislators]] to impose sanctions on [[Honduras]] and terminate U.S. aid if [[Próspera]]'s operations are obstructed, directly influencing U.S. Representative [[Steven Horsford]], to whom Brimen made a campaign donation, to pressure the Honduran government. U.S. Representative [[María Elvira Salazar]] has also publicly voiced support for the ZEDEs and [[Próspera]], characterizing opposition as socialist ideology. The [[U.S. State Department]] has additionally expressed concerns that the repeal of the ZEDE law could violate international trade agreements, implicitly supporting the continued viability of entities like [[Próspera]]. However, even [[Paul Romer]], the Nobel laureate who originally proposed the charter city concept, explicitly rejects [[Próspera]], labeling it a "libertarian fantasy." Furthermore, local residents in the neighboring village of [[Crawfish Rock]] have expressed fears of land expropriation by [[Próspera]].
