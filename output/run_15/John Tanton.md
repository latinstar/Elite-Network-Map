[[John Tanton]] was a pivotal anti-immigration activist, white nationalist, and pro-eugenics advocate, who meticulously constructed an extensive network of influential organizations. He founded the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)]], which garnered early support from [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]], and controversially accepted funding from the pro-eugenics [[Pioneer Fund]] under Tanton's leadership. [[Tanton]] further expanded his influence by co-founding the anti-immigration think tank [[Center for Immigration Studies]] and the lobbying group [[NumbersUSA]]. His advocacy extended to language policy, as he co-founded [[U.S. English]] with [[S. I. Hayakawa]] and also chaired [[ProEnglish]]. A leaked 1986 memo written by [[Tanton]] led to his resignation as chairman of [[U.S. English]] and the subsequent departure of prominent supporters including [[Linda Chavez]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Saul Bellow]], and [[Gore Vidal]]. Furthermore, [[Tanton]] established [[The Social Contract Press]], publishing the nativist journal "[[The Social Contract]]" and co-authoring "[[The Immigrant Invasion]]" with [[Wayne Lutton]]. He founded the pro-eugenics organization [[Society for Genetic Education (SAGE)]] and briefly served as president of [[Zero Population Growth]]. [[Tanton]]'s broader network of influence encompassed co-founding or significant involvement in groups like [[American Immigration Control Foundation]], [[American Patrol/Voices of Citizens Together]], [[Californians for Population Stabilization]], and [[ProjectUSA]]. Financial support for many of these endeavors flowed through [[U.S. Inc.]], an entity [[John Tanton]] established, which also supported organizations like [[Scenic Michigan]], the [[International Dark-Sky Association]], the [[Foreign Policy Association's Great Decisions Series]], and the [[Harbor Springs chapter of the North Country Trail Association]]. Early in his career, [[Tanton]] founded the Petoskey chapter of the [[Sierra Club]] and helped establish the northern Michigan chapter of [[Planned Parenthood]], although he later diverged from these groups over immigration policy. [[Tanton]] also served on the Board of [[Population-Environment Balance]]. His views, which blended ecological concerns with explicit racial and eugenic arguments, evolved to become overtly racist, attracting admiration from figures like [[Jared Taylor]]. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)]] designated six of Tanton's founded groups as hate groups and identified [[Tanton]] as the "puppeteer of the nativist movement," highlighting his deep ties to white supremacists and eugenicists. ProPublica noted that [[Tanton]]'s ideology and rhetoric influenced contemporary figures like [[Tucker Carlson]], white supremacist [[Richard Spencer]], and [[Ann Coulter]], and regrettably inspired perpetrators of terrorist attacks, including [[Brenton Tarrant]] in Christchurch and the El Paso shooter. His wife, [[Mary Lou Tanton]], chairs the [[U.S. Immigration Reform PAC]] and co-founded [[Scenic Michigan]], an entity also supported by Tanton's [[U.S. Inc.]].
