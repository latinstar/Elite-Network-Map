In 2017, Burr co-sponsored the [[Israel Anti-Boycott Act]] (s.
720), which would have made it a federal crime for Americans to [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|encourage or participate in boycotts]] against [[Israel]] and [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] to protest actions of the Israeli government.[62][63]

Burr voted for the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], the only Southern Republican senator to do so.[92][93][94][95][96][97] The bill repealed the Defense Department's [[Don't ask, don't tell|don't ask, don't tell]] policy of employment discrimination against openly gay individuals.
Burr and [[John Ensign]] were the only senators who voted against cloture but for passage;[98] Burr said he opposed taking up the issue of DADT repeal amid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but voted in favor of the bill anyway, becoming one of eight Republicans who backed the final repeal bill.[95]

In 2016, Burr said he would attempt to block any future Supreme Court nominations made by [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton]] if she won the presidency in 2016, adding, "I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court."[75][113]

In 2015, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr proposed a five-year extension of the [[Patriot Act]], which was set to expire in May 2015.[116] Though he originally supported legislation which would reauthorize Patriot Act programs without any reforms,[116] he later softened his position in light of House opposition.[117] Burr was a prominent advocate of retaining language in any reauthorizing legislation to allow the [[National Security Agency]] to continue bulk collection of metadata of private telephone records.[117] Ultimately, the Senate rejected controversial amendments in line with Burr's proposals introduced by then-[[Senate majority leader|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]],[118] and Congress passed the [[USA Freedom Act]], signed into law in June 2015, which instead allowed the NSA to subpoena the data from telephone companies.[119][120][121]
In 2016, after the [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]], Burr and Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] circulated a draft bill (which was subsequently leaked) that would create a "[[Backdoor|backdoor]]" mandate, requiring technology companies to design encryption so as to provide law enforcement with user data in an "intelligible format" when required to do so by court order.[122][123][124][125]
In 2017, Burr said of Trump's [[Dismissal of James Comey|firing]] of FBI Director [[James Comey]], "I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order."[126]
As chair of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], Burr led that chamber's investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].[60] In March 2017, Comey briefed congressional leaders and Intelligence Committee heads on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election.
That briefing included "an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation." The [[Mueller report]] found that Burr had then corresponded with the Trump White House a week later about the Russia probes, with the [[White House Counsel]]'s office, led by [[Don McGahn]], apparently receiving "information about the status of the FBI investigation."[127]
In December 2019, amid an [[Impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump|impeachment inquiry into Trump]] over the [[2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal|Trump–Ukraine scandal]] (Trump's request that Ukraine announce an investigation into his political rival [[Joe Biden]]), Burr pushed the [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal|debunked conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.
Burr said, "There's no difference in the way Russia put their feet, early on, on the scale—being for one candidate and everybody called it meddling—and how the Ukrainian officials did it."[128] During [[First impeachment trial of Donald Trump|Trump's first impeachment trial]], Burr said he would oppose removing Trump from office even if a [[Quid pro quo|quid pro quo]] was confirmed.[129] He opposed calling Trump's former National Security Adviser [[John Bolton]] as a witness at the Senate trial; Bolton had written that Trump had tied U.S. security aid to Ukraine to the country's taking action against Biden.[129] Burr voted to acquit Trump on the two charges of [[Obstruction of Congress|obstruction of Congress]] and [[Abuse of power|abuse of power]].[31]

In early February 2020, just before the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] market crash, Burr sold more than $1.6 million of stock in 33 transactions during a period when, as head of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]], he was being briefed daily regarding potential health threats from COVID-19.[133][134][135] He sold 95% of the holdings in his Individual Retirement Account (IRA).[136] According to the FBI, Burr's sales six days before "a dramatic and substantial" downturn in the stock market allowed him to profit more than $164,000 and avoid $87,000 in losses.[136] The stocks sold included several considered vulnerable to economic downturns, such as hotel chains.[134] Burr's brother-in-law Gerald Fauth also subsequently sold stocks; according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Burr had a 50-second phone conversation with Fauth in February 2020, immediately after which Fauth sold shares.[137][133]
On March 19, before Burr's stock trades were publicly known, [[NPR]] reported Burr had warned a private organization in North Carolina on February 27 about the dangers of the virus, likely containment steps, and their extreme economic impacts on stocks and businesses, just two weeks after the stock sale.[138] The advice contradicted his comments in a [[Fox News]] op-ed with [[Lamar Alexander]] on February 7.
Later on March 19, the nonprofit investigative organization [[ProPublica]] broke news of Burr's stock transactions.[140] When asked for comment, a spokesperson first "express[ed] displeasure with NPR's earlier characterizations” of the February 27 Tar Heel Circle event, and later added, "As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy."[139] The [[Raleigh News & Observer]] editorial board criticized Burr's conduct: "Burr had a clear grasp of the danger ahead.
Why didn’t Burr provide his assessment to all the constituents he is supposed to serve, as well as the national media?"[141] Fox News pundit [[Tucker Carlson]] called for Burr's resignation in the face of the allegations.[142]
The [[Department of Justice]], in coordination with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], launched a formal probe into the stock sales made during the early days of the coronavirus epidemic by several legislators, including Burr.[143] Burr was also sued by a shareholder for alleged STOCK Act violations.[144][145]
The FBI's search warrant affidavit was partially unsealed in September 2022, after litigation by the [[Los Angeles Times]] and the [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]].[136]
Burr was one of only three senators to oppose the [[STOCK Act]] of 2012, which prohibits members of Congress and congressional staff from [[Insider trading|using nonpublic information in securities trading]].[134]
On May 28, 2021, Burr abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]].[148]
In 2025, Burr introduced [[Tulsi Gabbard]] at her confirmation hearing to be [[Director of National Intelligence]], his first visit to the Capitol since his term ended.[150]
Burr's car, a 1973 [[Volkswagen Thing]], is "something of a local celebrity" on Capitol Hill.[151] Burr has a known aversion to reporters, once even climbing out of his office window while carrying his dry cleaning to avoid them.[60] Burr is a member of the [[United Methodist Church]].[152]
Burr has been married to Brooke Fauth Burr, a real estate agent, since 1984, and they have two sons, Tyler and William.[153][6] Both work for tobacco companies.[154] He is a distant relative of 19th century vice-president [[Aaron Burr]], as a descendant of one of Aaron Burr's brothers.[155]
