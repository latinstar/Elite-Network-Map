[[GRU (Soviet Union)]] served as the foreign military intelligence agency for the [[General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces]] until 1991, and briefly for the newly established [[Russian Federation]] until its dissolution in May 1992, at which point the [[Russian GRU]] assumed its functions.
Its earliest predecessor, the [[Registration Directorate (Registrupravlenie, or RU)]], was established in October 1918 under the sponsorship of [[Leon Trotsky]], civilian leader of the [[Red Army]], with the secret order signed by [[Jukums Vācietis]] and [[Ephraim Sklyansky]].
The [[RU]] evolved in its organizational structure, initially not subordinate to the [[Red Army Field Staff]], but later becoming the [[Second (Intelligence) Directorate of the Red Army Staff]] (known as [[Razvedupr]]) by 1921, which positioned it as the primary source of foreign intelligence for the [[Soviet leadership]].
Further reorganization around 1925-1926 saw the [[RU]] become the [[Fourth (Intelligence) Directorate of the Red Army Staff]] (or "[[Fourth Department]]"), a move partly aimed at diminishing [[Leon Trotsky]]'s influence within the army.
Following this reorganization, the "[[Fourth Department]]" reported directly to the [[State Defense Council (Gosudarstvennaia komissiia oborony, or GKO)]] and the [[Politburo]], bypassing the [[Red Army Staff]], with the [[GKO]] being the successor of the [[RVSR]].
[[Yan Karlovich Berzin]], a [[Latvian Communist]] and former member of the [[Cheka]], was the first head of the [[4th Directorate]] before his arrest and murder during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].
[[Joseph Stalin]] formally created the [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] in its modern form in February 1942, assigning it the task of gathering military and politically significant intelligence from outside the [[Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]). 
The [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] maintained a fierce independence from rival Soviet "internal intelligence organizations" such as the [[Cheka]], [[Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB)]], [[State Political Directorate (GPU)]], [[MGB]], [[OGPU]], [[NKVD]], [[NKGB]], [[KGB]], and the [[First Chief Directorate (PGU)]], with [[Lenin]] having specifically ordered the [[Cheka]] not to interfere with [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] operations at its creation.
Despite [[Lenin]]'s order, the [[Cheka]] infiltrated the [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] in 1919, intensifying an already severe rivalry between the two espionage agencies.
[[GRU (Soviet Union)]] operated global [[rezidenturas]] and a significant [[signals intelligence (SIGINT) station in Lourdes, Cuba]], overseeing extensive intelligence collection activities.
During the [[Cold War]], the [[GRU Sixth Directorate]] specifically handled monitoring [[Intelsat communication satellites traffic]].
Officers from the [[GRU Sixth Directorate]] visited [[North Korea]] after the capture of the [[USS Pueblo]], inspecting the vessel and receiving some of the captured equipment.
The existence of the [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] was deliberately concealed during the [[Soviet era]], though its activities were later revealed by defectors like [[Georges Agabekov]] (the first [[OGPU]] defector) and [[Walter Krivitsky]] (a senior [[Red Army intelligence officer]]).
"[[Viktor Suvorov]]" ([[Vladimir Rezun]]), a former [[GRU (Soviet Union)]] officer who defected to [[Great Britain]], further publicized the agency during [[perestroika]], claiming even the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] required security screening to enter its headquarters and that exiting the GRU was only possible through a metaphorical "Smoke Stack."
