is an American publicly traded company specializing in software platforms for data.[3] Headquartered in [[Denver]], Colorado, it was founded in 2003 by [[Peter Thiel]],[4] [[Stephen Cohen]],[5] [[Joe Lonsdale]],[6] [[Alex Karp]],[7] and Nathan Gettings.[8][9]
Palantir Gotham is an intelligence tool used by militaries and [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorism]] analysts, including the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (USIC) and [[United States Department of Defense]].
Gotham has also been used by several police departments and has been accused of being used for [[Predictive policing|predictive policing]].
Palantir CEO Alex Karp has disputed these claims.[11][12] Its [[Software as a service|software as a service]] (SaaS) is one of five offerings authorized for Mission Critical National Security Systems (IL5[13]) by the U.S. Department of Defense.[14][15] Palantir Foundry has been used for data integration and analysis by corporate clients such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Merck KGaA]], [[Airbus]], [[Wejo]], [[Lilium GmbH|Lilium]], [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]] and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].[16] Palantir Apollo is a platform to facilitate [[CD|continuous integration/continuous delivery]] (CI/CD) across all environments.[17][18]
Palantir has been criticized for its involvement in expanding [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] through [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies.[21][22] Some former employees and critics have raised concerns about its contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], which enable [[Deportation in the second Trump administration|deportations]] and the aggregation of [[Information sensitivity|sensitive data]] on Americans.[23][24] Supporters argue that Palantir does not collect or store data itself but rather provides software that helps clients analyze data they already possess, while clients retain control and rights over their own information.
Palantir was founded in 2003.[25][26][27] Thiel named the startup after the "[[Palantír|seeing stone]]" in [[Tolkien's legendarium]].
Likewise, Palantir's office locations have names from Tolkien: The Shire (Palo Alto, California), Rivendell (McLean, Virginia), and Minas Tirith (Washington, D.C.).[28] In 2013, Thiel said Palantir was a "mission-oriented company" that could apply software similar to PayPal's fraud recognition systems to "reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties".[29] Asked what the secret of its success was, Karp said that he and Thiel pursued a "classic German approach" when founding the company, influenced by the idea of overcoming opposites via the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] [[Dialectic|dialectic]].[30]
In 2004, Thiel bankrolled the creation of a prototype by PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings and [[Stanford University]] students Joe Lonsdale and [[Stephen Cohen]].
The same year, Thiel hired [[Alex Karp]], a former colleague of his from [[Stanford Law School]], as [[Chief executive officer|chief executive officer]].[31]
According to [[Gilman Louie]], head of [[In-Q-Tel]] (a venture capital corporation associated with the CIA and the intelligence community[32][33]), after Thiel recruited Karp, the two founders came to him with some ideas but no clear problem to solve.
Palantir evolved from that software when Thiel proposed the company to Karp and Cohen.[35] According to [[Wired]], in 2004, Thiel and Karp met [[John Poindexter]], a Department of Defense official who recognized their "interesting idea" and helped them gather "a legion of advocates from the most influential strata of government".
According to Karp, [[Sequoia Capital]] chairman [[Michael Moritz]] doodled through an entire meeting, and a [[Kleiner Perkins]] executive lectured the founders about the company's inevitable failure.[37][38]
According to the [[Wall Street Journal]], when Palantir was launched in 2004, other than Thiel and Karp, there were three investors, but little interest from venture capital firms, so Thiel and his venture fund largely bankrolled the initial $30 million cost.
Later In-Q-Tel invested about $2 million.[14] According to [[Techcrunch]], Palantir's $7.5 million Series A (June 2006) was led by Oakhouse Partners and its $10.5 million Series B (November 2006) was led by REV.[39] In-Q-Tel and the others did not get board seats in exchange for their support.
[[The New Republic]] describes Karp's formation of Palantir as an embrace of techno-militarism to advance American global supremacy through hard power and targeted violence.
It highlighted passages from Karp's 2025 book The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the Future of the West, where Karp described Palantir as necessary to help create a "union of the state and the software industry" to ensure American dominance by having Silicon Valley embrace the military to beat rivals such as China which he described as having less ethical constraints.[42] The Wall Street Journal described Palantir as having a "pro-America ethos" from its conception, highlighting a 2025 fellowship where fellows received a four-week seminar on [[Western civilization]] and whether it was worth defending.[43]
In its early years its work included a subprime lender study for [[Center for Public Integrity]] and analyses of Somali piracy, Hezbollah, and the platform used to detect the Chinese [[GhostNet]].[44] Palantir said computers alone using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] could not defeat an adaptive adversary.
Instead, it proposed using human analysts to explore data from many sources, called [[Intelligence amplification|intelligence augmentation]].[45]
Journalist Whitney Webb, who is noted for her investigative work on [[Jeffrey Epstein]],[46] has written that Palantir's origin was the Pentagon's "Total Awareness Program" and that Palantir is a CIA front.
She also links Palantir and Thiel to the CIA, [[Mossad]], and the Epstein network's alleged plan to create "an Orwellian nightmare".
She has published these theories on the Chinese version of [[MintPress News]], a far-left site known for being part of the "Russian web of disinformation",[47][48][49] and through Trineday, a publisher found by the conspiracy theorist[50] Kris Millegan.[51][52][53] The [[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] describes Webb as a MintPress journalist.[54]
In April 2010, Palantir announced a partnership with [[Thomson Reuters]] to sell the Palantir Metropolis product as "QA Studio" (a [[Quantitative research|quantitative analysis]] tool).[55] On June 18, 2010, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] and [[Office of Management and Budget]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] held a press conference at the [[White House]] announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus by the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] (RATB).
Biden credited the success to the software, Palantir, being deployed by the federal government.[56] He announced that the capability would be deployed at other government agencies, starting with [[Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].[57][58][59][60]
A document leaked to [[TechCrunch]] revealed that Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least 12 groups in the U.S. government, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], the [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], the [[West Point|United States Military Academy]], the [[Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization]] and Allies, the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].
At the time, the [[United States Army]] continued to use its own data analysis tool.[62] Also according to TechCrunch, U.S. spy agencies such as the CIA and FBI were linked for the first time with Palantir software, as their databases had previously been [[Information silo|siloed]].[62]
In September 2013, Palantir disclosed over $196 million in funding, according to a U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] filing.[63][64] It was estimated that the company would likely sign almost $1 billion in contracts in 2014.[65] CEO [[Alex Karp]] announced in 2013 that the company would not pursue an [[IPO]], as going public would make "running a company like ours very difficult."[66] In December 2013, the company began a round of financing, raising around $450 million from private funders.
This raised the company's value to $9 billion, according to [[Forbes]], with the magazine reporting that the valuation made Palantir "among Silicon Valley's most valuable private technology companies."[66]
In December 2014, Forbes reported that Palantir was looking to raise $400 million in an additional round of financing, after the company filed paperwork with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the month before.
If completed, Forbes said Palantir's funding could reach $1.2 billion.[66] As of December 2014, the company continued to have diverse private funders, [[Ken Langone]] and [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], [[In-Q-Tel]] of the CIA,[67] [[Tiger Global Management]], and [[Founders Fund]], a venture firm operated by Thiel.[66]
Palantir was valued at $15 billion in November 2014.[68] In June 2015, [[BuzzFeed]] reported the company was raising up to $500 million in new capital at a valuation of $20 billion.[69] By December, it had raised a further $880 million, while the company was still valued at $20 billion.[70] In February 2016, Palantir bought Kimono Labs, a startup that makes it easy to collect information from public-facing websites.[71]
In August 2016, Palantir acquired [[Data visualization|data visualization]] startup Silk.[72]
In 2017, [[BuzzFeed News]] reported that despite the reputation that connected Palantir to U.S. intelligence agencies (which Palantir deliberately crafted to help it win business), including the CIA, NSA, and FBI, the actual relationship was rocky for various reasons, with episodes of friction and recalcitrance.
The NSA, in particular, had been resistant because it had plenty of its own talent and focused more on [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] while Palantir's software worked better for [[Human intelligence|HUMINT]].
Palantir was one of four large technology firms[75] to start working with the [[NHS]] on supporting [[COVID-19]] efforts through the provision of software from Palantir Foundry,[76] and by April 2020, several countries had used Palantir's technology to track and contain the contagion.[77] Palantir also developed Tiberius, a software for vaccine allocation used in the United States.[78]
In August 2020, Palantir Technologies moved its headquarters to [[Denver, Colorado]], distancing itself from the "engineering elite of Silicon Valley [...] they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires".[79] In September it had its [[IPO]] on the [[NYSE]],[80] advertising a goal of becoming the "default operating system across the US".[81] In December 2020, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] awarded Palantir a $44.4 million contract, boosting its shares by about 21%.[82]
In 2025, [[Fortune]] noted that it was too small to make Fortune 500, yet it has become a top 25 valuable company.
As of May 2025,[update] the second Trump administration had spent $113 million on existing and new contracts with the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and [[The Pentagon]] plus a contract of $795 million with the DOD, while deliberating contracts for the [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].[24]
The company was valued at $9 billion in December 2013 after raising an additional $107.5 million in funding.[87] [[Forbes]] wrote that the valuation made Palantir "among Silicon Valley's most valuable private technology companies".[66] Palantir's valuation rose to $15 billion after a $50 million round of funding in November 2014,[88] and to $20 billion in late 2015 as the company closed an $880 million round of funding.[89] In 2018, [[Morgan Stanley]] valued the company at $6 billion.[90]
On October 18, 2018, [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that Palantir considered an IPO in the first half of 2019 following a $41 billion valuation.[91]
In July 2020, it filed for an IPO,[92] and on September 30, 2020, it went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] through a [[Direct public offering|direct public offering]] under the ticker symbol "PLTR".[93]
On September 6, 2024, [[S&P Global]] announced that Palantir would be added to the [[S&P 500|S&P 500 index]].
On November 14, 2024, Palantir announced transfer of its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the [[Nasdaq|Nasdaq Global Select Market]], effective November 26.
As of 2021, the company had invested over $400 million into nearly two dozen [[Special-purpose acquisition company|special-purpose acquisition company]] (SPAC) targets according to investment bank [[RBC Capital Markets]], while bringing alongside those companies as customers.[98]
It is an evolution of Palantir's longstanding work in the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and is used by intelligence and defense agencies.
Foreign customers include the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|Ukrainian military]].[99] Palantir Gotham has also been used as a [[Predictive policing|predictive policing]] system, which has elicited some controversy over racism in their AI analytics.[100]
[[NHS England]] also used Foundry in dealing with the [[COVID-19 pandemic in England|COVID-19 pandemic]] to analyze the operation of the vaccination program.
In June 2021, Foxglove, a tech-justice nonprofit, started a campaign against the company because "Their background has generally been in contracts where people are harmed, not healed." Supporting the campaign, [[Clive Lewis MP]] said Palantir had an "appalling track record".[101]
As of 2022,[update] Foundry was also used for the administration of the UK [[Homes for Ukraine]] program[102] to give caseworkers employed by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] access to data held by the [[Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities]] and [[Home Office]].
In November 2023, [[NHS England]] awarded Palantir a 7-year contract for a federated data platform to access data from different systems through a single system, worth £330 million, criticized by the [[British Medical Association]], [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors Association UK]] and cybersecurity professionals.[103][104][105] In 2024, medical professionals picketed outside NHS England HQ, demanding cancellation of the deal.[106]
As of May 2025, four US federal agencies, including the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], used Foundry.[24]
For example, in 2014, it premiered Insightics, which according to the [[Wall Street Journal]] "extracts customer spending and demographic information from merchants' [[Credit history|credit-card records]]".
It was created in tandem with credit processing company [[First Data]].[107]
In April 2023, the company launched Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which integrates [[Large language model|large language models]] into privately operated networks.
The company demonstrated its use in war, where a military operator could deploy operations and receive responses via an AI [[Chatbot|chatbot]].[108][109] Citing potential risks of [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative artificial intelligence]], Karp said the product would not let the AI independently carry out targeting operations, but would require human oversight.[110][111] Commercial companies have also used AIP across many domains.
AIP lets users create LLMs called "agents" through a [[Graphical user interface|graphical user interface]].
Agents can interact with a digital representation of a company's business known as an [[Ontology|ontology]].
After being prototyped with [[Federal Acquisition Regulation#Independent research and development|IRAD]] funds, the project is now developed in partnership with [[Anduril Industries]], [[Northrop Grumman]], and other contractors.
The company claims that TITAN can improve customers' ability to conduct long-range precision strikes.[116] Palantir is under contract to deliver 10 units to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].[117]
MetaConstellation is a [[Satellite constellation|satellite network]] that supports the deployment of AI models.
MetaConstellation has been used by customers including the [[United States Northern Command]].[118]
Contents include battery packs, a ruggedized laptop with company software, and a [[Quadcopter|quadcopter]] supporting [[Computer vision|computer vision]] applications.
Palantir Metropolis (formerly known as Palantir Finance) was[122] software for [[Data integration|data integration]], [[Information management|information management]], and quantitative [[Analytics|analytics]].
The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and [[Public data|public data]] sets and discovers trends, relationships, and anomalies, including [[Predictive analytics|predictive analytics]].[123] Aided by 120 "forward-deployed engineers" of Palantir in 2009, Peter Cavicchia III of JPMorgan used Metropolis to monitor employee communications[124] and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed signs of potential disgruntlement: the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel.[123][124] The Metropolis team used emails, download activity, browser histories, and GPS locations from JPMorgan-owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search, aggregate, sort, and analyze this information for specific keywords, phrases, and patterns of behavior.[123][124] In 2013, Cavicchia may have shared this information with [[Frank Bisignano]], who had become CEO of [[First Data Corporation]].[123] Palantir Metropolis was succeeded by Palantir Foundry.[125]
Palantir Foundry clients include [[Merck KGaA]],[130] [[Airbus]],[131] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].[132]
Palantir partner [[Information Warfare Monitor]] used Palantir software to uncover both the [[Ghostnet]] and the [[Shadow Network]].[128][133][134]
Palantir's software was used by the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]].
Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets to better screen the entities receiving stimulus funds.[59] Other clients as of 2019 included [[Polaris Project]],[135] the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]],[62] the [[National Institutes of Health]],[136] [[Team Rubicon]],[137] and the United Nations [[World Food Programme]].[138]
In October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] vaccines across the country.[139]
Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the [[United States Intelligence Community]] and [[United States Department of Defense]], fraud investigators at the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]], and cyber analysts at [[Information Warfare Monitor]] (responsible for the [[GhostNet]] and the [[Shadow Network]] investigation).
Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]], a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015.
Other clients as of 2013 included [[DHS]], [[NSA]], [[FBI]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], [[West Point]], the [[Joint IED Defeat Organization]] and Allies.
However, at the time the [[United States Army]] continued to use its own data analysis tool.[62] Also, according to [[TechCrunch]], "The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to [[Database integration|connect databases]] across departments.
Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and [[FBI]] were [[Information silo|siloed]], forcing users to search each database individually.
U.S. [[Military intelligence|military intelligence]] used the Palantir product to improve its ability to predict locations of [[Improvised explosive devices|improvised explosive devices]] in its [[War in Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]].
A small number of practitioners reported it was more useful than the United States Army's [[Program of Record]], the [[Distributed Common Ground System]] (DCGS-A).
Hunter]] complained of [[United States Department of Defense]] obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[140]
Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial [[License plate|license plates]] database for California.[141] In 2012 [[New Orleans Police Department]] partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.[142]
In 2014, [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and [[Illegal immigrant|illegal immigrants]].
Palantir took over the Pentagon's [[Project Maven]] contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.[144]
The [[Department of Government Efficiency]] has asked Palantir to help it speed up deportation by creating a master database.[146]
Palantir has contracts relating to patient data from England's [[National Health Service]].
[[Liam Fox]] encouraged the firm "to expand their software business" in Britain.[150] It was said to be "critical to the success of the vaccination and PPE programmes", but its involvement with the NHS was controversial among civil liberties groups.[151] Conservative MP [[David Davis]] called for a judicial review into the sharing of patient data with Palantir.[152]
The procurement of a £480m [[Federated database system|Federated Data Platform]] by [[NHS England]], launched in January 2023, has been called a "must win" for Palantir.[153] The procurement has been called a "farce" by civil liberties campaigners who allege that Palantir has a competitive advantage as it "already has its feet under the table in NHS England" and benefits from a short procurement window.[154] In April 2023 it was revealed that a consortium of UK companies had unsuccessfully bid for the contract.[155]
Labour peer and former Health Minister [[Philip Hunt, Baron Hunt of Kings Heath|Philip Hunt]] voiced his concern about Palantir's use of data, saying, "The current NHS and current government doesn't have a good track record of getting the details right, and the procurement shows no sign of going better."[156]
In January 2023, Thiel called Britain's affection for the NHS "[[Stockholm syndrome|Stockholm Syndrome]]" during a speech to the [[Oxford Union]], adding that the NHS "makes people sick".
In March 2023, it was revealed that NHS hospitals had been ordered to share patient data with Palantir, prompting renewed criticism from civil liberties groups, including for supporting genocide, privacy and security practices, and "buying their way in".[104][158] Groups including the [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors' Association UK]], [[National Pensioners Convention|National Pensioners' Convention]], and Just Treatment subsequently threatened legal action over NHS England's procurement of the FDP contract, citing concerns over the use of patient data.[159]
In 2022, Palantir recruited [[NHS England]]'s former artificial intelligence chief, Indra Joshi.
It said it was planning to increase its team in the UK by 250.[160] Palantir's UK head, Louis Mosley, grandson of the late [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]],[161] was quoted internally as saying that Palantir's strategy for entry into the British health industry was to "Buy our way in" by acquiring smaller rival companies with existing relationships with the NHS in order to "take a lot of ground and take down a lot of political resistance".[162]
In April 2024, medical professionals picketed at NHS England headquarters, demanding that it end its contract with Palantir over contracts with the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].[106]
[[Europol]] has used the Gotham system.[100]
Other arguments were concerned with Thiel's politics in the U.S., Palantir's association with American and other European intelligence services (Jacob Kaarsbo, a former chief analyst at [[Danish Defence Intelligence Service]], could not name these intelligence services for reasons of confidentiality), and the security risk posed by giving Palantir citizens' data.
The [[Police of Denmark|Danish National Police]] answered with a reference to a 2021 response to the [[Folketing]], but otherwise, the Police, the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]], and Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard refused to comment on the matter.[164][165][166]
Known inputs are prefiled freight documents, passenger lists, the national Currency Exchange database (tracks all cross-border currency exchanges), the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administrations]] employer- and employee-registry, the Norwegian stock holder registry and 30 public databases from InfoTorg.
In 2023, German interior minister [[Nancy Faeser]] stopped the federal use of Palantir.[168] As of July 2025, [[German police]] departments in three of its 16 states—[[Bavaria]], [[Hesse]], and [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]]—have used Palantir for data mining.
In March, [[Baden-Württemberg]] entered a $25 million contract without a legal basis to use the software.[169]
In France, after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], the Directorate-General for Internal Security signed a contract with Palantir, which was extended in 2019.[170] President [[Emmanuel Macron]] said Palantir would retain its role in the French intelligence sector until the end of his term in office, but a replacement program was launched in May 2017.[171]
Karp claims to have been the first CEO of a large U.S. company to have visited Ukraine after the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|2022 Russian invasion]].[172] Palantir's technology has since been used close to the front lines.[173] It is used to shorten the "[[Kill chain|kill chain]]" in [[Russo-Ukrainian War]].[174] According to a December 2022 report by [[The Times]], Palantir's AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed, and deadliness of its artillery strikes.[175] [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Ukraine's prosecutor general's office]] also plans to use Palantir's software to help document alleged [[War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian war crimes]].[176]
In 2025, Justice minister [[David van Weel]] confirmed that Dutch police had used Palantir since 2011.
Director-general of police (and later prime minister) [[Dick Schoof]] participated in the purchase of the software.
Palantir's London office was the target of demonstrations by [[Gaza war protests in the United Kingdom|pro-Palestine protesters]] in December 2023 after it was awarded a large contract to manage NHS data.
The protesters accused Palantir of being "complicit" in [[Israeli war crimes in the Gaza war]] because it provides the [[Israel Defence Force]] (IDF) with intelligence and surveillance services, including a form of [[Predictive policing|predictive policing]].[111] In January 2024, Palantir agreed to a strategic partnership with the IDF under which it would provide the IDF with services to assist its "war-related missions".[178] Karp has been emphatic in his public support for Israel.
In 2024, Irish politician and former Palantir employee [[Eoin Hayes]] was suspended by his party, the [[Social Democrats]], for saying at a press conference that he had sold shares in Palantir before he entered politics, when he had sold the shares a month after being elected as a city councillor.
Later that day, Hayes corrected the date in a statement.[180] He issued a further clarifying statement after his suspension that evening.[181] Hayes worked for Palantir between 2015 and 2017 but denied having any role relating to military contracts.[182] The Social Democrats have been some of the most vocal critics of the [[Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip]] and Hayes has been accused by a rival politician of "profiting from genocide".[183]
In May 2025, a pro-Palestinian protest was held in Denver against Congressman [[Jason Crow]] for repeatedly accepting campaign donations from Palantir.[184]
Palantir Gotham was used by cyber analysts at [[Information Warfare Monitor]], a Canadian public-private venture that operated from 2003 to 2012.[185][186][187][better source needed]
Palantir was used by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] to verify if Iran was in compliance with the [[Iran nuclear deal framework|2015 agreement]].[67]
Palantir's partnership with [[Anduril Industries]] extends to many areas.
In later 2024, there were reportedly building and leading a consortium with another dozen contractors, including [[SpaceX]], [[OpenAI]], and Saronic, to challenge the domination of the traditional "primes".[188][189] They also partner with EVTOL company [[Archer Aviation]].[190]
Alongside [[8VC]] and [[General Catalyst]], Palantir also helped to create and is a member of the New American Industrial Alliance.[191][192] The other members are other defense contractors and hardtech companies, such as Anduril, [[Andreessen Horowitz]], Hadrian, [[Oklo Inc.]], Narya Capital, [[Booz Allen]], [[Joby Aviation]], Regent Craft, Atomic Industries, Impulse Space, and Dirac, which hope to reduce government regulations.[193][194]
Palantir, [[TWG Global]], and [[XAI|xAI]] have a joint venture.[195] Palantir also collaborates with [[Anthropic]] and [[Amazon Web Services]] to provide Anthropic's [[Claude]] AI models to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies.[196]
Palantir also partners with the traditional defense "primes": [[Boeing]] (specifically its defense and space unit),[197] [[Lockheed Martin]],[198] [[Northrop Grumman]] (TITAN system),[199] and [[General Dynamics]] (through General Dynamics Land System).[200]
Palantir is known to disrupt the traditional consulting business model.[201][202] But it also partners with traditional companies (and rivals in government contract) like [[Deloitte]], Booz Allen, and [[Accenture]].[203][204][205]
On February 8, 2021, Palantir and [[IBM]] announced a partnership that would use [[IBM]]'s hybrid cloud data platform alongside Palantir's operations platform for building applications.
The product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is expected to simplify the process of building and deploying AI-integrated applications with [[IBM Watson]].[206]

In Korea, Palantir has strategic relationships with [[HD Hyundai Heavy Industries|HD Huyndai]] and [[KT Corporation|KT]].
[[SAP]] has strategic partnerships with Palantir and [[Perplexity]], aiming to enhance SAP's business AI offerings.[215] Palantir also partners with SAP's U.S.-based branch, SAP National Security Services, to offer AI systems to the U.S. public sector.[216]
Palantir has a partnership with [[Axel Springer SE]],[217][218] a publisher known to have a close relationship with Karp, who sat on its board,[219] and Thiel, who employed Springer's [[Mathias Döpfner]]'s son Moritz as his chief of staff and business associate.
German media have alleged that Thiel intends for Moritz Döpfner to become "the German [[JD Vance]]".[220]
Palantir partners with [[Merck KGaA]] through joint ventures Syntrophy, which focuses on cancer data analytics, and Athinia, which focuses on the semiconductor sector.[221][222]
Palantir is strategic partners with [[Helsing]].[223] [[Espreso TV]] has linked the unusual number of defense CEOs (Brian Schimpf of Anduril Industries, Gundbert Scherf of Helsing, and Karp) at the [[2025 Bilderberg Conference]] to Thiel's influence.[224]
On 4 November 2025, a joint venture between Palantir and [[Dubai Holding]], the Dubai government’s investment arm, was announced.
[[The New Arab]] noted that the partnership came just a day after Microsoft revealed plans to invest $15.2 billion in AI and cloud computing projects across the UAE.[225]
Palantir has been criticized for its role in expanding [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition software]].[21][22] Some former employees and critics say the company's contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|second Trump Administration]], which enable [[Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump|deportations]] and the aggregation of [[Information sensitivity|sensitive data]] on Americans across [[Government agency|administrative agencies]], are problematic.[23][24] Others observe that Palantir does not collect or store data, but only helps analyze data that customers have already collected and provides services and platforms where customers retain the rights.
Incidents of data leaks or mismanagement have been noted, including the 2015 data leak in which Techcrunch received documents that revealed the tools used by Palantir and a list of key customers;[230] the 2021 software misconfiguration that allowed some FBI employees unwarranted access (which, according to Palantir, was because the end user did not follow the protocols);[231] and the 2025 lawsuit Palantir filed against former employees Radha Jain and Joanna Cohen for stealing data in order to launch a "copycat" company with the help of [[General Catalyst]] (the two engineers had been entrusted with the source code and Cohen was noted to have interacted with Palantir's important customers).[232]
Asahi Shimbun wrote, "While Palantir works to protect the U.S. and its allies from Islamist terrorism and infringement on freedoms by authoritarian states, there is also concern that Palantir's software can be perverted by governments to surveil the public or curtail civil liberties."[233] The tech writer Karl Montevirgen wrote in [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "Palantir stands as one of the most consequential and controversial data analytics firms of the early 21st century.
[[I2 Group|i2 Inc]] sued Palantir in Federal Court, alleging fraud, conspiracy, and copyright infringement over Palantir's algorithm.
Shyam Sankar, Palantir's director of business development, used a [[Private investigator|private eye]] company known as the [[Cutout|cutout]] for obtaining i2's code.
In 2010, [[Hunton & Williams]] LLP allegedly asked Berico Technologies, Palantir, and [[HBGary Federal]] to draft a response plan to "the [[WikiLeaks]] Threat." In early 2011 [[Anonymous]] publicly released HBGary-internal documents, including the plan.
The plan proposed that Palantir software would "serve as the foundation for all the data collection, integration, analysis, and production efforts."[235] The plan also included slides, allegedly authored by HBGary CEO Aaron Barr, which suggested "[spreading] disinformation" and "disrupting" [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s support for WikiLeaks.[236]
Palantir CEO [[Alex Karp]] ended all ties to [[HBGary]] and issued a statement apologizing to "progressive organizations ...
On September 26, 2016, the [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs]] of the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] filed a lawsuit against Palantir alleging that the company discriminated against Asian job applicants on the basis of their race.[237] According to the lawsuit, the company "routinely eliminated" Asian applicants during the hiring process, even when they were "as qualified as white applicants" for the same jobs.[238] Palantir settled the suit in April 2017 for $1.7 million while not admitting wrongdoing.[239]
During questioning in front of the [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee|Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee]], [[Christopher Wylie]], the former research director of [[Cambridge Analytica]], said that several meetings had taken place between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica, and that Alexander Nix, the chief executive of [[SCL Group|SCL]], had facilitated their use of [[Aleksandr Kogan]]'s data which had been obtained from his app "thisisyourdigitallife" by mining personal surveys.
Palantir has come under criticism due to its partnership developing software for [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE).
But documents obtained in 2017 by [[The Intercept]][143] show that this is not true.
Other groups critical of Palantir include the [[Brennan Center for Justice]],[243] National Immigration Project,[244] the Immigrant Defense Project,[245] the [[Tech Workers Coalition]], and [[Mijente]].[246] In one internal ICE report Mijente acquired, it was revealed that Palantir's software was critical in an operation to arrest the parents of children residing illegally.[247]
In September 2020, [[Amnesty International]] released a report criticizing Palantir's failure to conduct [[Human rights due diligence|human rights due diligence]] for its contracts with ICE.
Palantir's human rights record was being scrutinized for contributing to [[Human rights violations|human rights violations]] of [[Asylum-seekers|asylum-seekers]] and [[Economic migrant|migrants]].[248][249]
In 2025, Palantir was reported to be working closely with ICE to enable [[Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump|deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump]].[250]
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] prompted tech companies to respond to growing demand for citizen information from governments in order to conduct contact tracing and to analyze patient data.[251] Consequently, data collection companies such as Palantir had been contracted to partake in pandemic data collection practices.
Palantir's participation in "HHS Protect Now", a program launched by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to track the spread of the coronavirus, attracted criticism from US lawmakers.[252]
After employee protests in June 2018, [[Google]] chose not to renew its contract with the US [[Department of Defense]] to work on [[Project Maven]], a program to develop artificial intelligence that can analyze video feeds from aerial drones; Palantir took over the project in December 2019.[144] Google employees were concerned that the technology could lead to [[Lethal autonomous weapon|lethal autonomous weapons]] that choose targets without human input.[144]
According to required financial disclosures, [[Stephen Miller]], who as [[Homeland Security Advisor|United States homeland security advisor]] has been actively involved in the [[Second Trump administration|second Trump administration]]'s deportation efforts, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of Palantir stock; some Trump critics have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest.[253][254][255] Similar financial disclosure requirements of U.S. government employees show that at least 10 other members of the Trump administration own Palantir stock.[256] Advocacy groups such as the [[Alliance for Secure AI]] have also criticized Palantir's use of AI during the second Trump administration.[257][258]
The controversy also elicits debate from neighboring countries, with [[De Tijd]] noting that even when a German court ruled the software unconstitutional in 2023, it was not abandoned, and the law was changed.[259][260][170]
The controversy also touches on Thiel's and Karp's German origins and alleged relationships with powerful political and economic actors in Germany (especially in the wealthier, more powerful states, such as [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and [[Hesse]]).[261][262] Hesse is Thiel's home state (he was born in Frankfurt), and Karp completed his PhD there.[263][264] Hesse was the first federal state to introduce Palantir software (as Hessendata, since 2017[265]) while Bavaria promotes its VeRA version at the federal level.
Bavaria Minister of the Interior [[Joachim Herrmann]] has said that VeRA must be used nationwide to "create a uniform and effective security infrastructure".[266]
There is also debate about the founders' application of the philosophy of [[René Girard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Carl Schmitt]], and the [[Frankfurt School]] at Palantir and in the surveillance industry.[267][268][269][270][271][272]
According to a 2025 documentary produced by [[Hessischer Rundfunk]], Karp, like Thiel, seeks world domination.[273] Franz-Josef Hanke, a spokesperson for the [[Humanist Union]] in Hesse, has also said that this is Thiel's goal with Palantir.[274]
The German version of the Marxist[275] publication [[Jacobin]] has written that while Palantir does not steal data or carry out surveillance activity, its increased power in Germany is still worrisome, considering the founders' non-democratic tendencies, and that [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[The Greens|Alliance 90/The Greens]] also carry responsibility.[276] [[The European]] has written that Thiel and Karp cause themselves trouble by trying to creating a mysterious aura, which leads to a negative reaction to Palantir software despite its usefulness in civilian and defense applications.[277]
According to an August 2025 [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] article, a [[YouGov]] poll on behalf of the SZ Dossier found that a slim majority of Germans support federal agencies' use of Palantir: 51% of respondents partly or completely supported it, 30% partly or completely opposed it, and 19% did not give a response.[278] Nevertheless, civil skepticism of the company and software remains prominent; a petition on the platform Campact gathered 84,000 signatures against Palantir within a few hours and has more than 400,000 as of September 2025.[279][280][281]
As of December 2024,[update] the [[Board of directors|board of directors]] of Palantir includes:[282]

The Class F shares, totaling 1,005,000, are managed by the Founder Voting Trust and owned equally by the three founders Thiel, Karp, and Cohen, which ensures them a 49.99% voting interest regardless of the number of other shares they hold or the number of new shares the company issues.[313][314][315] In response to criticism that the founders wanted to remain "emperors for life", they said the creation of the Class F shares did not violate the law or the company charter and had been approved by a majority of other Palantir investors when the firm went public in 2020.[316] In 2025, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] wrote:
