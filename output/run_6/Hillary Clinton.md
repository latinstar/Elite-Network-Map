A member of the [[Democratic Party]], she was the party's nominee in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party and the only woman to win the popular vote for U.S. president.
However, she lost the electoral college to [[Republican Party]] nominee [[Donald Trump]].
In 1977, Clinton co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]], and in 1979 she became the first woman partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm.
As a senator, she chaired the [[Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee]] from 2003 to 2007.

Following her loss, she wrote multiple books and launched [[Onward Together]], a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[23][24] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley [[Young Republicans]].[25][26] As the leader of this "Rockefeller Republican"-oriented group,[27] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[28] She later stepped down from this position.
To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]], and she attended the "Wellesley in Washington" summer program.[32] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[32] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach.
In the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student [[Bill Clinton]].
In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[82][83] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[76] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[84] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[45] while working pro bono in child advocacy.[85] In 1977, Rodham cofounded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]], a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[45][86]
She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[118][120][121] According to the journalist Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for [[Donald Trump]].[122][123]
In May 2017, Clinton announced the formation of [[Onward Together]], a new political action committee that she wrote is "dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election".[462] Clinton has also made occasional comments on political issues in the time since losing her presidential campaign,[463] and authored several op-eds.[464][465][466]
Mark Landler, writing in The New York Times, called Clinton a "Hawk" and claimed that her foreign policy platform was to the right of Republicans like [[Donald Trump]] and Ted Cruz.[507] Clinton's foreign policy positions have also been supported by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Jim Inhofe.[508] Clinton As a Senator, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[509] a vote she later said she regretted.[510] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[511] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[512][513] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[506] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival."[514] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[515][516] In a 2017 interview, after a poison gas attack in Syria, Clinton said that she had favored more aggressive action against Bashar al-Assad: "I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad.
