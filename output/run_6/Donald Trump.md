A member of the [[Republican Party]], he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.
Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against [[Democratic Party]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].
After losing the 2020 presidential election to [[Joe Biden]], Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021.
After winning the 2024 presidential election against then-Vice President [[Kamala Harris]], he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two felony indictments against him for retention of classified documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without prejudice.
Four years later, the Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree.[35] Helping Trump projects,[36] Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.[37] In 1979, Cohn introduced political consultant [[Roger Stone]] to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[38]
Trump moved from his studio to a penthouse with a view and got a real estate broker's license in the mid-1970s.[39] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win.[40] Over three decades as of 2018, Trump had been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits,[41] liens, and other filings, often filed for nonpayment against him by employees, contractors, real estate brokers, and his own attorneys.[42] Between 1991 and 2009, Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the [[Plaza Hotel]] in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the [[Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts]] company.[43][44]
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict [[Grand Hyatt New York|Commodore Hotel]], adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[47] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[48][49] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the [[Grand Hyatt New York|Grand Hyatt Hotel]],[50] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop [[Trump Tower]], a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[51] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.[52] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks.[53] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[54]
Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South.[58] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use [[Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago, which opened in 2008.
In 2024, [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)#Tax deductions|The New York Times and ProPublica reported]] that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[59]
In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[60] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[61] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump's Castle.[62][63] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[64] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the [[Trump Taj Mahal]].
Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[65] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the [[Trump Shuttle]] airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[66] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[67] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[60] He remained chairman until 2009.[68]
He renamed the airline [[Trump Shuttle]] and operated it until 1992.[82] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[83] In 1996, he purchased the [[Miss Universe]] pageants, including Miss USA and [[Miss Teen USA]].[84] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[85][86] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[87] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.[88]
In 2005, Trump cofounded [[Trump University]], a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000.
After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[93] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from [[Vince McMahon]].[94] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[95] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[93] In 2016, [[The Washington Post]] reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion.[96] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general stated the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[97] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[98] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[99] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[100] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[101]
According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[41] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[44] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[44] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[102] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of [[Deutsche Bank]], declined to lend to him.[103] After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his affiliated company in the future.[104]
Trump won the election with 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].
