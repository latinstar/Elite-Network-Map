Porter Johnston Goss (/ɡɒs/; born November 26, 1938) is an American politician who served as the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] from 2004 to 2006.
He was the last director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from 2004 to 2005, then became the first [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] following the passage of the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which abolished the DCI position and replaced it with the [[Director of National Intelligence]] on December 17, 2004.
Before taking over the CIA, Goss was a Republican member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from Florida's 14th congressional district from 1989 to 2004.
He served as Chairman of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] from 1997 to 2004, was a co-sponsor of the USA PATRIOT Act and was a co-chair of the Joint 9/11 Intelligence Inquiry.
Bush from the Oval Office.[1] On May 8, Bush nominated U.S. Air Force General [[Michael Hayden]] to be Goss's successor.
Bush, and [[John Negroponte]], who served as an ambassador for [[George H.
Bush, and as Goss's superior in the post of [[Director of National Intelligence]] from 2005 to 2006.[9] Negroponte solicited Goss's assistance, while Goss was Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to get the position as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the first term of the second Bush administration.
In his junior year at Yale, Goss was recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].
Goss was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, telling [[The Washington Post]] in 2002 that he had done some "small-boat handling" and had "some very interesting moments in the Florida Straits".
The seat was vacated by Connie Mack III when he ran successfully for the [[U.S. Senate]].
In the general election, Goss faced the former first president of [[Common Cause]], Jack T.
For instance, he supported the Kyoto Protocol and strengthening the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].
He also helped establish and served on the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security Committee]].
Meetings were held with President Pervez Musharraf and with Pakistan's military and intelligence officials including the head of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) General Mahmud Ahmed, as well as with the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, [[Abdul Salam Zaeef]].
The inquiry's final report was released in December 2002 and focused entirely on the CIA and [[FBI]]'s activities, leaving out any information on the White House's activities.
[[Ray McGovern]], a 27-year veteran of the CIA turned Democratic political activist and a frequent commentator on intelligence issues, believed the report showed that Goss gave "clear priority to providing political protection for the president" when conducting the inquiry.
As [[Newsweek]][22] and [[CNN]][23] reported, in June 2004, while Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in the face of withering attacks by the Democrats against the Bush administration in a very tightly contested presidential and congressional election year, Goss defended the intelligence community and the Administration in decidedly partisan terms.
Following the June 3, 2004, resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]], Goss was nominated to become the new director on August 10 by President George W.
Bush.[24][25] The appointment was challenged by some prominent Democrats, including former Vice President [[Al Gore]] and Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV).
Another Democratic member of the committee, [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR), expressed concerns that given Goss's history within and ties to the CIA, he would be too disinclined to push for institutional change.
In an interview carried out by [[Michael Moore]]'s production company on March 3, 2004, Goss described himself as "probably not qualified" for a job within the CIA, because the language skills the Agency now seeks are not languages he speaks and because the people applying today for positions within the CIA's four directorates have such keen technical and analytic skills, which he did not have when he applied to the Agency in the early 1960s (see below).
Republican senators unanimously backed him, along with many prominent Democrats, including the two Democratic senators from Florida, Bob Graham and [[Bill Nelson]], and Senate Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]].
His choice for the position of Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, [[Kyle Foggo]], was enveloped in an extensive procurement scandal within days of Goss's resignation.[27]
The Los Angeles Times reported: "Goss was pushed out by [[John Negroponte|Negroponte]] after clashes between them over Goss's management style, as well as his reluctance to surrender CIA personnel and resources to new organizations set up to combat terrorism and weapons proliferation."[28] Negroponte for his part had been an ambassador and a consumer of intelligence.
[[The Weekly Standard]] also noted that Goss wanted intelligence analysts to get more exposure to intelligence gathering and Negroponte planned to move them from the CIA over to [[Director of National Intelligence|DNI]], farther from intelligence gathering.
Goss was replaced by Negroponte's Principal Deputy Director for National Intelligence, four-star Air Force General [[Michael Hayden]].
[[Robert Novak]]'s May 11 column claimed "Goss faced a disintegrating CIA.
Special operations were going over to the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].
Goss is an active speaker on the lecture circuit.[31] Goss registered in April 2015 as a lobbyist representing Turkey.[32] He is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of [[Issue One]].[33] He also is an avid organic farmer.[34]
In February 16, 2016, Goss expressed his support for former Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]] in a letter to Judge Thomas M.
In October 2022, Goss joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by [[Issue One]] to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus Leader [[Dick Gephardt]] and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor [[Kerry Healey]].[37][38]
