SIS is one of the British intelligence agencies and the [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]] (known as "C") is directly accountable to the Foreign Secretary.[4]
Today, SIS is subject to public oversight by the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] and the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]].[7]
The stated priority roles of SIS are counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, providing intelligence in support of cyber security, and supporting stability overseas to disrupt terrorism and other criminal activities.[8] Unlike its main sister agencies, the [[MI5|Security Service]] (MI5) and [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), SIS works exclusively in foreign intelligence gathering; the ISA allows it to carry out operations only against persons outside the British Islands.[9] Some of SIS's actions since the 2000s have attracted significant controversy, such as its alleged complicity in acts of torture and extraordinary rendition.[10][11]
Since 1994, SIS headquarters have been in the [[SIS Building]] in London, on the South Bank of the River Thames.[12]
SIS works with the [[Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office]] and therefore falls under the supervision of the Foreign Secretary.[13]
The SIS regularly cooperates and works with [[MI5]] and [[GCHQ]] regarding domestic and cyber intelligence.[14] SIS has three primary tasks:[13]
The Foreign Secretary appoints [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service|the head of SIS]], to oversee SIS daily management and work.[18]
The [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]] has a twofold responsibility within SIS.
[[Blaise Metreweli]] has been the chief of SIS since 2024.[19]
Command and control over SIS is through four main government entities: the Central Intelligence Machinery, the Ministerial Committee on the Intelligence Services, the Permanent Secretaries' Committee on the Intelligence Services, and the [[Joint Intelligence Committee]].[20]
The [[Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) assesses the intelligence gathered by [[GCHQ]], [[MI5]], and SIS and presents it to cabinet ministers, who in turn, enable the government's policies to help achieve national security and defence.[21] The JIC also reports the intelligence analysis to the [[Cabinet Office]] itself.[20]
[[HM Treasury]] has directed the security and intelligence agencies to prepare financial statements for each financial year in accordance with the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000.[23]
Due to security concerns, the Government does not publish these financial statements, which are audited by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General]] and then shown to the chair of the [[Public Accounts Committee]] in accordance with the Intelligence Services Act 1994.[23]
During the First World War in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence]].[25]
MI6 assisted the [[Gestapo]], the Nazi secret police, with "the exchange of information about communism" as late as October 1937, well into the Nazi era; the head of the British agency's Berlin station, Frank Foley, was still able to describe his relationship with the Gestapo's so-called communism expert as "cordial".[47] In 1936, in a sign that he lacked confidence in his own agents, Sinclair founded the semi-autonomous Z section under Claude Dansey for economic intelligence about Germany.[48] Working alongside the Z section was the British Industrial Secret Service headed by a Canadian businessman living in London, William Stephenson that recruited British businessmen active in Germany for intelligence about German industrial production.[48] For intelligence on German military plans, MI6 largely depended upon Czechoslovak military intelligence from 1937 onward as Paul Thümmel, aka "Agent A-54", a senior officer in the German intelligence service, the [[Abwehr]], had been bribed into working for Czechoslovakia.[48] Thus most of what MI6 knew about German plans during both the Sudetenland crisis and the Danzig crisis came from the Czechoslovak military intelligence, which continued to run Thümmel even after the dissolution of Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and a government-in-exile was set up.[48] Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador to Germany from 1937 to 1939, was actively hostile towards MI6 running agents out of the British embassy in Berlin as he made it clear his belief that espionage against Germany would hamper the "general settlement" he was seeking with the Reich.[48] The focus on collecting intelligence on German aircraft production led MI6 to be confused about the wider strategic question of what were the aims of German foreign policy.
As such, Britain simply did not possess the military force to save the Netherlands, leading to urgent requests being made to Paris to ask if France would be willing to assist with the defence of the Netherlands.[52] In response, the French replied that Britain would need to do more for France if the British wanted the French to do something for them.[51] On 6 February 1939 in a beginning of a shift in British foreign policy, Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that "any threat to the vital interest of France" would lead to a British declaration of war.[53]  One of MI6’s most successful operations before the war started in April 1939 when an Australian businessman living in London, Sidney Cotton, who was already engaged in aerial photographic espionage for the [[Deuxième Bureau]] was recruited to fly missions over Germany.[54] Under the cover story that he was a sales agent for a dummy corporation, the Aeronautical Research and Sales Corporation, Cotton flew over Germany, Italy and the Italian colony of Libya in his Lockheed 12A aircraft, taking numerous high-quality aerial photographs of German and Italian military bases that proved immensely useful for Britain during the war.[54]
On 26 and 27 July 1939,[55] in Pyry near Warsaw,  British military intelligence representatives including Dilly Knox, Alastair Denniston and Humphrey Sandwith were introduced by their allied Polish counterparts to their [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma-decryption techniques]] and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic "Bomba", and were promised future delivery of a reverse-engineered, Polish-built duplicate Enigma machine.
Agents of the German army secret service, the [[Abwehr]], and the counter-espionage section of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), posed as high-ranking officers involved in a plot to depose Hitler.
During the Soviet–Afghan War, SIS [[United Kingdom in the Soviet-Afghan War|supported the Islamic resistance group]] commanded by Ahmad Shah Massoud and he became a key ally in the fight against the Soviets.
These included the defection to the SIS Tehran station in 1982 of KGB officer Vladimir Kuzichkin, the son of a senior Politburo member and a member of the KGB's internal Second Chief Directorate who provided SIS and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] with warning of the mobilisation of the KGB's Alpha Force during the 1991 August Coup which briefly toppled Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.[91]
As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 Intelligence Services Act.
According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction, the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of Iraq's non-conventional weapons programmes.
In March 2016, it was reported that MI6 had been involved in the Libyan Civil War since January of that year, having been escorted by the SAS to meet with Libyan officials to discuss the supplying of weapons and training for the Syrian Army and the militias fighting against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]].[113] In April 2016, it was revealed that MI6 teams with members of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment seconded to them had been deployed to Yemen to train Yemeni forces fighting AQAP, as well as identifying targets for drone strikes.[114] In November 2016, The Independent reported that MI6, MI5 and GCHQ supplied the SAS and other British special forces a list of 200 British jihadists to kill or capture before they attempt to return to the UK.
In July 2020, it was revealed that intelligence officials from a number of repressive regimes received training from senior officials of MI6 and [[MI5]].
MI6 personnel are recognised annually by King Charles III (formerly the Prince of Wales) at the Prince of Wales's Intelligence Community Awards at St James's Palace or Clarence House alongside members of the [[MI5|Security Service]] (MI5), and [[GCHQ]].[135] Awards and citations are given to teams within the agencies as well as individuals.[135]
A Year with MI6 was a public art exhibition, showing a collection of paintings and drawings by artist James Hart Dyke to mark the centenary of the Secret Intelligence Service.[136] The project saw Dyke working closely with the SIS for a year, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.[137] The Service allowed Hart Dyke access to enable him to undertake the project, sending him on hostile environment courses to allow him to work in dangerous parts of the world, and admitting him into their [[SIS Building|Vauxhall Cross headquarters]].
Since 1995, [[SIS Building|SIS headquarters]] has been at 85 Vauxhall Cross, along the Albert Embankment in Vauxhall on the south bank of the River Thames by Vauxhall Bridge, London.
A Daily Telegraph article stated that the British government opposed the filming, but this was denied by a [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|Foreign Office]] spokesperson.
