A member of the [[Republican Party]], he represented Ohio in the [[United States Senate]] from 2023 to 2025.
After briefly working as a corporate lawyer, Vance became a venture capitalist at [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Mithril Capital]].
During his tenure as vice president, he has been the finance chair of the [[Republican National Committee]].
After graduating from Middletown High School in 2003, Vance enlisted in the United States Marine Corps,[15] serving as a combat correspondent (military journalist) with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing.[16] During his four years of service, he was deployed to Iraq in 2005 for six months in a non-combat role, writing articles and taking photographs.[15] In December 2005, he was part of a group of Marines that held a roundtable discussion with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]].[17] He attained the rank of corporal, and his decorations included the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.[18]
In 2007, Vance left the military and used the G.I. Bill[19][20] to study at Ohio State University.[21] He graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude in political science and philosophy.[22] In 2010, Vance entered Yale Law School,[23] where he worked with a group of editors to check citations for The Yale Law Journal.[24] At Yale Law School, he befriended fellow Ohio native and future Republican politician [[Vivek Ramaswamy]].[25][26] During his first year, Professor [[Amy Chua]] persuaded Vance to begin writing his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.[7][27]
Vance also initiated a rapport with [[Peter Thiel]] after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.[24] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for [[David Frum]]'s "FrumForum" website under the name J.
After graduating from law school, Vance worked for Republican senator [[John Cornyn]].
He spent a year as a law clerk for Judge [[David Bunning]] of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky,[32] then worked at the law firm [[Sidley Austin]],[33] beginning a brief career as a corporate lawyer.[34] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a venture capitalist.[24] Between 2016 and 2017, he was a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, [[Mithril Capital]].[35][36]
In June 2016, Harper published Vance's book, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.[7] The memoir recounts the Appalachian culture and socioeconomic problems of Vance's upbringing.[37] Hillbilly Elegy was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] in 2016 and 2017.
The Times listed it among "6 Books to Help Understand Trump's Win",[38] and Vance was profiled in [[The Washington Post]], which called him "the voice of the Rust Belt".[39] In [[The New Republic]], Sarah Jones criticized Vance as "liberal media's favorite white trash–splainer" and a "false prophet of blue America", calling the book "little more than a list of myths about welfare queens".[40] Hillbilly Elegy's success helped propel Vance into contact with social elites, and he began writing a column for The New York Times.
Its chairman, Frederic Moll, said he hired Vance for his intelligence, legal qualifications, and connection to Thiel.[42][43] Vance tried to get [[Mithril Capital]] to invest in Circuit but Mithril passed.
Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[44] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Mithril's co-founder and managing director [[Mithril Capital#personnel|Ajay Royan]].
He decided to leave in 2017.[43] Bloomberg reports he deleted all traces of Mithril from his LinkedIn profile.[45] Vance moved back to Ohio, where he published an op-ed in [[The New York Times]] with the headline "Why I'm moving home", in which he complained about "highly educated transplants" in Silicon Valley.
In another interview, he said elite tech crowds wielded "political-financial power in combination with a certain condescension".[44] In 2017, Vance joined Revolution LLC,[46] an investment firm founded by [[Steve Case]].[46] Greenspon left Mithril and joined Vance at Revolution in 2018.[47][48] At Revolution Vance was tasked with expanding the "Rise of the Rest" initiative, which focuses on growing investments in underserved regions outside Silicon Valley and New York City.[46]
In 2019, Vance was on the board of advisors of the [[With Honor Fund]], a Super PAC that helps veterans run for office.[52] From 2020 to 2023, he was on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with Project 2025.[53][54]
In 2019, Vance and [[Chris Buskirk]] co-founded the conservative political advocacy group [[Rockbridge Network]].[55] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Marc Andreessen]].[56] In 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.[57] With Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in Rumble, a Canadian online video platform popular with the political right.[58][59]
In December 2016, Vance said he planned to move to Ohio and would consider starting a nonprofit or running for office.[60][39] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other "social ills" he had mentioned in his memoir.[61] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the advisory board members were [[Keith Humphreys]], [[Jamil Jivani]], [[Yuval Levin]], and [[Sally Satel]].[62][63] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence.[64] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements.[61][65] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's cancer diagnosis.[66][67] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent most of its revenue on overhead costs and travel.
During Vance's 2022 U.S. Senate campaign, [[Tim Ryan]], the Democratic nominee, said the charity was a front for Vance's political ambitions.
Vance denied the characterization.[69][70][b] Our Ohio Renewal's tax filings show that in its first year, it spent more (over $63,000) on "management services" provided by its executive director [[Jai Chabria]], who was Vance's top political adviser, than it did on programs to fight opioid abuse.[74][63] In 2017, Vance formed a similarly named 501(c)(3) organization, Our Ohio Renewal Foundation, which raised around $69,000 from 2017 to 2023.[68] As of September 2024, the foundation had not spent any funds since 2019.[75]
According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and a 2019 ProPublica investigation, the charity's biggest accomplishment, sending psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] to Ohio's Appalachian region for a yearlong residency in 2018, was "tainted" by the ties among Satel, her employer, [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), and [[Purdue Pharma]], in the form of knowledge exchange between Satel and Purdue and financial support from Purdue to AEI.
In early 2018, Vance considered running for the U.S. Senate against [[Sherrod Brown]],[80] but did not.[81] In March 2021, [[Peter Thiel]] gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.[82][83][84] [[Robert Mercer]] also gave an undisclosed amount.[82] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by [[Rob Portman]].[85] In May, he launched an exploratory committee.[86]
Vance announced his Senate campaign in Ohio on July 1, 2021.[3] On May 3, 2022, he won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote,[87] defeating multiple candidates, including [[Josh Mandel]] (23%) and [[Matt Dolan]] (22%).[88] On November 8, in the general election, Vance defeated Democratic nominee [[Tim Ryan]] with 53% of the vote to Ryan's 47%.[3][89] This vote share was considered a vast underperformance compared to other Ohio Republicans, especially in the coinciding gubernatorial election.[90] Vance had often previously spelled his name with periods after his initials ("J.D.")—including in the publication of Hillbilly Elegy—but after becoming a candidate for office, he removed the periods ("JD").[1]
On March 1, 2023, Vance and Senator [[Sherrod Brown]] co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to prevent derailments like the one in East Palestine,[92][93] but the bill failed due to lack of intra-caucus Republican support.[94][95][96] In June 2023, Vance voted against raising the debt ceiling, standing against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[97] and saying it would result in "a reduced military in the face of a rising threat from China".[98]
Sacks, Tucker Carlson, and [[Peter Thiel]], who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.[111][112] The Heritage Foundation, which drafted Project 2025, privately advocated for Vance.[113] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory".
Vance wrote in his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, that he was raised in a low-income family by his single mother and grandmother.[7][223] In 2013, Vance met Usha Chilukuri while both were students at Yale Law School.[224] On June 14, 2014, they married in Kentucky in an interfaith marriage ceremony;[225][226] she is Hindu and he is Christian.[225] The wedding included a Bible reading by Vance's "best friend", [[Jamil Jivani]],[66][227] and the bride and groom were blessed by a Hindu pandit.[224][228] Usha clerked for a year for Brett Kavanaugh, at the time an appeals court judge in Washington, then clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts for a year.[229]
Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing Catholic theology's alignment with his political views.[234][235][236] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by [[Peter Thiel]].[237] He was criticized by Pope Francis for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by invoking the traditional concept of ordo amoris present in Catholic theology, which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners[238] and equates with the slogan "America First".[239][240]
