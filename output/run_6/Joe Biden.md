Biden ran for the fourth district seat on the [[New Castle County, Delaware#County Council|New Castle County Council]] in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34][35] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T.
He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, was thought to have no chance of winning.[42][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[43] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[33] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster [[Patrick Caddell]].[42] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with "politics as usual".[42][43] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[42] but his energy, young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[43]
Biden met teacher [[Jill Tracy Jacobs]] in 1975 on a blind date.[52] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[53][54] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[55][56] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[57]
During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[73] In 1974, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns, and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[74] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.
Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of [[Barack Obama]] and Hillary Clinton.[151] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates.
Biden left office on January 20, 2017, and was succeeded by the 48th vice president of the United States, [[Mike Pence]].
When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee.[303] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden.[304] [[Barack Obama]] endorsed Biden the next day.[305] There was a great deal of interest in who his running mate would be, in part because of "the expectation, downplayed but not exactly denied by the Biden campaign, that the 77-year-old would be a one-term president".[306] Biden said, "I view myself as a transition candidate."[306] On August 11, Biden announced [[Kamala Harris]] as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[307] On August 18, at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Biden officially became the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[308][309]
Biden was elected the 46th president in November 2020, defeating the incumbent, [[Donald Trump]].[310] Trump and numerous other Republicans repeatedly made false claims that widespread electoral fraud had occurred and that only he had legitimately won the election.[f] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[313] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W.
Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[g] Trump nonetheless conspired[311]: 33–53  with his campaign team to submit documents in several states (all of which Biden had won) that falsely claimed to be legitimate electoral votes for President Trump and Vice President [[Mike Pence]].[h] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the presiding officer of the United States Senate, either President of the Senate Pence or President pro tempore Chuck Grassley, would claim the unilateral power to reject electors during the January 6, 2021, vote counting session; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states for which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby overturning the election results in Trump's favor.[i] This plan failed after Pence refused to cooperate with it.[j] Trump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6 to march to the Capitol while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, whereupon hundreds of people stormed the building and interrupted the count.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer.[443][444] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[445] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[446] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] breaking the tie.
On March 5 ("Super Tuesday"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13.[705][706] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980.[707] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[708] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[709][710][711]
As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the [[United States Senate]].[779] Biden supports nature conservation.
When Biden left office in 2025, journalists and many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure due to age and health concerns, public frustration over inflation, and Harris's loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election.[868] The Guardian called the conclusion of Biden's presidency a "tragedy", particularly because Biden was succeeded by Trump after previously defeating him.[869] Journalist Ronald Brownstein compared Biden to [[Jimmy Carter]]: Biden's presidency was overshadowed by the 2021–2023 inflation surge, much as the 1970s energy crisis and stagflation overshadowed Carter's presidency.
