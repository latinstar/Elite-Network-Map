The Fox News Channel (FNC), commonly known as Fox News, is an American multinational conservative news and political commentary television channel and website based in New York City.[3][4] It is owned by Fox News Media, which itself is owned by [[Fox Corporation]].[5] It is the most-watched cable news network in the U.S.,[6][7] and as of 2023 it generates approximately 70% of its parent company's pre-tax profit.[8] The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan.
The channel was created by Australian-born American media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] in 1996 to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive [[Roger Ailes]] as its founding CEO.[11][12] It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17-million cable subscribers.[13] Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant United States cable news subscription network.[14] By September 2018, 87-million U.S. households (91% of television subscribers) could receive Fox News.[15] In 2019, it was the top-rated cable network, averaging 2.5-million viewers in prime time.[16][17][18] Murdoch, the executive chairman since 2016,[19][20] said in 2023 that he would step down and hand responsibilities to his son, Lachlan.[21] [[Suzanne Scott]] has been the CEO since 2018.[22]
It has been criticized for biased and false reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes,[23][24][25][26] while portraying the [[Democratic Party]] in a negative light.[27][28] Researchers have argued that the channel is damaging to the integrity of news overall,[29][30] and acts as the de facto broadcasting arm of the Republican Party.[27][31][32][33] Since its formation, the channel has politically shifted further rightwards over time,[34][35][36] and by 2016 became solidly pro-Trump.[37][38][26][39][40][41]
In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop "a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force" to directly compete with CBS, NBC, and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia.[53] In July 1985, 20th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox Filmed Entertainment]], the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.[54]
Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when [[News Corporation]]'s BSkyB subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel ([[Sky News]]) in the United Kingdom in 1989.[55] With the success of his efforts establishing Fox as a TV network in the United States,[56][57] experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 30, 1996, that News Corp.
In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive[59] [[Roger Ailes]] left cable television channel America's Talking (now MSNBC), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel.
The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report, with [[Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news.
During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: The O'Reilly Report (later The O'Reilly Factor), The Crier Report (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and Hannity & Colmes.
When [[Time Warner]] bought [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems.
Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.[61] City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.[62]
In September 2025, Lachlan Murdoch secured control of Fox News, the [[New York Post]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]] in a $3.3 billion dollar deal as part of a renegotiated trust.
Fox News has been identified as practicing biased and false reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes,[23][24][25][26] while portraying the [[Democratic Party]] in a negative light.[27][28] Fox News has been characterized by critics, commentators, and researchers as an advocacy news organization[b] and as damaging to the integrity of news overall.[29][30] It has been criticized for sharing propaganda.[c] The network is pro-Trump.[37][38][101][26][39] During and after the 2020 presidential election, its primetime hosts promoted Trump and the Republican Party,[40] and host [[Jeanine Pirro]] was in communication with the chair of the [[Republican National Committee]].[41]
Its news coverage has gradually shifted further rightwards over time.[34][35][36] Fox's most popular programs such as Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight do not make any claims to be accurate or fact-checked, and have little to no distinction between news and commentary.[102] Media analyst [[Brian Stelter]], who has written extensively about the network, observed in 2021 that in more recent years it had adjusted its programming to present "less news on the air and more opinions-about-the-news" throughout the day, on concerns it was losing viewers to more conservative competitors that were presenting such content.[104]
In an October 11, 2009, in a [[New York Times]] article, Fox said its hard-news programming runs from "9 AM to 4 PM and 6 to 8 PM on weekdays".
With the growth of the FNC, the company introduced a radio division, [[Fox News Radio]], in 2003.[108] Syndicated throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions.
In 2006, the company also introduced [[Fox News Talk]], a satellite radio station featuring programs syndicated by (and featuring) Fox News personalities.
Fox News' articles are based on the network's broadcasts, reports from Fox affiliates and articles produced by other news agencies, such as the [[Associated Press]].
In 2018, Fox News announced that it would launch a subscription video on demand service known as [[Fox Nation]].
Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity's actions, with one stating that "a new line was crossed".[228] Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned, and Fox News stated it "does not condone any talent participating in campaign events".[229] Fox News host [[Jeanine Pirro]] also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally.
However, certain Fox personalities have not had as much of a favorable reception from Trump: news anchors Shepard Smith (who retired from Fox in 2019) and Chris Wallace have been criticized by Trump for allegedly being adversarial,[240][241] alongside Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano, who said Trump's actions in the Trump–Ukraine scandal were "both criminal and impeachable behavior".[242] Trump was also critical of the network hiring former DNC chair Donna Brazile, in 2019.[243] The relationship between Trump and Fox News, as well as other [[Rupert Murdoch]]-controlled outlets, soured following the 2020 United States presidential election, as Trump refused to concede that Joe Biden had been elected President-elect.[244][245] This negative tonal shift led to increased viewership of Newsmax and One America News among Trump and his supporters due to their increased antipathy towards Fox;[246][247][248][249] and as a result, Fox released promotional videos of their opinion hosts disputing the election results, promoting a Trump-affiliated conspiracy theory about voter fraud.[250] By one measure, Newsmax saw a 497% spike in viewership, while Fox News saw a 38% decline.[251]
After Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Fox News host [[Jeanine Pirro]] promoted baseless allegations on her program that voting machine company Smartmatic and its competitor Dominion Voting Systems had conspired to rig the election against Trump.
Fox News's extensive coverage of the Harvey Weinstein scandal in October 2017 was seen by some as hypocritical.[402][403] Fox News dedicated at least 12 hours of coverage to the Weinstein scandal, yet only dedicated 20 minutes to Bill O'Reilly, who just like Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women.[402][403] A few weeks later, when a number of females under the age of 18, including a 14-year-old, accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making sexual advances, Hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his television show to casting doubt on the accusers.[404][405] Other prime-time Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham queried The Washington Post's reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K.[194] Fox News figures [[Jeanine Pirro]] and Gregg Jarrett questioned both the validity of The Washington Post's reporting and that of the women.[406] In December 2017, a few days before the Alabama Senate election, Fox News, along with the conspiracy websites Breitbart News and The Gateway Pundit, ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of Roy Moore's accusers admitted to forging an inscription by Roy Moore in her yearbook; Fox News later added a correction to the story.[407]
The potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal, who felt [[Sky News]] could similarly undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint.
