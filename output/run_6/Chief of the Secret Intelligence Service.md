The chief of the Secret Intelligence Service serves as the head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS, also commonly known as MI6), which is part of the [[United Kingdom intelligence community]].
The chief of the Secret Intelligence Service typically signs letters with a "C" in green ink.[3] This originates from the initial used by [[Captain]] Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming, when he signed a letter "C" in green ink.
From 1782 until 1909, British intelligence at the government level was handled directly by the [[Foreign Office]], with the Army and Navy also maintaining their own intelligence branches.
By 1909, growing tensions with Germany led the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] to recommend the creation of the [[Secret Service Bureau]] to provide organization and leadership to the intelligence-gathering process as well as a layer of insulation from espionage activities for the Foreign Office.[4] A 10 August 1909 letter from the Director of Naval Intelligence, [[Alexander Bethell]], to then-Commander Mansfield Smith-Cumming offered him a "new billet": the opportunity to head the Foreign Section of the new [[Secret Service Bureau]].
Although Cumming and his successor [[Hugh Sinclair]] both had long Navy careers,[7] in 1939 Army veteran [[Stewart Menzies]] was appointed over naval officer (and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s preferred candidate) [[Gerard Muirhead-Gould]].[8] Plans to rotate the selection of Chief among the various branches of military service were considered, but most subsequent Chiefs have been career intelligence officers.[7]
In 1932, [[Compton MacKenzie]] was fined under the Official Secrets Act for elements of his book Greek Memories.
Since then, the office has had more public visibility, including a speech by [[John Sawers]] in 2010, described by The Times as "the first of its kind".[11][12] The Chief remains the only member of the Secret Intelligence Service whose identity is officially made public.[2]
In June 2025, it was announced that Sir Richard Moore would be succeeded by [[Blaise Metreweli]], who would be the first woman to hold the role of C.[14]
