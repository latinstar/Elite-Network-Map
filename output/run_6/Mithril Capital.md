Mithril Capital Management is an American venture capital firm founded by [[Peter Thiel]] and Ajay Royan in San Francisco in 2012.[1] It was named after the fictional metal mithril.[2]
Mithril was conceptualized as complementing the [[Founders Fund]]'s investments in early stage startups, but according to Bloomberg, from the start, the two firms have competed.
After the Founders Fund got the deal, Thiel arranged for Mithril to invest in [[Palantir Technologies|Palantir]] as compensation.[4]
And it has left a long list of scorned parties, slowly shrinking the firm's headcount of investors — despite having more than $1.3 billion in assets under management."[6] Vox notes that at this time Thiel was heavily burdened by politics and did not have much time for his own firms.[6] The firm's former lawyer [[Crystal McKellar]] and Ajay Royan launched mutual lawsuits against each other.[4] According to McKellar, at one point, Thiel considered shutting the firm down, but relented when Royan appeared to recognize the problems.[9][4] She also alleged that she tried to change the firm without results, and thus requested investigations by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the SEC, prompting the FBI to initiate an inquiry.[4][10][11] In 2020, both McKellar's and Mithril's legal cases were withdrawn.[12] Some investors also complained about the fact Royan had deployed only a quarter of the fund at the time, while some employees complained about Royan's sister and father being put on the company's payroll.
Leading figures of the company have included [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Crystal McKellar]], [[Jim O'Neill]] and Matt Grimm.[40]
Before Mithril, he was the CTO of the [[World Economic Forum]].
Later he led the Hyperledger  project at the [[Linux Foundation]].[41] He currently serves as a board member at [[Mozilla Foundation]] and [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].[42][43] He is a leading figure of the opensource movement.[40]
Matt Grimm, who was a principal between 2014 and 2016, went to become [[Anduril Industries|Anduril]]'s co-founder and COO in 2017.
U.S. vice president [[JD Vance]] worked for the firm for a year.[45] Vance went on to form Narya Capital alongside Mithril colleague Colin Greenspon in 2019.[46] Before Mithril, Vance worked at a biotech company named Circuit Therapeutics, Inc.
But Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[47] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Royan and decided to leave in 2017.[48] Greenspon also left Mithril and joined Vance at Revolution LLC in 2018.[49][40] Bloomberg notes that afterwards, Vance deleted all traces related to Mithril on his LinkedIn profile.[4] Thiel backed Narya, together with [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Schmidt]].[50]
[[Jim O'Neill]] left in 2019, also after clash with Royan.
