Kamala Devi Harris (/ˈkɑːmələ ˈdeɪvi/ ⓘ KAH-mə-lə DAY-vee;[1] born October 20, 1964) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 49th vice president of the United States from 2021 to 2025 under President [[Joe Biden]].
A member of the [[Democratic Party]], she was the party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election.
She gained a national profile while asking pointed questions of officials from the first Trump administration during Senate hearings, including President [[Donald Trump]]'s second U.S. Supreme Court nominee, [[Brett Kavanaugh]].
Biden selected her as his running mate; their ticket defeated the incumbent president and vice president, Trump and [[Mike Pence]], in the 2020 presidential election.
She later became the nominee and selected Minnesota governor [[Tim Walz]] as her running mate.
Kamala Harris attended Vanier College in Montreal in 1981–1982;[20] she then attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C.[21][22] At Howard, she became a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], one of the "Divine Nine" historically black sororities.[23] She graduated in 1986 with a degree in political science and economics.[24][25] Harris then attended the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco,[26] where she served as president of its chapter of the [[Black Law Students Association]].[27] She graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1989.[28]
In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, where she was described as "an able prosecutor on the way up".[29] In 1994, Speaker of the California Assembly [[Willie Brown]], who was then dating Harris, appointed her to the state [[California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board|Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board]] and later to the California Medical Assistance Commission.[29] In February 1998, [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|San Francisco district attorney]] [[Terence Hallinan]] recruited Harris as an assistant district attorney.[30] There, she became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys, where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery, and sexual assault cases—particularly three-strikes cases.
In August 2000, Harris took a job at San Francisco City Hall, working for city attorney [[Louise Renne]].[31] Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division, representing child abuse and neglect cases.
SFPD officers credited Harris with tightening the loopholes defendants had used in the past.[40] During her campaign, Harris pledged never to seek the death penalty,[41] and kept to this in the cases of a [[San Francisco Police Department]] officer, Isaac Espinoza, who was shot and killed in 2004,[42][43] and of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering a man and his two sons in 2009.[44][45]
In 2010, Harris announced her candidacy for attorney general and was endorsed by prominent California Democrats, including U.S. senators [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Barbara Boxer]] and House speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]].[60] She won the Democratic primary and narrowly defeated Republican nominee [[Steve Cooley]] in the general election.[61] Her tenure was marked by significant efforts in consumer protection, criminal justice reform, and privacy rights.
In 2014, Harris was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Ronald Gold with 58% of the vote.[59] Her future opponent in the 2024 United States presidential election, [[Donald Trump]], made two contributions to her reelection campaign totaling $6,000.
During her second term, Harris expanded her focus on consumer protection, recovering billions for California consumers by securing major settlements against corporations like [[Quest Diagnostics]],[63] JPMorgan Chase,[64] and [[Corinthian Colleges]].[65][66] She spearheaded the creation of the Homeowner Bill of Rights to combat aggressive foreclosure practices during the housing crisis, recording multiple nine-figure settlements against mortgage servicers.[67][68] Harris also worked on privacy rights.
After more than 20 years as a U.S. senator from California, Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] announced on January 13, 2015 that she would not run for reelection in 2016.[83] Harris announced her candidacy for the Senate seat the next week.[83] She was a top contender from the beginning of her campaign.[84]
The 2016 California Senate election used California's new top-two primary format, where the top two candidates in the primary advance to the general election regardless of party.[84] On February 27, 2016, Harris won 78% of the [[California Democratic Party]] vote at the party convention, allowing her campaign to receive financial support from the party.[85] Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.[86] In the June 7 primary, Harris came in first with 40% of the vote and won with pluralities in most counties.[87] Harris faced representative and fellow Democrat [[Loretta Sanchez]] in the general election.[88]
On July 19, President [[Barack Obama]] and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] endorsed Harris.[89] In the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez with over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.[90] After her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of president-elect [[Donald Trump]] and announced her intention to remain attorney general through the end of 2016.[91][92] Harris became the second Black woman and first South Asian American senator in history.[93][94][95]
As a senator, Harris advocated stricter gun control laws,[96][97] the DREAM Act, federal legalization of cannabis, and healthcare and taxation reforms.[98][99] She became well known nationally after questioning several Trump appointees such as [[Jeff Sessions]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]].[100]
In February, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks [[Betsy DeVos]] for secretary of education[103] and [[Jeff Sessions]] for United States attorney general.[104] In early March, she called on Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions, who had previously said he "did not have communications with the Russians", spoke twice with Russian ambassador to the United States [[Sergey Kislyak]].[105]
In April, Harris voted against the confirmation of [[Neil Gorsuch]] to the U.S. Supreme Court.[106] Later that month, she took her first foreign trip to the Middle East, visiting California troops stationed in Iraq and the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the largest camp for Syrian refugees.[107]
In June, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of [[Rod Rosenstein]], the deputy attorney general, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[108] The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness.
A week later, she questioned [[Jeff Sessions]], the attorney general, on the same topic.[109] Sessions said her questioning "makes me nervous".[110] Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestions in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.[111]
In the September and October Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris questioned [[Brett Kavanaugh]] about a meeting he may have had regarding the Mueller Investigation with a member of Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by [[Donald Trump]]'s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz.
On May 1, 2019, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[134] During the hearing, he remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he had released ahead of the full report.[135] When asked by Harris whether he had reviewed the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice, Barr admitted that neither he, [[Rod Rosenstein]], nor anyone in his office had reviewed the evidence supporting the report before making the charging decision.[136] Harris later called for Barr to resign, accusing him of refusing to answer her questions because he could open himself up to perjury, and saying his responses disqualified him from serving as U.S. attorney general.[137][138] Two days later, Harris demanded again that Department of Justice inspector general Michael E.
On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from the 2020 presidential election, citing a shortage of funds.[176] In March 2020, she endorsed [[Joe Biden]] for president.[177]
In February and March, Harris's tie-breaking votes were required to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package Biden proposed, since no Senate Republicans voted for it.[197][198] On July 20, Harris broke [[Mike Pence]]'s record for tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency[199] when she cast the seventh tie-breaking vote in her first six months.[200] She cast 13 tie-breaking votes during her first year in office, the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing John Adams, who cast 12 in 1790.[200][201] On December 5, 2023, Harris broke the record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president, casting her 32nd vote, exceeding John C.
By August 5, Harris had officially secured the nomination via a virtual roll call of delegates.[238][239][240] The next day, she announced Minnesota governor [[Tim Walz]] as her vice-presidential running mate.[241] On August 22, the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, Harris officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president.[242]
In the 1990s, Harris dated [[Willie Brown]], Speaker of the California Assembly (1980–1995) and then mayor of San Francisco (1996–2004).[29] Although still technically married, Brown had been separated from his wife for over a decade during his relationship with Harris.[309] In 2001, Harris briefly dated talk show host Montel Williams.[310]
