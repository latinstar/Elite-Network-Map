The United States Senate is a chamber of the bicameral [[United States Congress]]; it is the upper house, and the U.S. House of Representatives is the lower house.
Officials whose appointments require the Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal executive agencies, ambassadors, justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and other federal judges.
Neither executive agreements nor congressional-executive agreements are mentioned in the Constitution, leading some scholars such as [[Laurence Tribe]] and [[John Yoo]][31] to suggest that they unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty-ratification process.
The House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted (one resigned before the Senate could complete the trial).[33] Only three presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2019 and 2021.
On November 7, 1972, [[Joe Biden]] was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, which was only 13 days prior to his 30th birthday on November 20, 1972.
In September 2009, Massachusetts changed its law to enable the governor to appoint a temporary replacement for the late senator [[Edward Kennedy]] until the special election in January 2010.[43][44]
Senators are covered by the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS) or [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS).
For example, minority leader [[Chuck Schumer]] is the senior senator from New York, having served in the senate since 1999, while [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] is New York's junior senator, having served since 2009.
Like members of the House of Representatives, senators use the prefix "The Honorable" before their names.[54][55] Senators are usually identified in the media and other sources by party and state; for example, Democratic majority leader [[Chuck Schumer]], who represents New York, may be identified as "D–New York" or (D-NY).
Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as [[Robert Torricelli]] in 2002.
The [[Democratic Party]] traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the [[Republican Party]] traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats.[56]
The [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] handle routine police work, with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight.
Journalist [[George Packer]] has argued that the Senate's arcane rules have rendered it obsolete and ineffective.[62]
The longest filibuster speech in the Senate's history was delivered by [[Strom Thurmond]] (D-SC), who spoke for over 24 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
The longest individual speech (though not technically a filibuster as there was no bill being blocked) in the Senate's history was delivered by [[Cory Booker]] (D-NJ) in 2025.
