In 2004, Schumer was reelected with 71% of the vote, defeating the Republican nominee, Assemblyman [[Howard Mills]] of Middletown, and conservative Marilyn F.
Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative [[Michael Benjamin Bonheur|Michael Benjamin]], who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.[27] Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman [[Alexander Treadwell|Sandy Treadwell]] and governor [[George Pataki]] of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process.[27] Schumer defeated Mills by 2.8 million votes.[28] He won every county in the state except Hamilton County, in the Adirondacks, the least populous and most Republican county.[28] Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.[28]

As chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy.[308] Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.[309][310]
One of his aides at the time, [[Daniel Squadron]], helped write it, and they drew from Schumer's experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.[30][314]
