Based upon the Committee's review of State Department and [[CIA]] documents, it would seem that Ambassador Negroponte knew far more about human rights abuses perpetrated by the Honduran government than he chose to share with the committee in 1989 or in embassy contributions at the time to annual State Department Human Rights reports.
Bush named Negroponte as the first [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]], (DNI), a cabinet-level position charged with coordinating the nation's [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]].[24] On April 21, 2005, Negroponte was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 2 in the Senate, and subsequently sworn into the office that was called "substantially stronger" than its predecessor position, the Director of Central Intelligence.[25] Part of its power stemmed from the ability to "determine" budgets, prompting President Bush to remark, "That's why John Negroponte is going to have a lot of influence.
