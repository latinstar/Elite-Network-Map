Onward Together is an American political action organization founded in May 2017 by former U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] to fundraise for progressive political groups including: [[Swing Left]], [[Indivisible movement|Indivisible]], [[Color of Change]], [[Emerge America]], and [[Run for Something]].[1][2][3][4][5] Clinton described the group as an effort "to advance the vision that won nearly 66 million votes" of a "fairer, more inclusive, big-hearted America."[6]
Clinton co-founded the group with [[Howard Dean]].[7] In August 2017, Dean confirmed that Onward Together had hired Emmy Ruiz and [[Adam Parkhomenko]] as consultants, both of whom were members of Clinton's [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008]] and 2016 presidential campaigns.[7][8]
On May 15, 2017, [[Hillary Clinton]] tweeted the launch of Onward Together from her personal Twitter account.[9] Clinton transferred $800,000 from her 2016 presidential campaign to Onward Together shortly before announcing the group's launch in May, as documents that the campaign filed with the FEC revealed.[10]
During the 2018 United States midterm elections the PAC funded Democratic candidates as well as grassroots organizations such as [[Swing Left]].[11]
