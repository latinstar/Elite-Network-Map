The Five Eyes (FVEY) is an Anglosphere intelligence alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].[1] These countries are party to the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.[2][3][4] Informally, "Five Eyes" can refer to the group of intelligence agencies of these countries.
The term "Five Eyes" originated as shorthand for a "AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US Eyes Only" (AUSCANNZUKUS) [[Classified information in the United States#Handling caveats|releasability caveat]].[5]
In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the [[United States Congress]] and British Parliament.
Former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] described the Five Eyes as a "supra-national intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries".[10] Disclosures in the 2010s revealed FVEY was spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other, although the FVEY nations maintain this was done legally.[11][12]
The informal origins of the Five Eyes alliance were secret meetings between British and US code-breakers at the British code-breaking establishment Bletchley Park in February 1941, before the US entry into the war.[14] The first record of these meetings is a February 1941 diary entry from [[Alastair Denniston]], head of Bletchley Park, reading "The Ys are coming!" with "Ys" referring to "Yanks".
For the rest of the war, key figures like Denniston and code-breaking expert [[Alan Turing]] travelled back and forth across the Atlantic.
On 5 March 1946, the two governments formalized their secret treaty as the UKUSA Agreement, the basis for all signal intelligence cooperation between the [[NSA]] and [[GCHQ]] up to the present.[16][17]
During the Cold War, [[GCHQ]] and the [[NSA]] shared intelligence on the Soviet Union, China, and several eastern European countries known as "Exotics".[18] Over the course of several decades, the ECHELON surveillance network was developed to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies.[19]
In 1953, [[MI6|SIS]] and the [[CIA]] jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.[20][21][22][23]
From 1955 through 1975 during the Vietnam War, Australian and New Zealander operators in the Asia-Pacific region worked to directly support the United States while [[GCHQ]] operators stationed in British Hong Kong as part of [[RAF Little Sai Wan|GCHQ Hong Kong]] were tasked with monitoring North Vietnamese air defence networks.[24][25]
In 1961, [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[CIA]] jointly orchestrated the assassination of the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba, an operation authorized by out-going US President Dwight D.
In 1973, the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] and the [[CIA]] jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende.[29][30][31][32]
Over a period of at least five years in the 1970s, a senior officer named Ian George Peacock, who was in the counterespionage unit of Australia's [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]], stole highly classified intelligence documents that had been shared with Australia and sold them to the Soviet Union.
In 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests, [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[CIA]] took part in Operation Yellowbird to exfiltrate dissidents from China.[37]
In the aftermath of the Gulf War in 1991, an [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] technician bugged Kuwaiti government offices for [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]].[35]
The PRISM program gathers user information from technology firms such as [[Google]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Microsoft]]; while the Upstream system gathers information directly from civilian communications as they travel through infrastructure like fiber cables.[39] The program was first disclosed to the public in 1972 when a former [[NSA]] communications analyst reported to Ramparts magazine that the Agency had developed technology that "could crack all Soviet codes".[40]
In 1996, New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager provided a detailed description of ECHELON in a book titled [[Nicky Hager#Secret Power|Secret Power – New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network]].
In the United States, [[United States Congress|congressional]] legislators warned that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor US citizens.[46] On 14 May 2001, the US government cancelled all meetings with the Temporary Committee on ECHELON.[47] According to a BBC report from May 2001, "The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists."[19]
During the run-up to the Iraq War, the communications of UN weapons inspector Hans Blix were monitored by the Five Eyes.[48][49] Around the same time, [[United Kingdom|British]] agents bugged the office of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.[50][51] An [[NSA]] memo detailed Five Eyes plans to increase surveillance on the UN delegations of six countries as part of a "dirty tricks" campaign to pressure these six countries to vote in favour of using force against Iraq.[50][52][53]
[[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[CIA]] formed a surveillance partnership with Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi to spy on Libyan dissidents in the West in exchange for permission to use Libya as a base for extraordinary renditions.[54][55][56][57][58]
In 2013, documents leaked by the former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed the existence of numerous surveillance programs jointly operated by the Five Eyes.
In March 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Australia to seal documents and data seized by [[ASIO]] in a raid on the office of East Timor's lawyer, Bernard Collaery.
The material related to the Timor Sea Treaty negotiations between East Timor and Australia and included legal documents, electronic files and a statement by a former ASIS agent alleging that [[Australia–Timor-Leste spying scandal|Australia eavesdropped]] on East Timor during negotiations.
On 1 December 2018, Canadian authorities arrested [[Meng Wanzhou]], a [[Huawei]] executive, at Vancouver International Airport to face charges of fraud and conspiracy in the United States.[68]  China responded by arresting two Canadian nationals.
Starting in 2019, Australian parliamentarians as well as [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] Mike Pompeo prompted the United Kingdom not to use [[Huawei]] technology in its 5G network.[72] In 2021, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] announced it no longer planned to use Huawei's 5G technology.[73]
In mid-April 2021, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|New Zealand Foreign Minister]] Nanaia Mahuta issued a statement that New Zealand would not let the Five Eyes alliance dictate its [[China-New Zealand relations|bilateral relationship]] with China and that New Zealand was uncomfortable with expanding the remit of the intelligence grouping.
In response, the Australian Government expressed concern that Wellington was undermining collective efforts to combat what it regarded as Chinese aggression.[75][76] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand Prime Minister]] Jacinda Ardern echoed Mahuta's remarks and claimed that while New Zealand was still committed to the Five Eyes alliance, it would not use the network as its first point of communication for non-security matters.
While The Telegraph's defence editor Con Coughlin and British Conservative Member of Parliament Bob Seely criticised New Zealand for undermining the Five Eyes' efforts to present a united front against Beijing, the Chinese Global Times praised New Zealand for putting its own national interests over the Five Eyes.[77][78][79] Following the [[2023 New Zealand general election]], the new New Zealand Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters promised closer cooperation with Five Eyes partners.[80] According to The Economist and Foreign Policy magazine, New Zealand foreign policy under the new [[Sixth National Government of New Zealand|National-led coalition government]] had shifted away from China in favour of closer relations with its traditional Five Eyes partners.[81] During an interview with The Economist, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said that he was looking to "diversify New Zealand's diplomatic and trade relationships away from its [[China-New Zealand relations|reliance]] on China".[82]
In mid-December 2021, the [[United States Secretary of State]], the Foreign Ministers of [[Minister for Foreign Affairs|Australia]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|Canada]], and [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|New Zealand]], and the [[Foreign Secretary|UK Foreign Secretary]] issued a joint statement criticising the exclusion of opposition candidates by [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Hong Kong national security law]] and urging China to respect human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.[85][86]  In response, the Chinese Government claimed the Hong Kong elections were fair and criticised the Five Eyes for interfering in Hong Kong's domestic affairs.[87][88]
NSA whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] leaked documents from the NSA that showed Singapore, one of the world's biggest digital telecommunications hubs, is a key “third party” working with the “Five Eyes” intelligence partners,[108] and continue to collaborate intensively with the alliance, though Singapore, Israel, South Korea and Japan are formally non-members.[109][110]
New York magazine reported in 2013 that Germany was interested in joining the Five Eyes alliance.[112][113] At the time, several members of the United States Congress, including [[Tim Ryan]] and Charles Dent, were pushing for Germany's entry to the Five Eyes alliance.[114]
