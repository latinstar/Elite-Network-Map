Peter Andreas Thiel (/tiːl/ ⓘ; born 11 October 1967) is a German and American[1][2][3][4] entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist.[5][6][7] A co-founder of PayPal, [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Founders Fund]], he was the first outside investor in Facebook.[8][9] According to Forbes, as of May 2025, Thiel's estimated net worth stood at US$20.8 billion, making him the 103rd-richest individual in the world.[10] Thiel has been described as "perhaps America's leading public intellectual today",[11] or "intellectual architect of Silicon Valley's contemporary ethos".[12] Others debate the consistency or morality of his views.[13][N 1][15][16]
In 1971, his family moved to South Africa then South West Africa,[17] before moving back to the US in 1977.[17] After graduating from Stanford, he worked as a clerk, a securities lawyer, a speechwriter, and subsequently a derivatives trader at [[Credit Suisse]].
He founded Thiel Capital Management in 1996 and co-founded PayPal with [[Max Levchin]] and [[Luke Nosek]] in 1998.
Following PayPal, Thiel founded [[Clarium Capital]], a global macro hedge fund based in San Francisco.[18] In 2003, he launched Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company, and has been its chairman since its inception.
In 2005, Thiel launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners [[Ken Howery]] and Luke Nosek.
He co-founded [[Valar Ventures]] in 2010, founded [[Thiel Capital]] in 2011, co-founded [[Mithril Capital]] in 2012, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017.[19][20][21][22] He was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011, which later became controversial in New Zealand.
Through the [[Thiel Foundation]], Thiel governs the grant-making bodies [[Breakout Labs]] and [[Thiel Fellowship]].
The replacement of a "Western Culture" program at Stanford with a "Culture, Ideas and Values" course that addressed diversity and multiculturalism prompted Thiel to co-found [[The Stanford Review]], a conservative and libertarian newspaper, in 1987.
Thiel has maintained his relationship with the paper, consulting with staff and donating to the newspaper.[35] According to [[Marc Andreessen]], Thiel's time at the Review marked the beginning of a career-long strategy: using provocative verbal cues – later delivered through talks, books and mottos – as a way to attract capable individuals to his projects, preferring this method over actively seeking out talent.
The Review has spawned a large network of industry leaders, among whom Andrew Granato and the Fortune respectively identify around 300 people who have worked for or received investment from Peter Thiel or [[Joe Lonsdale]], another prominent editor-in-chief and Thiel's mentee.
A number of Review alumni have also become public officials, beginning with [[Jay Bhattacharya]] and Paula M.
After graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel was a law clerk to Judge [[James Larry Edmondson]] of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from 1992 to 1993.[42] Thiel then worked as a securities lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.
He left the law firm in under a year.[43] He then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at [[Credit Suisse]] in 1993 while also working as a speechwriter for former United States secretary of education [[William Bennett]].
Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend [[Luke Nosek]]'s unsuccessful web-based calendar project.
Soon thereafter, Nosek's friend [[Max Levchin]] described to Thiel his cryptography-related company idea, which became their first venture called Fieldlink (later renamed Confinity) in 1998.[45][46]
When PayPal launched at a press conference in 1999, representatives from Nokia and [[Deutsche Bank]] sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their PalmPilots.
PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in 2000 with [[Elon Musk]]'s online financial services company X.com, and with Pixo, a company specializing in mobile commerce.
Thiel used $10 million of his proceeds to create [[Clarium Capital Management]], a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities.[53] Thiel stated that "the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium—the idée fixe—was the peak-oil theory, which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives."[31]
In 2003, Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken.[54] In 2004, Thiel spoke of the dot-com bubble having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified [[General Electric]] and Walmart as vulnerable.
On 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting and would leave after 17 years in order to support pro–[[Donald Trump]] candidates in the 2022 United States elections.[62][83]
In 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund.[84][18] Other partners in the fund include [[Sean Parker]], [[Ken Howery]], and [[Luke Nosek]].[85]
In addition to Facebook, the Founders Fund made early-stage investments in numerous startups, including Airbnb,[31] Slide.com,[91] LinkedIn,[31] Friendster,[92] RapLeaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Spotify,[31] Practice Fusion, MetaMed, Vator, SpaceX,[31] IronPort, Votizen, Asana, [[Big Think]], CapLinked, Nanotronics Imaging, Powerset (Thiel is on the board of Nanotronics and Powerset[93]), Stripe, Bullish Global (the parent company Block.one had also received investment from Thiel [94]), AltSchool,[95] Trade Republic,[96] PsiQuantum (photonic quantum computing),[97] and Rigetti Computing (superconducting quantum computing).[98] Thiel also backed DeepMind, a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for £400 million.[99] Founders Fund is an important backer of the Berlin-based platform ResearchGate.[100]
In 2019, Thiel, together with Mark Cuban and [[Marc Andreessen]], backed the San Francisco-based crypto investment fund 1Confirmation.[280]
Thiel initially supported Carly Fiorina's campaign during the 2016 GOP presidential primary elections.[431] After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported [[Donald Trump]] and became one of the California delegates for Trump's nomination.
In November 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of [[Breakout Labs]], a grant-making program intended "to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government."[481][482] It offers grants of up to $350,000 to science-focused start-ups, "with no strings attached".[483][484] In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees.[482][485] In total, 12 startups received funding, for a total of $4.5 million in grants.[483] One of the first ventures to receive funding from Breakout Labs was 3Scan, a tissue imaging platform.[484]
Breakout Ventures is a privately held venture capital firm founded in 2016 out of [[Breakout Labs]] to invest in science.[486][487] Based in San Francisco, California, it invests in early-stage companies in technology, biology, and chemistry focused on human health and sustainability.[488] The program focuses on biotech with a mix of hardware.
He notes that wokeism has a concept of the original sin as well as demands confession and repentance, while offering no transcendental values, no forgiveness or chance of redemption through sacrifice.[523][524][525][526] He claims that this strand of thinking, which attacks Christians for not doing enough for victims or the poor, is a continuation of communism and the social gospel, which also inherit some Christian characteristics while being anti-Christian at the same time.[520] Mikhail Minakov writes that "Thiel's conception of will integrates Christian eschatology, Girardian mimetic theory, and Straussian elitism to critique the impotence of liberal democracy while proposing the efficiency of a techno-feudal alternative."[524] Elke Schwarz, a professor of political theory, notes that Peter Thiel and [[Marc Andreessen]] are the foremost proponents of techno-eschatology, which demonstrates the sacralizing of AI and uses spiritualism to bolster the logic of venture capitalism.[527] Thiel opines that, "Crypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing.
In The Social Network, Thiel was portrayed by Wallace Langham.[550] He described the film as "wrong on many levels".[551] His distaste for the portrayal led to the establishment of the [[Thiel Fellowship]] on a whim.[552]
