The DO "serves as the clandestine arm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the national authority for the coordination, de-confliction, and evaluation of clandestine operations across the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community of the United States]]".[3]
There was operational overlap between the two CIA departments, even though OSO was focused on intelligence collection whereas OPC was more focused on covert action.[4] Director of Central Intelligence [[Walter Bedell Smith]] attempted to ameliorate the situation by appointing [[Allen Dulles]] on January 4, 1951, to the new position of Deputy Director for Plans (DDP) where he would supervise the two entities.
According to Anne Karalekas, a staffer of the [[Church Committee]] who wrote a history of the CIA, that was merely a cosmetic change, and it was only on August 1, 1952, that OPC and OSO were properly merged to form the Directorate of Plans (DDP).[4] The Directorate of Plans used the abbreviation of its chief.[5] According to John Prados, the name was intended to disguise the true function of the Directorate.[5]
Initially, the supervision by committee allowed the OPC to exercise early use of its new covert action mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of [[United States Department of State|State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]].
Concerned about this situation, DCI [[Walter Bedell Smith]] in early 1951 asked the NSC for enhanced policy guidance and a ruling on the proper "scope and magnitude" of CIA operations.
Putting special operations under a "psychological" organization paralleled the military's development of [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Army Special Forces]], which was created by a Pentagon unit called the Psychological Warfare Division.
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, a report by the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001]], conducted by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], and the report released by the [[11 Commission|National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]], identified serious shortcomings in the Intelligence Community's HUMINT capabilities, ranging from the lack of qualified linguists to the lack of Community-wide information sharing.
These efforts resulted in the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in 2004, which created the position of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] and tasked the CIA's Director with developing a "strategy for improving the human intelligence and other capabilities of the Agency."[10]
In 2004, Senator [[Pat Roberts]], the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]]'s Chairman, drafted the 9/11 National Security Protection Act[11] in which he proposed that the Directorate of Operations be removed from the CIA and established as an independent agency known as the National Clandestine Service (NCS).
The NCS' creation was also recommended by the [[Iraq Intelligence Commission|Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]].[12] The Commission's investigation found that HUMINT capabilities had been severely degraded since the end of the Cold War and were ill-suited for targeting non-state actors such as terrorist organizations.

A major headquarters element was the [[Counterintelligence Staff]], most powerful when led by [[James Jesus Angleton]].
Under an assortment of names, such as Special Activities Center (SAC), there is a paramilitary function that may enter and prepare an area of operations before [[U.S. Special Operation Forces]] enter in a more overt military role.
SAC maintains a symbiotic relationship with the [[Joint Special Operations Command]], and is largely run by former JSOC members.[17]
Sometimes in cooperation with technical personnel at other agencies such as the NSA when the collection discipline is SIGINT, or the DIA when the techniques come MASINT, or other appropriate agencies such as the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] for nuclear information, the CIA may work to place technical collection equipment in denied territory.
For example, there may be a name check on a business or scientific contact who meets either with CIA representatives or staff of the [[National Open Source Enterprise]].
The Directorate has been subject to harsh criticism in the media, and due to its covert and independent nature did not, or could not, effectively respond.[citation needed] Its capabilities had been in decline since the public outcry resulting from the [[Church Committee]]'s revelations of the DO's highly questionable activities.
Furthermore, the DO fought frequent power shifting "turf" battles[clarification needed] amongst the executive branch bureaucracies, most prominently with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] and [[United States Department of State|State]] departments.
