Willard Mitt Romney (born March 12, 1947) is an American businessman and retired politician who served as a [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from Utah from 2019 to 2025 and as the 70th governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.
He was the [[Republican Party]]'s nominee in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.
He married [[Ann Romney|Ann Davies]] in 1969; they have five sons.
In 1971, Romney graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and in 1975 he completed a JD–MBA program from Harvard.
In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off company [[Bain Capital]], a private equity investment firm that became one of the largest of its kind in the nation.
After stepping down from his positions at Bain Capital and in the LDS Church, Romney ran as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts in 1994 and lost to the incumbent, [[Ted Kennedy]].
Romney did not seek reelection in 2006, instead focusing on his campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2008 presidential election, which he lost to Senator [[John McCain]].
He lost the election to President [[Barack Obama]].
Generally considered a moderate or neoconservative Republican,[2][3] Romney was the lone Republican to vote to convict [[Donald Trump]] in his first impeachment trial, making him the first senator ever to have voted to remove a president of the same party from office.[4] Romney also voted to convict in Trump's second trial in 2021.
He marched alongside [[Black Lives Matter]] protestors, voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], supported gun control measures, and did not vote for Trump in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections.
He has since apologized for them, stating that some of them may have gone too far.[nb 1] In March of his senior year, he began dating [[Ann Romney|Ann Davies]]; she attended the private Kingswood School, Cranbrook's sister school.[23][30] The two became informally engaged around the time he graduated from high school in June 1965.[21][26]
Romney attended [[Stanford University]] during the 1965–1966 academic year.[21] He was not part of the counterculture of the 1960s then taking form in the San Francisco Bay Area.[21] As opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew, a group staged a May 1966 sit-in at Stanford's administration building to demonstrate against draft status tests; Romney joined a counterprotest against that group.[21][31] He continued to enjoy occasional pranks.[nb 2]
At their first meeting following his return, Romney and Ann Davies reconnected and decided to get married.[48] Before their wedding, Romney moved to Utah and enrolled at [[Brigham Young University]], where Ann had been studying.[49] They married on March 21, 1969, in a civil ceremony in Bloomfield Hills and the next day, they flew to Utah for a Mormon wedding ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple; Ann had converted to the faith while he was away.[50][51]
Romney wanted to pursue a business career, but his father advised him that a Juris Doctor degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law.[59][60] As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between [[Harvard Law School]] and [[Harvard Business School]].[61] He readily adapted to the business school's pragmatic, data-driven case study method of teaching.[60] Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts, house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from that of most of his classmates.[50][60] He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day.[50][60] Romney graduated from Harvard in 1975.
After receiving his JD–MBA from Harvard, Romney passed the Michigan bar exam but decided to pursue a career in business rather than law.[72] He was recruited by several large companies but joined the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG), reasoning that working as a management consultant for a variety of companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive.[59][73] Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly,[74] he found his legal and business education useful in his job.[59] He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix,[75] and executives viewed him as having a bright future there.[59][76] At BCG, he was a colleague of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than 50 years.[77]
In 1977, he was hired by Bain & Company, a management consulting firm in Boston formed a few years earlier by [[Bill Bain]] and several other ex-BCG employees.[59][75][78] Bain later said of the 30-year-old Romney, "He had the appearance of confidence of a guy who was maybe ten years older."[79] Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then departed, Bain & Company  immersed itself in a client's businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented.[59][75] Romney became a vice president of the firm in 1978,[18] working with such clients as the [[Monsanto Company]], Outboard Marine Corporation, [[Burlington Industries]], and [[Corning Incorporated]].[73] Within a few years, the firm considered him one of its best consultants.
Romney set up a system in which any partner could veto one of these potential opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years.[59] The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start [[Staples Inc.]], after founder Thomas G.
Romney soon switched Bain Capital's focus from startups to the relatively new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, taking steps to improve the companies' value, and then selling those companies when their value peaked, usually within a few years.[59][79] Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns.[59] The firm invested in or acquired [[Accuride Corporation]], Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, [[Sealy Corporation]], [[Sports Authority]], and Artisan Entertainment, as well as some lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors.[59][79][94] Much of the firm's profit was earned from a relatively small number of deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.[nb 9]
Bain Capital's leveraged buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either soon after acquisition or later after the firm had concluded its role.[75][85][86] Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing to a lack of records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy for itself and its investors.[98][99][100] Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal.[86][101] Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy.[59][93][101] [[Dade Behring]] was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering).[98] Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary to save the life of the patient.
In 1990, facing financial collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return.[84] Announced as its new CEO in January 1991,[88][89] he drew a symbolic salary of one dollar[84] (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time).[88][89] He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's 1,000 employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency.[59][73][84] He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], to accept less than full payment.[102] Within about a year, he led Bain & Company to a return to profitability.[73] He then turned it over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.[59][103][104]
By 1993, Romney had begun thinking about entering politics, partly on Ann's urging and also to follow in his father's footsteps.[50] He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who was seeking reelection to a sixth term.
Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year, in part because of the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, and in part because this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which Kennedy's reputation had suffered.[119][120][121] Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994.[50] In addition to his leave from [[Bain Capital]], Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.[65]
Radio personality Janet Jeghelian took an early lead in polls among candidates for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat, but Romney proved the most effective fundraiser.[122][123] He won 68% of the vote at the May 1994 [[Massachusetts Republican Party]] convention; businessman John Lakian finished a distant second, eliminating Jeghelian.[124] Romney defeated Lakian in the September 1994 primary with more than 80% of the vote.[18][125]
For his campaign, Romney assembled a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters.[225][242] But he was little-known nationally, and hovered around 10% support in Republican preference polls for the first half of 2007.[214] He proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune.[225][243] These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner [[John McCain]]'s campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks.[244] Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; Romney himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.[225][245]
Romney endorsed McCain for president a week later,[262] and McCain had Romney on a short list for running mate, where his business experience would have balanced one of McCain's weaknesses.[264] Behind in the polls, McCain opted instead for a high-risk, high-reward "game changer", Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[265] McCain lost the election to Democratic senator [[Barack Obama]].
In July 2012, Romney visited the United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders in an effort to raise his credibility as a world statesman.[350] Comments he made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press.[351][352] Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.[353]
As the presidential election went into primary season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but was one of the Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman [[Donald Trump]].[416] Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a "bombshell" in them.[417] Trump responded by calling Romney "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics".[416] In a March 3, 2016 speech at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, Romney made a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances.
On June 7, 2020, in response to the murder of George Floyd and the worldwide protests against police brutality, Romney became the first Republican senator to participate in a protest alongside [[Black Lives Matter]].[470][471] He said, "We need many voices against racism and against brutality, and we need to make sure that people understand that Black Lives Matter."[472] This act drew praise and admiration from the left and right, with some Republicans questioning why other congressional Republicans were not showing support for the movement.
Romney declared his support for the [[Black Lives Matter]] international human rights movement by attending the rally,[534] and then joining the Faith Works[535] march, on June 7, 2020,[536] from southeast Washington,[535] past the Trump International Hotel,[534] and Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool,[534] over the murder of George Floyd.[536][534][535][537]
