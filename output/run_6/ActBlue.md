ActBlue[1] is an American [[Democratic Party]] political action committee (PAC) and fundraising platform founded in 2004.
Rahn and DeBergalis were joined in 2005 by [[Jonathan Zucker]] and Erin Hill.
Both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nominees, [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Joe Biden]], used ActBlue during their primary and general election campaigns.
[[Bernie Sanders]]' 2016 and 2020 primary campaigns also used ActBlue for fundraising.[8] Sanders' use of ActBlue was particularly notable as it represented the first time a major Democratic presidential candidate eschewed money from super PACs in favor of grassroots fundraising.[9] This strategy would later be replicated by other Democratic political figures like [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]].[10]
In the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], all the candidates used ActBlue.[11]
ActBlue reports the donors' names and amounts for all contributions processed to federal campaigns to the [[Federal Election Commission]], regardless of the amount.
In 2024, the [[Institute for Free Speech]] sued the FEC over the discrepancy whereby small donors utilizing conduits ActBlue or WinRed are automatically made public but same-sized direct donations are not.[22]
Over half of all donations in the following week went to charitable (non-political) causes, including one ActBlue page devoted to a bail fund which raised over $1.5 million from over 20,000 donors.[29] In the day following [[Death and state funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg|the death]] of Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], over $70 million was donated through ActBlue, again breaking the single-day fundraising record.[30]
In the first 24 hours following the launch of [[Kamala Harris]]'s presidential campaign, small-dollar and many first-time donors raised $81 million through ActBlue, making it the biggest 24 hour period ever on the platform for dollars raised sitewide.[32] Over the first weekend, they raised $100 million from 1.1 million donors.[33]
In 2024, Republican public officials in several states launched probes into ActBlue over allegations of donor fraud,[34] including Wyoming Secretary of State [[Chuck Gray]] and Virginia Attorney General [[Jason Miyares]].[35][36] ActBlue called Miyares's investigation a "partisan political attack and scare tactic".[37] ActBlue had previously been the target of fraud accusations by political activists, though experts in campaign finance law have expressed doubt about the veracity of these claims.[38][37][39][40]
