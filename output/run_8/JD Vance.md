Born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, Vance enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] in 2003 and was a military journalist throughout his four-year tenure until 2007.
After briefly working as a corporate lawyer, Vance became a venture capitalist at [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Mithril Capital]].
Vance also initiated a rapport with [[Peter Thiel]] after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.[24] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for David Frum's "FrumForum" website under the name J.
He spent a year as a law clerk for Judge David Bunning of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky,[32] then worked at the law firm Sidley Austin,[33] beginning a brief career as a corporate lawyer.[34] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a venture capitalist.[24] Between 2016 and 2017, he was a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, [[Mithril Capital]].[35][36]
Its chairman, Frederic Moll, said he hired Vance for his intelligence, legal qualifications, and connection to Thiel.[42][43] Vance tried to get [[Mithril Capital]] to invest in Circuit but Mithril passed.
Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[44] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Mithril's co-founder and managing director [[Mithril Capital#personnel|Ajay Royan]].
In another interview, he said elite tech crowds wielded "political-financial power in combination with a certain condescension".[44] In 2017, Vance joined [[Revolution LLC]],[46] an investment firm founded by [[Steve Case]].[46] Greenspon left Mithril and joined Vance at Revolution in 2018.[47][48] At Revolution Vance was tasked with expanding the "Rise of the Rest" initiative, which focuses on growing investments in underserved regions outside Silicon Valley and New York City.[46]
In 2019, Vance and Chris Buskirk co-founded the conservative political advocacy group Rockbridge Network.[55] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Marc Andreessen]].[56] In 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.[57] With Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in [[Rumble]], a Canadian online video platform popular with the political right.[58][59]
From March 2017 to April 2021, Vance was on the board of directors of the startup [[AppHarvest]], which carried out indoor vertical farming in Kentucky.
In early 2018, Vance considered running for the U.S. Senate against Sherrod Brown,[80] but did not.[81] In March 2021, [[Peter Thiel]] gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.[82][83][84] Robert Mercer also gave an undisclosed amount.[82] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by Rob Portman.[85] In May, he launched an exploratory committee.[86]
Several media and industry figures are said to have lobbied for Vance to be on the ticket, including [[Elon Musk]], [[David O.
Sacks]], Tucker Carlson, and [[Peter Thiel]], who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.[111][112] The Heritage Foundation, which drafted Project 2025, privately advocated for Vance.[113] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory".
Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing Catholic theology's alignment with his political views.[234][235][236] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by [[Peter Thiel]].[237] He was criticized by Pope Francis for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by invoking the traditional concept of ordo amoris present in Catholic theology, which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners[238] and equates with the slogan "America First".[239][240]
