The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) is a pivotal center-right think tank that leverages a sophisticated network of influence, power, and ideology to shape contemporary politics. Its strategic funding comes from elite political donors, including founding corporations like Bristol-Myers and Chrysler, specific foundations such as the Bradley Foundation, and a broad base of corporations and individuals, giving its operations a hidden but potent financial backing. AEI acts as a significant revolving door for policymakers and political operatives; figures like former President Gerald Ford, and high-ranking officials from the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations (e.g., Dick Cheney, John R. Bolton, Michael Ledeen, Richard Perle), have moved between government and AEI, often acting as controversial political operatives in advocating for policies such as the Iraq War and contributing to its strategic framework. Guided by key ideologues like Irving Kristol, a founding father of neoconservatism, AEI aggressively promotes free-market orthodoxy and often challenges established scientific consensus, exemplified by its criticism of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its disputed narratives on economic crises, as highlighted by critics like investigative journalist Jane Mayer and historian of science Naomi Oreskes, who point to corporate-funded disinformation. Internally, AEI demonstrates ideological control, with instances like David Frum's termination suggesting donor influence. Externally, its reach extends through affiliations with networks like the Atlas Network and State Policy Network, and direct engagement with international leaders, such as current president Robert Doar meeting with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and its deep ties to pro-Brexit British Conservative Party politicians, showcasing its disproportionate and strategic influence on both domestic and global conservative political discourse.
Brooks served as president of AEI from January 2009 through July 1, 2019.[9] He was succeeded by [[Robert Doar]].[10]
Brown.[11] AEI's founders included executives from [[Bristol-Myers]], [[Chemical Bank]], [[Chrysler]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], [[General Mills]], and [[Paine Webber]].[12]
AEA's early work in Washington, D.C. involved commissioning and distributing legislative analyses to Congress, which developed AEA's relationships with Melvin Laird and [[Gerald Ford]].[13] Brown eventually shifted AEA's focus to commissioning studies of government policies.
Baroody recruited a resident research faculty; Harvard University economist Gottfried Haberler was the first to join in 1972.[11] In 1977, former president Gerald Ford joined AEI as a "distinguished fellow." Ford brought several of his [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|administration officials]] with him, including Robert Bork, Arthur Burns, David Gergen, James C.
Baroody brought Jeane Kirkpatrick,  [[Irving Kristol]], Michael Novak, and Ben Wattenberg to AEI.[20]
While at AEI, Kirkpatrick authored "Dictatorships and Double Standards", which brought her to the attention of [[Ronald Reagan]], and Kirkpatrick was later named U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.[21] AEI also became a home for supply-side economists during the late 1970s and early 1980s.[22] By 1980, AEI had grown from a budget of $1 million and a staff of ten to a budget of $8 million and a staff of 125.[11]
During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], several AEI staff were hired by the administration.
In December 1986, AEI hired [[Christopher DeMuth]] as its new president,[14] and DeMuth served in the role for 22 years.[25]
In 1990, AEI hired Charles Murray (and received his [[Bradley Foundation]] support for The Bell Curve) after the Manhattan Institute dropped him.[26] During DeMuth's tenure, the organization turned further to the political right.[27]
Bush administration]].[29][30] More than 20 staff members served either in a Bush administration policy post or on one of the government's many panels and commissions, including [[Dick Cheney]] and [[John R.
AEI and several of its staff—including [[Michael Ledeen]] and [[Richard Perle]]—became associated with the start of the Iraq War.[32] Bush used a February 2003 AEI dinner to advocate for a democratized Iraq, which he said would inspire the remainder of the Mideast.[33][non-primary source needed] In 2006–07, AEI staff, including [[Frederick W.
On March 25, 2010, AEI resident fellow [[David Frum]] announced that his position at the organization had been "terminated."[43][44] Following this announcement, media outlets speculated that Frum had been "forced out"[45][46][47] for writing a post to his FrumForum blog called "Waterloo", in which he criticized the Republican Party's unwillingness to bargain with Democrats on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
In January 2019, [[Robert Doar]] was selected by AEI's board of trustees to be AEI's 12th president, succeeding Arthur Brooks on July 1, 2019.[50] In October 2023, Doar led an AEI delegation (including Kori Schake, Dan Blumenthal, Zack Cooper, and Nicholas Eberstadt, among others) to visit Taiwan to meet with President [[Tsai Ing-wen]].[51][52]
As of 2025, AEI's officers include [[Robert Doar]], Jason Bertsch, John Cusey, Kazuki Ko, Katheryne Walker, Kori Schake, Yuval Levin, Michael R.
The Council of Academic Advisers selects the annual winner of the [[Irving Kristol Award]].[54]
AEI is a member of the [[Atlas Network]] of free market think tanks[56] and is an associate member of the [[State Policy Network]] of conservative and libertarian think tanks.[57][better source needed]
In the 2000s, AEI was the most prominent think tank associated with American neoconservatism.[5] [[Irving Kristol]], widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of neoconservatism, was a senior fellow at AEI and the AEI issues an 'Irving Kristol Award' in his honour.[58][59] Paul Ryan has described the AEI as "one of the beachheads of the modern conservative movement".[60]
For instance, [[Sajid Javid]], [[Michael Gove]], [[Boris Johnson]], and [[Liz Truss]] have all made regular appearances at its World Forum and other events,[56] and [[Suella Braverman]] and [[Liam Fox]] have been hosted by it.[61][62][63]
In her book, Dark Money (2016), American investigative journalist [[Jane Mayer]] writes that contrary to their claims, AEI took the "lead role" in crafting a revisionist narrative about the financial crisis, promoting what equities analyst Barry Ritholtz called "Wall Street's 'big lie'".
Multiple studies, including those from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies and the [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]], did not support the conclusions about mortgages reached by AEI.
Some AEI staff and fellows have been critical of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the international scientific body tasked to evaluate the risk of climate change caused by human activity.[96][97] According to AEI, it "emphasizes the need to design environmental policies that protect not only nature but also democratic institutions and human liberty".[87]  American historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] notes that this idea became prominent during the conservative turn towards anti-environmentalism in the 1980s.
[[Christopher DeMuth]], former AEI president, accepted that the Earth has warmed in recent decades, but he stated that "it's not clear why this happened" and charged as well that the IPCC "has tended to ignore many distinguished physicists and meteorologists whose work casts doubt on the influence of greenhouse gases on global temperature trends".[126] Fellow James Glassman also disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, having written numerous articles criticizing the Kyoto accords and climate science more generally for Tech Central Station.[127] He supported the views of U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who claims that "global warming is 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,'"[128] and, like Green, cites Crichton's novel State of Fear, which "casts serious doubt on global warming and extremists who espouse it".[129] Joel Schwartz, an AEI visiting fellow, stated: "The Earth has indeed warmed during the last few decades and may warm further in the future.
In 2015, AEI gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu its [[Irving Kristol Award]].[133]
AEI's foreign and defense policy studies department, directed by Danielle Pletka, is the part of the institute most commonly associated with neoconservatism.[5] According to Vanity Fair, in 2002 it was seen "as the intellectual command post of the neoconservative campaign for regime change in Iraq".[41] Prominent foreign-policy neoconservatives at AEI include [[Richard Perle]], Gary Schmitt, and Paul Wolfowitz.[citation needed] Joshua Muravchik and [[Michael Ledeen]] (the latter seen as an "ultra neo-conservative"[134]) spent many years at AEI, although they departed at around the same time as Reuel Marc Gerecht in 2008 in what was rumored to be a "purge" of neoconservatives at the institute, possibly "signal[ing] the end of [neoconservatism's] domination over the think tank over the past several decades",[135] although Muravchik later said it was the result of personality and management conflicts.[136]
Bush, Christopher Cox, Douglas Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, Colin Powell, [[Ronald Reagan]], William Rehnquist, Condoleezza Rice, Margaret Thatcher, and William H.
Baroody Sr.]], invited [[Irving Kristol]] and Michael Novak to take up residence at AEI.
Supported by the [[Bradley Foundation]], AEI has hosted since 1989 the Bradley Lecture Series.
AEI received more than $1.6 million from the Charles Koch Foundation between 2011 and 2016, over $5 million from conservative donor advised funds DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund between 2012 and 2016, over $1.7 million from the Sarah Scaife Foundation between 2012 and 2016, $480,000 from the [[Bradley Foundation]] from 2012 to 2016, and $425,000 from the Coors Foundation between 2011 and 2016.[57]
