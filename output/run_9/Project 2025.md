Project 2025 is a strategic initiative spearheaded by the **Heritage Foundation**, a powerful conservative think tank led by **Kevin Roberts**, aiming to fundamentally reshape the U.S. federal government by consolidating executive power and implementing right-wing policies, which Roberts frames as "institutionalizing Trumpism." **Donald Trump** is the central political figure, whose administration officials heavily contribute to the plan and whose second-term actions are closely aligned with its proposals, despite his attempts to distance himself. The project's extensive network, including over 100 partner organizations (some identified as extremist), is significantly funded by "dark money" contributions tied to **Leonard Leo**, an elite conservative donor with substantial influence over judicial appointments. Key political operatives and ideological figures like **Paul Dans**, **Russell Vought** (whose **Center for Renewing America** drafts executive orders and promotes Christian Nationalism, and who is linked to the **Republican National Committee**), and **Stephen Miller** (a controversial former Trump advisor leading **America First Legal**) actively develop policies, prepare personnel, and align the project with the official party apparatus. Other figures such as **JD Vance**, **John McEntee**, **Christopher Miller**, **Peter Navarro**, **Spencer Chretien**, and **Roger Severino** further illustrate the deep integration of Project 2025's architects and supporters across the conservative movement and a potential Trump administration, collectively exerting disproportionate influence to dismantle the administrative state, infuse Christian nationalist ideology into government, and centralize presidential control.
Project 2025 (also known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project)[3] is a political initiative published in April 2023 by [[The Heritage Foundation|the Heritage Foundation]] think tank to reshape the federal government of the United States and consolidate executive power in favor of right-wing policies.[4] It constitutes a policy document that suggests specific changes to the federal government, a personnel database for recommending vetting loyal staff in the federal government, and a set of proposed executive orders for the U.S. president to implement those policies.[5][6]
Most of Project 2025's contributors worked in either [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump's first administration]] (2017−2021) or [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the 2024 presidential election.[a] Several Trump campaign officials maintained contact with Project 2025, seeing its goals as aligned with their Agenda 47 program.[31][42][43][44] Trump later attempted to distance himself from the plan.[b] After he won the 2024 election, he nominated several of the plan's architects and supporters to positions in [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|his second administration]].[52][53] Four days into his second term, analysis by Time found that nearly two-thirds of [[List of executive actions by Donald Trump|Trump's executive actions]] "mirror or partially mirror" proposals from Project 2025.[54]
Vice President [[JD Vance]] wrote the foreword to Roberts's book Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America.[60] Some have claimed that Vance is connected to Project 2025 through shared views on policy matters.[61][62][63][64]
Project 2025 was established in 2022 with [[Paul Dans]] as director to provide the 2024 Republican presidential nominee with a personnel database and ideological framework.[65][43] According to the Johnson Amendment, 501(c)(3) organizations like Heritage cannot explicitly promote a particular election candidate.[66] The Heritage Foundation spent $22 million preparing staffing recommendations for a conservative government in 2025.
In April 2023, the Heritage Foundation published the 920-page Mandate, written by hundreds of conservatives.[14] Nearly half of the project's collaborating organizations have received dark money contributions from a network of fundraising groups linked to [[Leonard Leo]], a major conservative donor and key figure in guiding the selection of Trump's federal judicial nominees.[73]
Some of the authors worked for Amazon, Meta, and bitcoin companies directly or as lobbyists.[74] One expert claimed inconsistencies in the plan are designed for fund-raising from certain industries or donors that would benefit.[75]
In May 2024, [[Russell Vought]] was named policy director of the [[Republican National Committee]] platform committee.[87] The [[Russell Vought#Center for Renewing America|Center for Renewing America]] (CRA), founded by Vought, is on Project 2025's advisory board.[88] CRA drafted executive orders, regulations, and memos that could have laid the groundwork for rapid action on Trump's plans when he won.[89] The CRA identified Christian Nationalism as one of the top priorities for the second Trump term.[23] Vought claimed that Trump blessed the CRA, and that his effort to distance himself from Project 2025 was just politics.[89] Vought was Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget during his first term[23] and was reappointed to the position for the second term.[90]
In July 2024, [[Stephen Miller]], a former Trump advisor, sought to remove his organization, [[America First Legal]], from the Project 2025 list of advisory board members.[91] Before leaving Project 2025, he appeared in a promotional video for it.[92] In November 2024, he was appointed as an advisor to the White House for Trump's second term.[93][94]
[[John McEntee]], a senior advisor for Project 2025 and former Trump aide, said the project was doing valuable work in anticipation of Trump's second term.[98][99]
Before his second term, many Project 2025 contributors were expected to have positions in the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|second Trump administration]],[80] and the administration was expected to use the database of potential federal employees the project recruited and trained.[48] Peter Navarro, one of Mandate's authors, was appointed Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing.[102]
Project 2025 released a statement on July 5 saying the project "does not speak for any candidate or campaign" and that it is up to "the next conservative president" to decide which of its recommendations to implement.[72] In July 2024, Trump reiterated his disavowal of Project 2025,[105][106][107] but in the same month Project 2025 Director [[Paul Dans]] confirmed that his team had ongoing connections with Trump's campaign.[43] During the week of July 29, Dans told Project staff that he would step down as director in August to focus on the election campaign.[108][109] Kevin Roberts assumed leadership of the project.[110]
[[Roger Severino]] is vice president of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation.
Project 2025 is split on the issue of foreign trade.[111] Mandate author [[Peter Navarro]] advocates what he calls a "fair trade" policy of reciprocal, higher tariffs on the European Union, China, and India, to achieve a balance of trade, though not all U.S. levies are lower than those of its major trading partners.[127] On the other hand, Mandate author Kent Lassman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute promotes a free trade policy of lowering or eliminating tariffs to cut costs for consumers, and calls for more free trade agreements.[127] He argues that Trump's and Biden's tariffs have undermined not just the American economy, but also the nation's international alliances.[121]
In 2023, [[Stephen Miller]] proposed immediately mobilizing the military at the start of second Trump administration for domestic law and immigration enforcement under the Insurrection Act of 1807.[21] Jeffrey Clark, a senior fellow at CRA and Project 2025 contributor, has investigated using the Insurrection Act for other purposes, including suppressing protests like the George Floyd protests.[22] The Heritage Foundation denied Project 2025 planned to use the Insurrection Act, but Mandate has a single line that says it is possible to use the Insurrection Act to secure the southern border.[22][154] Russell Vought said the CRA was working to keep legal and defense communities from preventing use of the Insurrection Act.[155]
Project 2025 proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees in order to replace them with Trump loyalists.[31] It established a personnel database shaped by the [[Ideology of Donald Trump|ideology of Donald Trump]].
In 2020, White House Presidential Personnel Office employees [[Executive Office appointments by Donald Trump|James Bacon]] and John McEntee developed a questionnaire to test potential government employees' commitment to Trumpism.
[[Stephen Miller]], a key architect of immigration policy during the Trump presidency, is a major figure in Project 2025.[77] In November 2023, Miller told Project 2025 participant Charlie Kirk that the operation would rival the scale and complexity of "building the Panama Canal".
Roberts has said that although Trump has appeared in Playboy magazine and had [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal|an affair with a porn actor]], he could still be a powerful advocate against pornography because "our Lord works with imperfect instruments".[203][204] When the Republican Party nominated him for president in 2016, Trump signed a pledge to examine the "public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture".
On September 24, 2024, Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts was due to release the book Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America, with a foreword by Republican vice-presidential nominee [[JD Vance]].[62][60] The book was initially subtitled Burning Down Washington to Save America.[62][60]
The Biden campaign launched a website critical of Project 2025 hours before his [[Joe Biden–Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate|June 27 debate with Trump]].[78][232] Kamala Harris continued the focus on Project 2025 when she became the Democratic presidential nominee.[74] Public awareness of Project 2025 rose after Biden's and Harris's campaigns brought attention to it and said it would be Trump's agenda.[74][233] The focus on opposition to Project 2025 increased during the transition from Biden to Harris as the nominee.[74] In August 2024, an oversize copy of The Mandate was used as a prop during the 2024 Democratic National Convention.[234][235][236]
After Trump won the 2024 election, he nominated several Project 2025 contributors to positions in his second administration.[52] His choice to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, wrote the manifesto's chapter about the agency.[246] Tom Homan, picked by Trump to act as a "border czar", also contributed to the Project 2025 document.[247] Trump nominated [[Russell Vought]] to direct the Office of Management and Budget.
