The Scaife Foundations, particularly the Sarah Scaife Foundation and Scaife Family Foundation, established by Richard Mellon Scaife, constitute a significant network of elite political donors dedicated to exerting strategic and ideological influence on contemporary politics. These foundations provided substantial financial backing to numerous ideological think tanks, including the George C. Marshall Institute, the highly influential Project for the New American Century (PNAC), and the Institute for Humane Studies, thereby shaping conservative policy and intellectual discourse. Their funding also supported media outlets like the Reason Foundation and RealClearInvestigations, along with controversial political operatives such as Judicial Watch, amplifying the dissemination of specific conservative narratives and active political engagement. This network notably wielded disproportionate influence, including its role in the "climate change counter-movement." While control of the Scaife Family Foundation under Jennie later saw a shift away from conservative political funding, the broader Scaife legacy remains crucial to understanding the financing of right-wing influence at national and international levels.
