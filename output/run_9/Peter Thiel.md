Peter Andreas Thiel, a prominent venture capitalist and self-described conservative libertarian, serves as a central architect and financier of an influential network deeply embedded in contemporary politics and strategic sectors. Through his primary venture capital firm, Founders Fund, Thiel deploys capital into 'hard tech' and national security startups like Palantir Technologies and Anduril, with Palantir controversially enabling government surveillance and Anduril (founded by Thiel's mentee Palmer Luckey) securing advantageous defense contracts, notably from US Customs and Border Protection. This network extends to strategic energy assets through General Matter (uranium enrichment, with Thiel on the board) and controversial surveillance technology via Clearview AI. Thiel's ideological influence, established early through The Stanford Review (funded by Irving Kristol), is further amplified by the Thiel Foundation and Thiel Fellowship, which cultivate a cadre of entrepreneurs like Delian Asparouhov, fostering new ventures that expand his reach. His political activism includes significant donations to right-wing causes and explicit support for pro-Donald Trump candidates, even leading him to depart the Facebook (Meta Platforms) board where he previously exerted ideological sway over Mark Zuckerberg. This evolving network, including a consortium led by Palantir and Anduril with OpenAI, SpaceX, Scale AI, and Saronic Technologies, and collaborative defense incubators like Valinor Enterprises with General Catalyst and Red Cell Partners, strategically integrates cutting-edge technology into defense and intelligence, challenging traditional power structures and exerting disproportionate influence over political and national security landscapes.
Peter Andreas Thiel (/tiːl/ ⓘ; born 11 October 1967) is a German and American[1][2][3][4] entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist.[5][6][7] A co-founder of PayPal, [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Founders Fund]], he was the first outside investor in Facebook.[8][9] According to Forbes, as of May 2025, Thiel's estimated net worth stood at US$20.8 billion, making him the 103rd-richest individual in the world.[10] Thiel has been described as "perhaps America's leading public intellectual today",[11] or "intellectual architect of Silicon Valley's contemporary ethos".[12] Others debate the consistency or morality of his views.[13][N 1][15][16]
He co-founded [[Valar Ventures]] in 2010, founded Thiel Capital in 2011, co-founded Mithril Capital in 2012, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017.[19][20][21][22] He was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011, which later became controversial in New Zealand.
Through the [[Thiel Foundation]], Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and [[Thiel Fellowship]].
The replacement of a "Western Culture" program at Stanford with a "Culture, Ideas and Values" course that addressed diversity and multiculturalism prompted Thiel to co-found [[The Stanford Review]], a conservative and libertarian newspaper, in 1987.
The paper received funding from [[Irving Kristol]].[34] Thiel was The Stanford Review's first editor-in-chief until he graduated in 1989.
On 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting and would leave after 17 years in order to support pro–[[Donald Trump]] candidates in the 2022 United States elections.[62][83]
The fund casts [[Palantir Technologies|Palantir]], [[Anduril Industries|Anduril]] and the newly minted nuclear startup General Matter as the three parts of a trilogy, to which it hopes to add others, among which a plan for onshoring ultraviolet light lithography.[89]
In addition to Facebook, the Founders Fund made early-stage investments in numerous startups, including Airbnb,[31] Slide.com,[91] LinkedIn,[31] Friendster,[92] RapLeaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Spotify,[31] Practice Fusion, MetaMed, Vator, [[SpaceX]],[31] IronPort, Votizen, Asana, Big Think, CapLinked, Nanotronics Imaging, Powerset (Thiel is on the board of Nanotronics and Powerset[93]), Stripe, Bullish Global (the parent company Block.one had also received investment from Thiel [94]), AltSchool,[95] Trade Republic,[96] PsiQuantum (photonic quantum computing),[97] and Rigetti Computing (superconducting quantum computing).[98] Thiel also backed DeepMind, a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for £400 million.[99] Founders Fund is an important backer of the Berlin-based platform ResearchGate.[100]
Also in 2017, Thiel was one of the first outside investors in [[Clearview AI]], a facial recognition technology startup that has raised concerns in the tech world and media for its risks of weaponization.[102]
In 2024, alongside [[General Catalyst]] and Red Cell Partners, the Founders Fund incubated the defense incubator Valinor Enterprises.
Anduril is a defense hardware startup that was founded in 2017 by [[Palmer Luckey]] (who is Thiel's mentee), Joe Chen, [[Trae Stephens]], Matt Grimm and Brian Schimpf (the latter three are Palantir and Founders Fund alumni).[114][115] The Founders Fund backed the company since its inception, leading its 2017 seed round.
The $1 billion (part of the $2.5 billion Series G funding round) the Founders Fund invested in Anduril in June 2025 was the largest investment in the fund's history.[116][117] In  December 2024, it was reported that Palantir and Anduril were forming a consortium of new generation defense companies (which included [[SpaceX]], [[OpenAI]], [[Scale AI]], Saronic Technologies and others) that they would lead in order to challenge the dominance of traditional defense companies.[118] In July 2025, when the Trump administration's budget bill included a provision that required border surveillance towers to be "tested and accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deliver autonomous capabilities", Edith Olmsted of The New Republic made the criticism that the government favoured Peter Thiel's business, as the provision (which only Anduril fulfilled) effectively ruled out Anduril's rivals, namely General Dynamics and the Israeli-based Elbit Systems.[119][120]
[[General Catalyst]] is also heavily involved in its financing and organization.[234][235][236] The fund invests in Line Next (a unit of the Line Corporation), a joint venture between Softbank and Naver.[237] The Business Korea credits Crescendo Equity Partners with transforming Korea's HPSP, which it invested in since 2017, into a global player in the semiconductor equipment sector.
In 2024, it recruited [[Donald Trump Jr.]] as a partner.[288][289]
The Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures are backers of the Hill & Valley Forum, a group that is described by the Wall Street Journal as an anti-China alliance between Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill.[372][373] In an article named Silicon soldiers of fortune, the China Daily, the channel of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party,[374] identifies Thiel, [[Palmer Luckey]] and Jacob Helberg as tech hawks who are increasingly shaping the US policy towards China.[375] The Xinhua News Agency, China's official state news agency,[376] states that Palantir and its leaders like Thiel and Vice President Wendy R.
According to The Intercept, Thiel is the source of the warrior culture in Silicon Valley, one focused on an arms race with China, although the anti-China sentiment is found on both sides of the political spectrum.[388] [[Alex Karp]] notes that Palantir has a warrior culture, which values excellence over money.[389][390]
Thiel initially supported Carly Fiorina's campaign during the 2016 GOP presidential primary elections.[431] After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported [[Donald Trump]] and became one of the California delegates for Trump's nomination.
He was a headline speaker during the 2016 Republican National Convention, during which he announced that he was proud to be gay, Republican, and American, for which the assembled Republicans cheered.[432][433] On 15 October 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]].[434]
Thiel stated to The New York Times: "I didn't give him any money for a long time because I didn't think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to."[435] After Trump's victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the president-elect's [[First presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]].[436]
In December 2015, [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence, announced that Thiel was one of its financial backers.[456]
In The Social Network, Thiel was portrayed by Wallace Langham.[550] He described the film as "wrong on many levels".[551] His distaste for the portrayal led to the establishment of the [[Thiel Fellowship]] on a whim.[552]
