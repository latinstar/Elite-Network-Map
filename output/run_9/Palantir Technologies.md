Palantir Technologies Inc. is a critical node in contemporary politics, fundamentally shaped by co-founder Peter Thiel's ideological vision of 'techno-militarism' and a 'pro-America ethos,' significantly bankrolled by his venture firm, Founders Fund. CEO Alex Karp openly champions Palantir's role in forging a 'union of the state and the software industry' for American global supremacy. This strategic influence is manifested through extensive, often controversial, contracts with key government bodies, including the United States Intelligence Community, the United States Department of Defense, FBI, DHS, and NSA, facilitated by early advocacy from figures like DoD official John Poindexter and initial investment from In-Q-Tel (a CIA venture capital arm). Administrations like the Trump administration have utilized Palantir for functions enabling deportations and data aggregation, drawing significant criticism. Former Vice President Joe Biden's public endorsement further integrated Palantir into federal operations. The company's global reach, exemplified by its deals with the NHS in the UK, sparks intense debate from tech-justice nonprofits like Foxglove and medical bodies such as the British Medical Association and Doctors Association UK, who raise concerns about data privacy and ethics. Furthermore, journalist Whitney Webb, whose theories are published by MintPress News (described as a 'Russian web of disinformation') and Kris Millegan's Trineday, controversially links Palantir and Thiel to the CIA, Mossad, and the Jeffrey Epstein network, alleging a darker, coordinated effort towards an 'Orwellian nightmare.' Palantir's partnerships with defense contractors like Anduril Industries and Northrop Grumman also underscore its embedding within the military-industrial complex, consolidating a network of strategic influence over national security, public services, and geopolitical power dynamics.
is an American publicly traded company specializing in software platforms for data.[3] Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it was founded in 2003 by [[Peter Thiel]],[4] Stephen Cohen,[5] Joe Lonsdale,[6] [[Alex Karp]],[7] and Nathan Gettings.[8][9]
Palantir Gotham is an intelligence tool used by militaries and counter-terrorism analysts, including the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (USIC) and [[United States Department of Defense]].
Palantir has been criticized for its involvement in expanding government surveillance through [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies.[21][22] Some former employees and critics have raised concerns about its contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], which enable [[Deportation in the second Trump administration|deportations]] and the aggregation of sensitive data on Americans.[23][24] Supporters argue that Palantir does not collect or store data itself but rather provides software that helps clients analyze data they already possess, while clients retain control and rights over their own information.
The same year, Thiel hired [[Alex Karp]], a former colleague of his from Stanford Law School, as chief executive officer.[31]
According to Gilman Louie, head of [[In-Q-Tel]] (a venture capital corporation associated with the CIA and the intelligence community[32][33]), after Thiel recruited Karp, the two founders came to him with some ideas but no clear problem to solve.
Palantir evolved from that software when Thiel proposed the company to Karp and Cohen.[35] According to Wired, in 2004, Thiel and Karp met [[John Poindexter]], a Department of Defense official who recognized their "interesting idea" and helped them gather "a legion of advocates from the most influential strata of government".
In its early years its work included a subprime lender study for Center for Public Integrity and analyses of Somali piracy, Hezbollah, and the platform used to detect the Chinese GhostNet.[44] Palantir said computers alone using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] could not defeat an adaptive adversary.
She also links Palantir and Thiel to the CIA, [[Mossad]], and the Epstein network's alleged plan to create "an Orwellian nightmare".
She has published these theories on the Chinese version of [[MintPress News]], a far-left site known for being part of the "Russian web of disinformation",[47][48][49] and through Trineday, a publisher found by the conspiracy theorist[50] Kris Millegan.[51][52][53] The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs describes Webb as a MintPress journalist.[54]
In April 2010, Palantir announced a partnership with Thomson Reuters to sell the Palantir Metropolis product as "QA Studio" (a quantitative analysis tool).[55] On June 18, 2010, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag held a press conference at the White House announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB).
A document leaked to TechCrunch revealed that Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least 12 groups in the U.S. government, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the DHS, the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], the United States Military Academy, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
In September 2013, Palantir disclosed over $196 million in funding, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[63][64] It was estimated that the company would likely sign almost $1 billion in contracts in 2014.[65] CEO [[Alex Karp]] announced in 2013 that the company would not pursue an IPO, as going public would make "running a company like ours very difficult."[66] In December 2013, the company began a round of financing, raising around $450 million from private funders.
If completed, Forbes said Palantir's funding could reach $1.2 billion.[66] As of December 2014, the company continued to have diverse private funders, Ken Langone and Stanley Druckenmiller, [[In-Q-Tel]] of the CIA,[67] Tiger Global Management, and [[Founders Fund]], a venture firm operated by Thiel.[66]
As of May 2025,[update] the second Trump administration had spent $113 million on existing and new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and The Pentagon plus a contract of $795 million with the DOD, while deliberating contracts for the [[Social Security Administration]] and the Internal Revenue Service.[24]
As of 2021, the company had invested over $400 million into nearly two dozen [[Special-purpose acquisition company|special-purpose acquisition company]] (SPAC) targets according to investment bank RBC Capital Markets, while bringing alongside those companies as customers.[98]
It is an evolution of Palantir's longstanding work in the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and is used by intelligence and defense agencies.
In November 2023, NHS England awarded Palantir a 7-year contract for a federated data platform to access data from different systems through a single system, worth £330 million, criticized by the [[British Medical Association]], [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors Association UK]] and cybersecurity professionals.[103][104][105] In 2024, medical professionals picketed outside NHS England HQ, demanding cancellation of the deal.[106]
The company demonstrated its use in war, where a military operator could deploy operations and receive responses via an AI chatbot.[108][109] Citing potential risks of [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative artificial intelligence]], Karp said the product would not let the AI independently carry out targeting operations, but would require human oversight.[110][111] Commercial companies have also used AIP across many domains.
After being prototyped with IRAD funds, the project is now developed in partnership with [[Anduril Industries]], [[Northrop Grumman]], and other contractors.
Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the [[United States Intelligence Community]] and [[United States Department of Defense]], fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).
Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, [[FBI]], the Marine Corps, the Air Force, [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies.
Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and [[FBI]] were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually.
Hunter complained of [[United States Department of Defense]] obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[140]
Liam Fox encouraged the firm "to expand their software business" in Britain.[150] It was said to be "critical to the success of the vaccination and PPE programmes", but its involvement with the NHS was controversial among civil liberties groups.[151] Conservative MP [[David Davis]] called for a judicial review into the sharing of patient data with Palantir.[152]
In March 2023, it was revealed that NHS hospitals had been ordered to share patient data with Palantir, prompting renewed criticism from civil liberties groups, including for supporting genocide, privacy and security practices, and "buying their way in".[104][158] Groups including the [[The Doctors' Association UK|Doctors' Association UK]], National Pensioners' Convention, and Just Treatment subsequently threatened legal action over NHS England's procurement of the FDP contract, citing concerns over the use of patient data.[159]
In 2024, Irish politician and former Palantir employee Eoin Hayes was suspended by his party, the [[Social Democrats]], for saying at a press conference that he had sold shares in Palantir before he entered politics, when he had sold the shares a month after being elected as a city councillor.
Palantir's partnership with [[Anduril Industries]] extends to many areas.
Palantir also partners with the traditional defense "primes": Boeing (specifically its defense and space unit),[197] Lockheed Martin,[198] [[Northrop Grumman]] (TITAN system),[199] and General Dynamics (through General Dynamics Land System).[200]
Palantir has been criticized for its role in expanding government surveillance using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition software]].[21][22] Some former employees and critics say the company's contracts under the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|second Trump Administration]], which enable deportations and the aggregation of sensitive data on Americans across administrative agencies, are problematic.[23][24] Others observe that Palantir does not collect or store data, but only helps analyze data that customers have already collected and provides services and platforms where customers retain the rights.
Palantir CEO [[Alex Karp]] ended all ties to HBGary and issued a statement apologizing to "progressive organizations ...
According to required financial disclosures, Stephen Miller, who as United States homeland security advisor has been actively involved in the [[Second Trump administration|second Trump administration]]'s deportation efforts, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of Palantir stock; some Trump critics have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest.[253][254][255] Similar financial disclosure requirements of U.S. government employees show that at least 10 other members of the Trump administration own Palantir stock.[256] Advocacy groups such as the Alliance for Secure AI have also criticized Palantir's use of AI during the second Trump administration.[257][258]
The German version of the Marxist[275] publication Jacobin has written that while Palantir does not steal data or carry out surveillance activity, its increased power in Germany is still worrisome, considering the founders' non-democratic tendencies, and that [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and Alliance 90/The Greens also carry responsibility.[276] The European has written that Thiel and Karp cause themselves trouble by trying to creating a mysterious aura, which leads to a negative reaction to Palantir software despite its usefulness in civilian and defense applications.[277]
