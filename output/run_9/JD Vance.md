James David Vance's political ascent, culminating in his role as Vice President, is significantly shaped by a powerful network of elite political donors, venture capitalists, and ideological operatives. **Peter Thiel** emerges as a central figure, providing substantial financial backing to Vance's venture capital firm **Narya Capital**, funding the Super PAC **Protect Ohio Values** for his campaigns, employing him at **Mithril Capital**, and actively lobbying for his selection as **Donald Trump**'s running mate. Other influential venture capitalists and donors, including **Eric Schmidt**, **Marc Andreessen**, **Robert Mercer**, **Elon Musk**, and **David O. Sacks**, have channeled significant capital into Vance's ventures and political campaigns. Vance's career also leverages a robust ideological infrastructure comprising think tanks like the **American Enterprise Institute (AEI)**, implicated in controversial ties to **Purdue Pharma** through figures like **Sally Satel**, and conservative training organizations such as **American Moment**, which is affiliated with **Project 2025**. Advocacy groups like the **Rockbridge Network**, co-founded by Vance and **Chris Buskirk**, and the controversial **Our Ohio Renewal**, managed by operative **Jai Chabria**, further extend this influence. Additionally, media platforms like **Rumble**, invested in by Vance, Thiel, and **Darren Blanton**, alongside influential media personalities such as **Tucker Carlson** and controversial operatives like **Lance Wallnau** (known for election denialism), and political family members **Donald Trump Jr.** and **Eric Trump**, played crucial roles in advocating for Vance's rise within the **Republican Party**. This network demonstrates a strategic convergence of wealth, media, and conservative ideology to exert disproportionate and often hidden influence over contemporary political events.
A member of the [[Republican Party]], he represented Ohio in the United States Senate from 2023 to 2025.
After briefly working as a corporate lawyer, Vance became a venture capitalist at [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Mithril Capital]].
After [[Never Trump movement#Former Never Trumpers|opposing Donald Trump's candidacy]] in the 2016 election, Vance became a strong Trump supporter during Trump's first presidency and was selected as his running mate in the 2024 election.
Vance also initiated a rapport with [[Peter Thiel]] after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.[24] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for David Frum's "FrumForum" website under the name J.
He spent a year as a law clerk for Judge David Bunning of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky,[32] then worked at the law firm Sidley Austin,[33] beginning a brief career as a corporate lawyer.[34] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a venture capitalist.[24] Between 2016 and 2017, he was a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, [[Mithril Capital]].[35][36]
Its chairman, Frederic Moll, said he hired Vance for his intelligence, legal qualifications, and connection to Thiel.[42][43] Vance tried to get [[Mithril Capital]] to invest in Circuit but Mithril passed.
Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[44] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Mithril's co-founder and managing director [[Mithril Capital#personnel|Ajay Royan]].
In 2019, Vance was on the board of advisors of the [[With Honor Fund]], a Super PAC that helps veterans run for office.[52] From 2020 to 2023, he was on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with [[Project 2025]].[53][54]
In 2019, Vance and [[Chris Buskirk]] co-founded the conservative political advocacy group [[Rockbridge Network]].[55] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Marc Andreessen]].[56] In 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.[57] With Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in [[Rumble]], a Canadian online video platform popular with the political right.[58][59]
In December 2016, Vance said he planned to move to Ohio and would consider starting a nonprofit or running for office.[60][39] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other "social ills" he had mentioned in his memoir.[61] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the advisory board members were Keith Humphreys, Jamil Jivani, [[Yuval Levin]], and [[Sally Satel]].[62][63] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence.[64] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements.[61][65] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's cancer diagnosis.[66][67] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent most of its revenue on overhead costs and travel.
Vance denied the characterization.[69][70][b] Our Ohio Renewal's tax filings show that in its first year, it spent more (over $63,000) on "management services" provided by its executive director [[Jai Chabria]], who was Vance's top political adviser, than it did on programs to fight opioid abuse.[74][63] In 2017, Vance formed a similarly named 501(c)(3) organization, Our Ohio Renewal Foundation, which raised around $69,000 from 2017 to 2023.[68] As of September 2024, the foundation had not spent any funds since 2019.[75]
According to the Associated Press (AP) and a 2019 ProPublica investigation, the charity's biggest accomplishment, sending psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] to Ohio's Appalachian region for a yearlong residency in 2018, was "tainted" by the ties among Satel, her employer, American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and [[Purdue Pharma]], in the form of knowledge exchange between Satel and Purdue and financial support from Purdue to AEI.
In early 2018, Vance considered running for the U.S. Senate against Sherrod Brown,[80] but did not.[81] In March 2021, [[Peter Thiel]] gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.[82][83][84] [[Robert Mercer]] also gave an undisclosed amount.[82] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by Rob Portman.[85] In May, he launched an exploratory committee.[86]
At midnight on January 10, Vance resigned from the Senate in anticipation of his inauguration as vice president of the United States on [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump|January 20]].[104] On January 17, Governor Mike DeWine announced his appointment of Jon Husted to the Senate seat Vance vacated.[105]
On January 31, 2023, Vance endorsed former president Donald Trump in the [[2024 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[106][107] On July 15, 2024, the first day of the Republican National Convention, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had chosen Vance as his running mate.[108] On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate.[109]
Along with Vance, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and South Carolina senator Tim Scott were finalists to be Trump's running mate.[110] Trump's two eldest sons, [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]], advocated for Vance.
Several media and industry figures are said to have lobbied for Vance to be on the ticket, including [[Elon Musk]], [[David O.
Sacks]], [[Tucker Carlson]], and [[Peter Thiel]], who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.[111][112] [[The Heritage Foundation]], which drafted [[Project 2025]], privately advocated for Vance.[113] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory".
At the time of his comments, Harris had not publicly discussed the [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign#Arlington National Cemetery incident|incident]].[126][127][128]
In late September 2024, Vance spoke at a western Pennsylvania town hall event organized by [[Lance Wallnau]], who has promoted election denialism and called Kamala Harris a "demon".[132][133][134] In October 2024, Vance said he did not believe Trump lost the 2020 presidential election and that he believed "Big Tech rigged the election" through censorship.[135]
In a 2020 podcast interview, he said that being childless "makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable".[141] Vance's campaign referred to "radical childless leaders in this country" in a fundraising email sent after his appearance on [[Tucker Carlson Tonight]].
Among Vance's first acts as vice president was swearing in Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the first of Trump's cabinet nominees to be approved by Congress, on January 21.[167] On January 24, he cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense.[168] In February 2025, after multiple federal judges issued temporary rulings against various [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] actions, Vance wrote, "judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power".[169]
Vance has been described as a national conservative,[185][186] right-wing populist,[185][187] and an ideological successor to paleoconservatives such as Pat Buchanan.[188] Vance describes himself, and has been described by others, as a member of the postliberal right.[189][190][191][192] He has said he was influenced by Catholic social teaching.[193] He has endorsed books by Kevin Roberts, president of [[The Heritage Foundation|the Heritage Foundation]], and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec.[194][195]
Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing Catholic theology's alignment with his political views.[234][235][236] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by [[Peter Thiel]].[237] He was criticized by Pope Francis for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by invoking the traditional concept of ordo amoris present in Catholic theology, which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners[238] and equates with the slogan "America First".[239][240]
