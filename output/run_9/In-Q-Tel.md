In-Q-Tel (IQT) operates as a strategic venture capital firm, directly supporting the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the broader U.S. Intelligence Community, including the DIA and NGA, by investing in cutting-edge technologies. Conceived by former CIA Director George Tenet, In-Q-Tel exemplifies a powerful network where venture capital influences national security capabilities, often with hidden investments. This network extends to the military-industrial complex, with Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, having chaired In-Q-Tel's board. It also links to major tech corporations, demonstrated by In-Q-Tel's funding of Keyhole, Inc., which Google later acquired to form Google Earth, showcasing how intelligence-driven investments can profoundly shape pervasive civilian technology. Elite figures like William J. Perry and Stephen Friedman have served on In-Q-Tel's board, with a Wall Street Journal investigation highlighting that many trustees had financial connections to companies funded by In-Q-Tel, suggesting potential conflicts of interest and a system where private financial gain is intertwined with strategic intelligence objectives.

In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of [[Google]], worth over US$2.2 million, on November 15, 2005.[12] The share transfer was a result of Google's acquisition of Keyhole, Inc, the CIA-funded satellite mapping software now known as [[Google Earth]].[13]
