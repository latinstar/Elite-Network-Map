The text reveals a network where Sally L. Satel, a conservative psychiatrist and fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), acts as a key operative shaping health policy discourse. AEI, an ideological think tank, serves as a platform for Satel's views, notably receiving funding from corporate entities like Purdue Pharma. Purdue Pharma strategically engaged with Satel and AEI, including reviewing drafts of her articles, to influence public opinion and policy regarding opioids amidst legal challenges, illustrating corporate power subtly shaping medical narratives. Satel's past roles on government bodies such as the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the advisory committee of the Center for Mental Health Services of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration further connect her ideologically driven perspectives directly to official policy-making. Additionally, JD Vance, a prominent political figure, through his non-profit Our Ohio Renewal, demonstrates how elite political figures utilize organizations and operatives to exert targeted, ideological influence on critical issues like the opioid crisis in specific regions.
Satel (born January 9, 1956)[1] is an American psychiatrist based in Washington, D.C. She is a lecturer at Yale University School of Medicine, a visiting professor of psychiatry at Columbia University,[2] a senior fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], and an author.
In 1993 and 1994, Satel was a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow with the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions]].[3]
Satel is a resident scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), a conservative think tank.[3]
In 2004, as [[Purdue Pharma]], a company known as the maker of OxyContin, one of the many drugs abused in the opioid epidemic in the United States, was facing a threat to its sales due to rising lawsuits against it, Satel wrote an op ed for the New York Times arguing that law enforcement was being overzealous, that patients require large doses of opioids to relieve pain, and that OxyContin is rarely the only drug found in autopsies of oxycodone-related deaths but typically those addicted to it use multiple drugs.
In February 2019, Columbus Monthly reported that a non-profit set up by Hillbilly Elegy author [[JD Vance]] called [[Our Ohio Renewal]] was sponsoring Satel to take a one year residency in southern Ohio (an area hit by the opioid crisis), with the Ironton-Lawrence Community Action Agency, based in areas along the Ohio River near Portsmouth, Ohio.[6] According to reason.com, she moved to Ironton in 2018.[7]
