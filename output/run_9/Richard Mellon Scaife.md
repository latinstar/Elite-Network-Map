Richard Mellon Scaife, an elite political donor drawing from the vast Mellon family fortune, exerted extensive and often hidden influence through a meticulously funded network of conservative and libertarian organizations. His strategic philanthropy, channeled via private foundations like the Sarah Scaife Foundation, Carthage Foundation, Allegheny Foundation, and the Scaife Family Foundation (later controlled by David Scaife), empowered influential ideological think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation (where he served as vice-chairman), Hoover Institution, American Enterprise Institute, and Cato Institute. This funding also propelled powerful political action committees including the Free Congress PAC and Club for Growth Inc. PAC. Scaife's ownership and significant investment in media outlets like the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Newsmax Media (co-founded by controversial operative Christopher Ruddy), and the Western Journalism Center (headed by Joseph Farah), provided platforms to shape public opinion, disseminate conservative narratives, and propagate conspiracy theories, notably concerning the Clintons and even referencing the CIA. This network further involved political operatives like Ruddy and Rex Armistead, and showcased high-level attempts at media manipulation, such as John Ehrlichman's suggestion for Scaife to acquire The Washington Post. Scaife's support for international policy groups like CSIS, NED, and FPRI, alongside his association with figures like Kenneth Starr, demonstrates a broad and disproportionate impact on both domestic and foreign policy discourse, underscoring his strategic leadership in groups like "The League to Save Carthage" to influence contemporary political events.
Richard Mellon Scaife (/skeɪf/; July 3, 1932 – July 4, 2014) was an American billionaire, a principal heir to the [[Mellon family|Mellon]] banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, and the owner and publisher of the [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]].
Scaife was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Alan Magee Scaife, the head of an affluent Pittsburgh family, and Sarah Cordelia Mellon, who was a member of the influential [[Mellon family]], one of the most powerful families in the country.[6] Sarah was the niece of former United States Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W.
She and her brother, financier R.K. Mellon, were heirs to the Mellon fortune that included [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] and major stakes in Gulf Oil and Alcoa aluminum.
He essentially created a newspaper from the ground up and named it the [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] while maintaining the Greensburg operation separately.
Scaife paid freelancer [[Christopher Ruddy]] to write about the Foster case for the Tribune-Review and other right-leaning media.[citation needed] Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, appointed to investigate Clinton, concluded Foster had, in fact, committed suicide.[17]
In 2004, Scaife was reported to own 7.2 percent of [[Newsmax|Newsmax Media]], a news-based Web site with conservative political content founded by Ruddy in 1998.[18] In 2009, Scaife reportedly controlled 42% of NewsMax, with Ruddy the 58% majority owner, CEO and editor.[19]
Following Robert Duggan's suicide and then Watergate, he shifted his political giving from politicians' campaigns to anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications.[23] During the scandal, [[John Ehrlichman]] suggested having Scaife buy out The Washington Post in a hostile takeover from Katharine Graham in order to halt Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting.[24]
Scaife also funded the [[Western Journalism Center]], headed by [[Joseph Farah]].
Through contacts made at Hoover and elsewhere, Scaife became a major, early supporter of [[The Heritage Foundation]], which has since become one of Washington's most influential conservative public policy research institutes.
Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] was named the first dean of this school.
Scaife hired [[Rex Armistead]] and a reporter from the Tribune-Review to investigate whether or not Kangas had been out to kill Scaife.[47]
