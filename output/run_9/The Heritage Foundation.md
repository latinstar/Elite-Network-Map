The Heritage Foundation, a powerful right-wing ideological think tank, serves as a central nexus for a significant network of influence in contemporary U.S. politics. Founded by figures like Paul Weyrich and Edwin Feulner, and heavily financed by elite political donors such as Joseph Coors and Richard Mellon Scaife through entities like the Scaife Family Charitable Trust, Heritage strategically shapes policy and administrations. Its advocacy arm, Heritage Action, amplifies its influence. Under presidents like Jim DeMint and Kevin Roberts, Heritage has actively sought to "institutionalize Trumpism" through initiatives like Project 2025, which aims to staff federal agencies with ideologically aligned individuals and dismantle government structures. This influence was profoundly demonstrated during the Donald Trump administration, where numerous Heritage alumni, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions, were appointed to key positions, often with direct intervention from Heritage leadership. The network further extends through a revolving door, with controversial political operatives and former Trump administration officials like Ken Cuccinelli, Mark A. Morgan, Chad Wolf, and Mike Pence joining Heritage to promote specific narratives, including false claims about elections or controversial ideological stances (e.g., Jason Richwine and Robert Rector's views on race and IQ). The organization exhibits strong ideological control, leading to internal dissent and resignations from figures like Thomas Spoehr and Luke Coffey over policy reversals or mandated silence. Beyond domestic politics, Heritage engages in international ideological networking, as seen in its cooperation with the state-funded Danube Institute. The network's strategic importance is underscored by a cyberattack on its donor data, potentially linked to China's Ministry of State Security spy agency.
The Heritage Foundation has had significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and has historically been ranked among the most influential public policy organizations in the United States.[7] In 2010, it founded a sister organization, [[Heritage Action]], an influential activist force in conservative and Republican politics.[8][9][10][11]
The foundation was established on February 16, 1973, during the Nixon administration by [[Paul Weyrich]], [[Edwin Feulner]], and [[Joseph Coors]].[15][16][17] Growing out of the new business activist movement inspired by the Powell Memorandum,[18][19][20] Weyrich and Feulner sought to create a conservative version of the Brookings Institution that advanced conservative policies.[15][6]
Coors was Heritage's earliest funding source,[17] seeding the organization with an initial $250,000.[6] Billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]] followed up a year later, using the [[Scaife Foundations|Scaife Family Charitable Trust]] to donate tens of millions to the foundation over the next two decades as its primary donor.[21] Weyrich was the foundation's first president.
In April 2005, The Washington Post reported that the Heritage Foundation softened its criticism of the Malaysian government after Heritage Foundation president [[Edwin Feulner]] initiated a business relationship with Malaysian prime minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]].
Feulner, Heritage's president, began representing Malaysian business interests" through his relationship with [[Belle Haven Consultants]].[39][40] The foundation denied a conflict of interest, saying that its views on Malaysia changed following the country's cooperation with the U.S. after the September 11 attacks,[41] and the Malaysian government "moving in the right economic and political direction."[42][43]
In April 2010, partly inspired by the model of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, founded by the progressive Center for American Progress, the foundation launched [[Heritage Action]] as a sister 501(c)4 organization designed to expand Heritage's political influence and reach.[8][46] The new group quickly became influential.[8][9]
In December 2012, [[Jim DeMint]], then a U.S. senator from South Carolina, announced that he intended to resign from the U.S. Senate to replace Feulner as the foundation's president.[52] As Heritage Foundation president, DeMint was paid $1 million annually, making him the highest-paid think tank president in Washington, D.C., at the time.[53][54]
In May 2013, [[Jason Richwine]], a senior fellow at the foundation, resigned after his Harvard University Ph.D. thesis, authored in 2009, and comments he made at a 2008 American Enterprise Institute forum, drew extensive media scrutiny.
In his thesis and at in the earlier American Enterprise Institute forum, Richwine argued that Hispanics and Blacks are intellectually inferior to whites with a supposed predisposition to lower IQs, leading them to struggle in assimilating.[57][58] A foundation study that month by Richwine and [[Robert Rector]] also was widely criticized across the political spectrum for methodology the two used in criticizing immigration reform legislation.[59] Reason magazine and the Cato Institute criticized it for failing to employ dynamic scoring, which Heritage previously incorporated in analyzing other policy proposals.[60][61]
In June 2015, [[Donald Trump]] announced his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
In July 2015, appearing on a Fox News panel, [[Michael Needham]], leader of [[Heritage Action]], the foundation's advocacy arm, said, "Donald Trump's a clown.
The following month, in August, a Heritage Foundation economic writer, [[Stephen Moore]], criticized Trump's policy positions, saying, "the problem for Trump is that he’s full of all of these contradictions.
He’s kind of a tabula rasa on policy."[66] In December 2015, then Heritage Foundation executive vice president [[Kim Holmes]], authored an essay opposing Trump and his candidacy for Public Discourse, published by the Witherspoon Institute, a Princeton, New Jersey-based think tank, which criticized Trump as "not a conservative." Holmes also criticized Trump supporters, writing that, "they are behaving more like an alienated class of Marxist imagination than as social agents of stability and tradition.
They are indeed thinking like revolutionaries, only now their ire is aimed at their progressive masters and the institutions they control," he wrote.[67] Then Heritage president [[Jim DeMint]] "praised both Rubio and Cruz, but said that he couldn’t 'make a recommendation coming from Heritage'."[68]
Following Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, the Heritage Foundation obtained influence in his [[First presidential transition of Donald Trump|presidential transition]] and [[First presidency of Donald Trump|administration]].[70][56][71] The foundation had a say in the staffing of the administration with CNN reporting in January 2017 that, "no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition."[70] One reason for the Heritage Foundation's disproportionate influence relative to other conservative think tanks, CNN reported, was that other conservative think tanks had "Never Trump" staff during the 2016 presidential election, while the Heritage Foundation ultimately signaled that it would be supportive of him.[70][56]
Drawing from a database that the foundation began building in 2014 of approximately 3,000 conservatives it trusted to serve in a hypothetical Republican administration, at least 66 foundation employees and alumni were hired into the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump's first presidential term]].[56] According to employees involved in developing the foundation's database, several hundred people from the database ultimately entered the Trump administration and at least five, [[Betsy DeVos]], [[Mick Mulvaney]], [[Rick Perry]], [[Scott Pruitt]], [[Jeff Sessions]], became members of Trump's cabinet.[56] [[Jim DeMint]], president of the foundation from 2013 to 2017, personally intervened on behalf of Mulvaney, who ended up heading the Office of Management and Budget and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and later served as Trump's acting White House chief of staff.[56]
In a public statement, the foundation's board said that, following a thorough investigation of the foundation's operations under DeMint's management, they found "significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation." "While the organization has seen many successes," the board said in the statement, "Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems."[72] DeMint's firing was praised by some, including former U.S. representative Mickey Edwards (R-OK), who said he saw it as a step to pare back the foundation's partisan edge and restore its reputation as a pioneering think tank.[72] In January 2018, [[Kay Coles James]] succeeded DeMint as the foundation's president.
In February 2021, after Trump lost reelection, the Heritage Foundation hired three former Trump administration officials, [[Ken Cuccinelli]], [[Mark A.
Morgan]], and [[Chad Wolf]], who held various roles in immigration-related functions in the Trump administration.
At the same time, Heritage also hired former U.S. vice president [[Mike Pence]] as a distinguished visiting fellow.
The foundation's positions and management under [[Kay Coles James]] drew criticism from conservatives and Trump allies, which intensified in 2020 and 2021.
In March 2021, in response to mounting criticism of her leadership of the foundation, James and executive vice president [[Kim Holmes]] resigned from the foundation.[83]
In October 2021, the Heritage Foundation announced that [[Kevin Roberts]], who previously led a state-based think tank, Texas Public Policy Foundation and was a member of Texas governor Greg Abbott's COVID-19 task force, would replace James as the foundation's new president.[83][84] According to the foundation's filing with the Internal Revenue Service, Roberts was compensated $953,920 annually as of 2023.[85]
In March 2023, the Heritage Foundation established a cooperative relationship with the [[Danube Institute]], a Budapest-based state-funded think tank founded in 2013.[90]
Following the 2020 presidential election, in which President [[Donald Trump]] made baseless claims of fraud after he was defeated for reelection, the Heritage Foundation launched a campaign in support of Republican efforts to make state voting laws more restrictive.[164][165]
In March 2021, The New York Times reported that the Heritage Foundation's political arm, [[Heritage Action]], planned to spend $24 million over two years across eight key states to support efforts to restrict voting, in coordination with the Republican Party and allied conservative outside groups, including the Susan B.
On January 21, 2024, after three years of silence on Trump's position that Biden was an illegitimate president and that Trump actually won the 2020 election, Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a reporter for The New York Times, presented the question to Heritage president [[Kevin Roberts]]: "Do you believe that President Biden won the 2020 election?" "No", Roberts replied.[168]
In May 2022, [[Heritage Action]], the Heritage Foundation's political activism organization, announced its opposition to the $40 billion military aid package for Ukraine passed that month following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, completely reversing the organization's previous position of support for such aid.[191][192] The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy director at the time, Luke Coffey, said he was ordered to retract his earlier statements supporting aid to Ukraine; he subsequently left the foundation.[88]
In 1973, businessman [[Joseph Coors]] contributed $250,000 to establish the Heritage Foundation and continued to fund it through the Adolph Coors Foundation.[202][203] The foundation's trustees have historically included individuals affiliated with Chase Manhattan Bank, Dow Chemical, General Motors, Mobil, Pfizer, Sears, and other corporations.[204]
For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, CharityWatch reported that [[Edwin Feulner]], the Heritage Foundation's past president, received the highest compensation in its top 25 list of compensation received by charity members.
The foundation's president, [[Kevin Roberts]], was compensated $953,920 annually in 2023.[85]
