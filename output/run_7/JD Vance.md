A member of the [[Republican Party]], he [[Seniority in the United States Senate|represented]] Ohio in the [[United States Senate]] from 2023 to 2025.
Born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, Vance enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] in 2003 and was a military journalist throughout his four-year tenure until 2007.
After briefly working as a corporate lawyer, Vance became a venture capitalist at [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Mithril Capital]].
After [[Never Trump movement#Former Never Trumpers|opposing Donald Trump's candidacy]] in the 2016 election, Vance became a strong Trump supporter during Trump's first presidency and was selected as his running mate in the 2024 election.
During his tenure as vice president, he has been the finance chair of the [[Republican National Committee]].
In 2007, Vance left the military and used the G.I. Bill[19][20] to study at Ohio State University.[21] He graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude in political science and philosophy.[22] In 2010, Vance entered Yale Law School,[23] where he worked with a group of editors to check citations for The Yale Law Journal.[24] At Yale Law School, he befriended fellow Ohio native and future Republican politician [[Vivek Ramaswamy]].[25][26] During his first year, Professor Amy Chua persuaded Vance to begin writing his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.[7][27]
Vance also initiated a rapport with [[Peter Thiel]] after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.[24] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for [[David Frum]]'s "FrumForum" website under the name J.
After graduating from law school, Vance worked for Republican senator [[John Cornyn]].
He spent a year as a law clerk for Judge David Bunning of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky,[32] then worked at the law firm Sidley Austin,[33] beginning a brief career as a corporate lawyer.[34] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a venture capitalist.[24] Between 2016 and 2017, he was a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, [[Mithril Capital]].[35][36]
In June 2016, Harper published Vance's book, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.[7] The memoir recounts the Appalachian culture and socioeconomic problems of Vance's upbringing.[37] Hillbilly Elegy was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] in [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2016|2016]] and [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2017|2017]].
The Times listed it among "6 Books to Help Understand Trump's Win",[38] and Vance was profiled in [[The Washington Post]], which called him "the voice of the Rust Belt".[39] In [[The New Republic]], Sarah Jones criticized Vance as "liberal media's favorite white trash–splainer" and a "false prophet of blue America", calling the book "little more than a list of myths about welfare queens".[40] Hillbilly Elegy's success helped propel Vance into contact with social elites, and he began writing a column for The New York Times.
Its chairman, Frederic Moll, said he hired Vance for his intelligence, legal qualifications, and connection to Thiel.[42][43] Vance tried to get [[Mithril Capital]] to invest in Circuit but Mithril passed.
Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[44] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Mithril's co-founder and managing director [[Mithril Capital#personnel|Ajay Royan]].
He decided to leave in 2017.[43] Bloomberg reports he deleted all traces of Mithril from his LinkedIn profile.[45] Vance moved back to Ohio, where he published an op-ed in [[The New York Times]] with the headline "Why I'm moving home", in which he complained about "highly educated transplants" in Silicon Valley.
In another interview, he said elite tech crowds wielded "political-financial power in combination with a certain condescension".[44] In 2017, Vance joined [[Revolution LLC]],[46] an investment firm founded by [[Steve Case]].[46] Greenspon left Mithril and joined Vance at Revolution in 2018.[47][48] At Revolution Vance was tasked with expanding the "Rise of the Rest" initiative, which focuses on growing investments in underserved regions outside Silicon Valley and New York City.[46]
Vance was a [[CNN]] contributor in 2017 and 2018.[49]
In 2019, Vance was on the board of advisors of the [[With Honor Fund]], a Super PAC that helps veterans run for office.[52] From 2020 to 2023, he was on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with [[Project 2025]].[53][54]
In 2019, Vance and [[Chris Buskirk]] co-founded the conservative political advocacy group [[Rockbridge Network]].[55] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Marc Andreessen]].[56] In 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.[57] With Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in [[Rumble]], a Canadian online video platform popular with the political right.[58][59]
In December 2016, Vance said he planned to move to Ohio and would consider starting a nonprofit or running for office.[60][39] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other "social ills" he had mentioned in his memoir.[61] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the advisory board members were [[Keith Humphreys]], [[Jamil Jivani]], [[Yuval Levin]], and [[Sally Satel]].[62][63] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence.[64] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements.[61][65] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's cancer diagnosis.[66][67] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent most of its revenue on overhead costs and travel.
During Vance's 2022 U.S. Senate campaign, [[Tim Ryan]], the Democratic nominee, said the charity was a front for Vance's political ambitions.
Vance denied the characterization.[69][70][b] Our Ohio Renewal's tax filings show that in its first year, it spent more (over $63,000) on "management services" provided by its executive director [[Jai Chabria]], who was Vance's top political adviser, than it did on programs to fight opioid abuse.[74][63] In 2017, Vance formed a similarly named 501(c)(3) organization, Our Ohio Renewal Foundation, which raised around $69,000 from 2017 to 2023.[68] As of September 2024, the foundation had not spent any funds since 2019.[75]
According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and a 2019 [[ProPublica]] investigation, the charity's biggest accomplishment, sending psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] to Ohio's Appalachian region for a yearlong residency in 2018, was "tainted" by the ties among Satel, her employer, American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and [[Purdue Pharma]], in the form of knowledge exchange between Satel and Purdue and financial support from Purdue to AEI.
In early 2018, Vance considered running for the U.S. Senate against [[Sherrod Brown]],[80] but did not.[81] In March 2021, [[Peter Thiel]] gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.[82][83][84] [[Robert Mercer]] also gave an undisclosed amount.[82] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by [[Rob Portman]].[85] In May, he launched an exploratory committee.[86]
Vance announced his Senate campaign in Ohio on July 1, 2021.[3] On May 3, 2022, he won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote,[87] defeating multiple candidates, including [[Josh Mandel]] (23%) and [[Matt Dolan]] (22%).[88] On November 8, in the general election, Vance defeated Democratic nominee [[Tim Ryan]] with 53% of the vote to Ryan's 47%.[3][89] This vote share was considered a vast underperformance compared to other Ohio Republicans, especially in the coinciding gubernatorial election.[90] Vance had often previously spelled his name with periods after his initials ("J.D.")—including in the publication of Hillbilly Elegy—but after becoming a candidate for office, he removed the periods ("JD").[1]
On January 3, 2023, Vance was sworn into the Senate as a member of the [[118th United States Congress]].
On March 1, 2023, Vance and Senator [[Sherrod Brown]] co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to prevent derailments like the one in East Palestine,[92][93] but the bill failed due to lack of intra-caucus Republican support.[94][95][96] In June 2023, Vance voted against raising the debt ceiling, standing against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[97] and saying it would result in "a reduced military in the face of a rising threat from China".[98]
Vance became Ohio's senior senator on January 3, 2025, upon the swearing-in of [[Bernie Moreno]].
At midnight on January 10, Vance resigned from the Senate in anticipation of his inauguration as vice president of the United States on [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump|January 20]].[104] On January 17, Governor Mike DeWine announced his appointment of [[Jon Husted]] to the Senate seat Vance vacated.[105]
On January 31, 2023, Vance endorsed former president Donald Trump in the [[2024 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[106][107] On July 15, 2024, the first day of the Republican National Convention, Trump announced on [[Truth Social]] that he had chosen Vance as his running mate.[108] On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate.[109]
Along with Vance, North Dakota governor [[Doug Burgum]], Florida senator [[Marco Rubio]], and South Carolina senator [[Tim Scott]] were finalists to be Trump's running mate.[110] Trump's two eldest sons, [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]], advocated for Vance.
Several media and industry figures are said to have lobbied for Vance to be on the ticket, including [[Elon Musk]], David O.
Sacks, [[Tucker Carlson]], and [[Peter Thiel]], who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.[111][112] [[The Heritage Foundation]], which drafted [[Project 2025]], privately advocated for Vance.[113] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory".
On May 15, 2024, Trump attended a $50,000 per head private fundraising dinner with Vance in Cincinnati.[118] Guests included Chris Bortz and Republican fundraiser [[Nate Morris]].[119] Vance appeared at significant conservative political events and in June was described as a potential running mate for Trump.[120][121] In July, a former friend of Vance's from Yale Law School exposed to the media communications between them and Vance from 2014 to 2017, with the friend alleging that Vance has "changed [his] opinion on literally every imaginable issue that affects everyday Americans" in pursuit of "political power and wealth".[122][123]
At the time of his comments, Harris had not publicly discussed the [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign#Arlington National Cemetery incident|incident]].[126][127][128]
In late September 2024, Vance spoke at a western Pennsylvania town hall event organized by [[Lance Wallnau]], who has promoted election denialism and called Kamala Harris a "demon".[132][133][134] In October 2024, Vance said he did not believe Trump lost the 2020 presidential election and that he believed "Big Tech rigged the election" through censorship.[135]
Shortly after being named Trump's running mate, Vance was criticized for saying in a 2021 [[Fox News]] interview, "we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."[136] The resurfaced comments, which were posted by [[MeidasTouch]] editor-in-chief [[Ron Filipkowski]], sparked an immediate backlash across news and social media.[137][138] On July 26, 2024, Vance clarified his remarks on [[The Megyn Kelly Show]], saying, "It's not a criticism of people who don't have children" and "this is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child".[139] He has said that being "pro-babies and pro-family" should be the Republican Party's highest priority.[140]
In a 2020 podcast interview, he said that being childless "makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable".[141] Vance's campaign referred to "radical childless leaders in this country" in a fundraising email sent after his appearance on [[Tucker Carlson Tonight]].
In July 2024, a CNN poll analysis after the Republican National Convention showed a net-negative approval rating for Vance.[90] That week, Vance's middling public reception and other concerns led some prominent Republican politicians and political analysts to say that he may have been a poor choice of running mate, especially in light of the shift in the election's dynamics upon [[Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election|the withdrawal of President Biden]] from the election and advent of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.[162]
Among Vance's first acts as vice president was swearing in Secretary of State [[Marco Rubio]], the first of Trump's cabinet nominees to be approved by Congress, on January 21.[167] On January 24, he cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense.[168] In February 2025, after multiple federal judges issued temporary rulings against various [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] actions, Vance wrote, "judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power".[169]
Vance has been described as a national conservative,[185][186] right-wing populist,[185][187] and an ideological successor to paleoconservatives such as Pat Buchanan.[188] Vance describes himself, and has been described by others, as a member of the postliberal right.[189][190][191][192] He has said he was influenced by Catholic social teaching.[193] He has endorsed books by Kevin Roberts, president of [[The Heritage Foundation|the Heritage Foundation]], and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec.[194][195]
Vance wrote in his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, that he was raised in a low-income family by his single mother and grandmother.[7][223] In 2013, Vance met Usha Chilukuri while both were students at Yale Law School.[224] On June 14, 2014, they married in Kentucky in an interfaith marriage ceremony;[225][226] she is Hindu and he is Christian.[225] The wedding included a Bible reading by Vance's "best friend", [[Jamil Jivani]],[66][227] and the bride and groom were blessed by a Hindu pandit.[224][228] Usha clerked for a year for Brett Kavanaugh, at the time an appeals court judge in Washington, then clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts for a year.[229]
Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing Catholic theology's alignment with his political views.[234][235][236] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by [[Peter Thiel]].[237] He was criticized by Pope Francis for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by invoking the traditional concept of ordo amoris present in Catholic theology, which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners[238] and equates with the slogan "America First".[239][240]
