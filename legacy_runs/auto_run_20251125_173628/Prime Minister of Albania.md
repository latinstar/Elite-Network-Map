The prime minister of Albania,[a]  officially the prime minister of the Republic of Albania,[b] is the [[Head of government]] of [[Albania]].
The office of the prime minister is a core institution in the [[Politics of Albania]] formed after the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] on 28 November 1912.
Since that time, the nation has navigated a dynamic political evolution spanning distinct periods, encompassing a [[Principality of Albania]], a [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] and the eventual [[History of Albania#Fourth Republic]].
In 1912, [[Ismail Qemali]] was inaugurated as the first prime minister of Albania, guiding the nation toward sovereignty amidst the complex conditions in the [[Balkans]].
In 1944, [[Enver Hoxha]] implemented a radical change in government, transforming Albania into an authoritarian and isolationist communist regime.
In 1991, the nation [[Fall of communism in Albania]] that marked a notable shift, when [[Fatos Nano]] emerged as the first post-communist prime minister of Albania.
The office of the prime minister is defined by the [[Constitution of Albania]].
The appointment begins with [[Elections in Albania]], during which parties or political coalitions nominate candidates for the [[Parliament of Albania]].
After the results are certified, the [[President of Albania]] invites the majority leader to propose a prime ministerial candidate who must secure a majority from the parliament for selection.
Once selected, the prime minister-elect is mandated to partake in a formal [[Oath of office]] ceremony presided over by the president.
The prime minister is in charge of forming and guiding the [[Council of Ministers (Albania)]], presenting the nation's integral policies and coordinating government institutions.
Located in [[Tirana]], the [[Prime Minister's Office (Albania)]] is the official workplace of the prime minister and holds a crucial role in facilitating their duties and those of the council.
Since September 2013, [[Edi Rama]] from the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] has served as prime minister.
Following the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] on 28 November 1912, the establishment of the office of the prime minister became an integral part of the constitutional framework of Albania.[2] Amidst the formative period characterised by tumultuous political and regional conflicts, a series of distinguished ministers assumed the position, each confronted with distinct challenges that left a lasting impact on Albanian politics.
[[Ismail Qemali]] occupied the mantle of the first prime minister and directed the Albanian people toward the realisation of [[Independent Albania]].[3] Subsequently, during their respective tenures as prime ministers from 1914 to 1920, [[Turhan Përmeti]] and [[Essad Pasha Toptani]] were instrumental in directing Albania through the challenges of [[World War I]].[4] This period was marked by their dedication to preserving the nation's independence in the face of shifting alliances and external interventions.[5] Similarly, the emergence of [[Ilias Vrioni]] as prime minister in 1920 occurred in the aftermath of World War I, and Vrioni addressed border disputes with the backing of several major Western nations that guaranteed Albania's sovereignty within the boundaries formed in 1913.[6] Following these developments, [[Zog I of Albania]] served as prime minister in 1922, concentrating on centralising power, modernising the economy and attracting foreign investments.[7] In 1924, [[Fan Noli]]'s brief tenure saw the introduction of sweeping reforms, including initiatives in education and land distribution aimed at reshaping the socio-economic landscape, alongside the establishment of the [[Albanian Orthodox Church]].[8] Zogu returned as prime minister for a second term in 1925 and further solidified his influence, ultimately transitioning the nation into a monarchy in 1928, with himself as [[King of Albania]].[9]
With the global crisis of the [[Great Depression]], Albania grappled with significant economic and financial challenges from 1930 to 1939.
During this period, a succession of prime ministers, including [[Kostaq Kotta]], [[Pandeli Evangjeli]] and [[Mehdi Frashëri]], led the nation.
Amid [[World War II]], despite declaring [[Neutral country]], Albania was invaded by Italy.[10] Prime Ministers of the era, including [[Shefqet Vërlaci]] and [[Mustafa Merlika-Kruja]], assumed significant roles in navigating the challenges posed by foreign occupation.
In 1943, Germany occupied the nation, leading to the brief prime ministerial tenures of [[Rexhep Mitrovica]], [[Fiqri Dine]] and [[Ibrahim Biçakçiu]] during the occupation.[11] With the conclusion of World War II in Albania, the nation entered an unprecedented transformative phase under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]], who acceded to the mantle of prime minister in 1944.
Hoxha's tenure was marked by a commitment to [[Marxism–Leninism]], resulting in the establishment of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] in 1946.[12] The regime faced multifaceted challenges, encompassing widespread poverty, illiteracy, healthcare crises, and gender inequality.[13][14] In response, Hoxha initiated a comprehensive modernisation effort aimed at achieving economic and social progress and transitioning Albania into an industrialised society.[15] [[Mehmet Shehu]] served as a prominent figure in Hoxha's government, holding the position of prime minister for a significant part of the communist period, from 1954 to 1981.[16] He played an essential part in implementing the government's policies and exerting influence over the nation's direction.[17] [[Adil Çarçani]] succeeded Shehu as prime minister and maintained the position for nine years, maintaining Albania's isolationist stance in external affairs and alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries.[18]
After the [[Fall of communism in Albania]], the office of the prime minister of Albania was restored and a democratic order was established.[19] Responding to widespread protests in December 1990, the government of [[Ramiz Alia]] of the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] granted its approval for the first [[Multi-party system]] in [[1991 Albanian parliamentary election]] and the subsequent elections in [[1992 Albanian parliamentary election]].[20] This resulted in the legal recognition of the opposition [[Democratic Party of Albania]] and paved the way for the admission of other political parties, including the [[Socialist Party of Albania]].[21] Subsequently, [[Fatos Nano]] emerged as the first post-communist prime minister on 22 February 1991.
Nano prioritised the establishment of democratic institutions, the implementation of economic reforms and the reintegration of Albania into the international community.[22][23] On 4 June 1991, Nano resigned from office due to political and social pressure, allowing [[Ylli Bufi]] and [[Vilson Ahmeti]] to assume the mantle for a short period, respectively.[24][25] During their tenures, Albania became a member of the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE).[26] [[Aleksandër Meksi]] became prime minister on 13 April 1992 following the Democratic Party's victory in [[1992 Albanian parliamentary election]].[27] His cabinet was dedicated to further advancing democratic and economic development and strengthening Albania's international connections.[28][29][30] This commitment culminated to the nation's accession to the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) in July 1995.[31] However, the tenure of Meksi faced criticism for what some perceived as an increasingly authoritarian approach and allegations of corruption.[32] One of the most notable events during his rule was the outbreak of the [[1997 Albanian civil unrest]] that resulted in a humanitarian crisis and an international intervention.[33]
Following the departure of Meksi on 25 March 1997, [[Bashkim Fino]] emerged as prime minister with a commitment to holding early [[1997 Albanian parliamentary election]].[34][35] Fatos Nano secured his second term as prime minister but faced several challenges, notably in assembling a cabinet, which led to his resignation.[36] [[Pandeli Majko]] succeeded Nano as prime minister on 28 September 1998 and focused on the preservation of public order and the fight against corruption and organised crime.[37][38][39][40] His cabinet garnered approval for a new [[Constitution of Albania]] through a [[1998 Albanian constitutional referendum]], all amidst continued instability in, and a large influx of refugees from, Albanian-speaking [[Kosovo]].[41][40][42] With the resignation of Majko on 29 October 1999, [[Ilir Meta]] emerged as prime minister and served until his resignation on 29 January 2002.[43][44][45] Following Majko's return for his second term on 7 February 2002, Nano assumed the mantle for his third term as prime minister until 3 July 2005.[46][47] In the [[2005 Albanian parliamentary election]], [[Sali Berisha]] emerged as prime minister with a dedication to sustainable economic development and advancing Albania toward [[European Union]] (EU) and [[NATO]] (NATO) membership.[48] The tenure of Berisha achieved a major milestone when the nation secured NATO membership in April 2009.[49][50] However, his leadership was marred by increasing allegations of corruption, misappropriation of public funds and interference in public processes.[51] Edi Rama occupied the role as prime minister for three consecutive terms following his party's victory [[2013 Albanian parliamentary election]].[52][53] Under his guidance, Albania achieved consistent economic growth and made continuous progress toward EU membership through a series of reforms aimed at socio-economic revitalisation, reinforcement of the rule of law, enhancement of the judicial system and transparency in governance.[52][53][54]
The process of selecting the prime minister of Albania begins with the conducting of [[Elections in Albania]], in which the members of the [[Parliament of Albania]] are elected through a [[Proportional representation]] for four-year terms.[55][56] Political parties or coalitions nominate their candidates for the [[Member of parliament]].[57] The leader of the party or coalition which secures the most seats in the parliament emerges as a contender for the role of the prime minister.[58] Once the election results receive official certification, the [[President of Albania]] extends an invitation to the leader of the party or coalition with the parliamentary majority, urging them to propose a candidate for the position.[58] The nominated candidate subsequently seeks approval from the parliament, with the members of the parliament casting their votes either in favor or against the proposed candidate.[58] The candidate must garner a majority of affirmative votes to secure appointment, thereby confirming their selection as the prime minister.[58] In the event that the appointed prime minister does not secure approval from the parliament, a 10-day window is provided for the president to nominate a new candidate.[58] If, once more, the parliament does not endorse this subsequent nominee, it is granted an additional 10-day period to designate an alternative prime minister.[58] If the parliament remains unable to successfully elect a new prime minister within these defined timeframes, the president retains the prerogative to dissolve the parliament.[58]
Before assuming the office, the prime minister-elect is mandated to partake in a formal [[Oath of office]] ceremony presided over by the president.[59] The ceremony, conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the constitution, marks the commencement of the minister's official functions.

Located at [[Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard]] in [[Tirana]], the [[Prime Minister's Office (Albania)]] operates as the official workplace of the prime minister and assumes a central role in facilitating the functions of the prime minister and the council of ministers.[60][61][62] According to the [[Constitution of Albania]], the office of the prime minister holds an integral position in the executive arm of government as the [[Head of government]].[63] One of the core functions of the prime minister is to form and lead the [[Council of Ministers (Albania)]], which include the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Albania]] and several other ministers.
The prime minister has the ability to propose a [[Motion of no confidence]] to the parliament, focusing on significant matters related to bill or decision approval.[65] This motion cannot involve investigations, appointments, immunity or parliamentary functioning.
Importantly, a motion of confidence cannot be proposed during the consideration of a motion of no confidence.[65] When the prime minister is absent or incapacitated, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Albania]] assumes the role of second-in-command to maintain the uninterrupted functioning of the government.[61] Their appointment and dismissal are determined by the council of ministers based on the recommendation of the prime minister.[1]
