Real school ([[German language]]: Realschule, pronounced [ʁeˈaːlʃuːlə] ⓘ) is a type of [[Secondary school]] in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].
It has also existed in [[Croatia]] (realna gimnazija), the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[German Empire]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] (realskole), [[Sweden]] (realskola), [[Estonia]] (reaalkool), [[Finland]] (reaalikoulu), [[Hungary]] (reáliskola), [[Latvia]] (reālskola), [[Slovenia]] (realka), [[Serbia]] (realna gimnazija/realka), and the [[Russian Empire]] (реальное училище), including [[Partitioned Poland]] (szkoła realna).
In the German [[Secondary school]] system, Realschule is ranked between [[Hauptschule]] (lowest) and [[Gymnasium (school)]] (highest).
They can also attend a Berufsschule or do an [[Apprenticeship]].
In some states, Realschulen have recently been replaced by [[Oberschule]] or [[Sekundarschule]].
At Realschule, a student gets an extended education and learns at least one foreign language, usually [[English language]].
In the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], after the sixth grade, the student has to choose among [[Technology]], [[Home economics]], and a second foreign language, usually [[French language]].
Other subjects are [[Geography]], [[Social sciences]], [[Economics]], [[History]], religious education, and physical education.
After the 8th grade a student has to choose between [[Arts]] and [[Music]].
High school diplomas obtained in [[Canada]] or the [[United States]] are usually acknowledged as a [[Mittlere Reife]] (graduation from a Realschule).[1] In some cases however students may apply for certain subjects at a university.
All students holding an American high school diploma may apply for the [[Studienkolleg]], and after successfully graduating from this they may attend a German university.[2] Those holding a high school diploma can choose from a wider range of possible major subjects at a German university if they did well on the [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)]].
[[Gymnasia and Realgymnasia]] are the classical higher or secondary schools of [[Germany]].
Starting in 2010/2011, Realschulen were formally abolished in [[Berlin]] and merged with [[Hauptschule]] and the old [[Gesamtschule]] to form a new type of comprehensive school, called Stadtteilschule in Hamburg and Sekundarschule in Berlin.[citation needed]
Only the Gymnasium is a [[University-preparatory school]], so critics argue that a decision is made as early as the fourth grade about whether a child will be allowed to attend college.[citation needed]
The system is considered so onerous outside Germany that the [[OECD]] even sent a special envoy[citation needed] to Germany to condemn current German practice.[citation needed] Specifically, the Brazilian expert found that German schools separate children according to [[Social class]], with children of academics and professionals more often being sent on to a Gymnasium, and working-class children being sent to a Realschule or a Hauptschule.
They point to the fact that not only Gymnasium, but also comprehensive schools and schools serving mature students such as the [[Kolleg]] or the [[Berufsoberschule]] offer the possibility for the Abitur.
The "Erweiterte Realschule" (expanded Realschule) is a school that exists in the German State of the [[Saarland]].
While the Realschule is a [[Selective school]], the Erweiterte Realschule is a school that does not select its students on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude.
The "Realschule Plus" is a non-selective school that exists in the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].
Systematically they were founded by Habsburg Monarchy after 1804: e.g. 1811 in [[Brno]] (German-language), 1815 in [[Brody]] ([[Galicia (Eastern Europe)]]), 1817 in [[Lviv]] and [[Trieste]] etc.
In the [[Czech lands]], in the school year 1917/1918 there existed 43 Czech-language reálka, namely 30 in Bohemia and 13 in Moravia.
The realskole existed in [[Norway]] between 1935 and 1970.
It replaced the former middelskole, and was the level between folkeskole (primary school) and [[Gymnasium (school)]].
