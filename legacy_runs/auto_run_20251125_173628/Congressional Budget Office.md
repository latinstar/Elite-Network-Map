The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a [[List of United States federal agencies]] within the [[United States Congress]] of the [[United States government]] that provides budget and economic information to Congress.[1]
Inspired by California's [[California Legislative Analyst's Office]] that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]].[2]
The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] (Pub.
93-344), which was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on July 12, 1974.[6] Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with [[Alice Rivlin]] as director.[7]
The CBO's creation stems from a fight between President Nixon and a [[Democratic Party (United States)]]-controlled [[United States Congress]].
Congress wanted to protect its [[Power of the purse]] from the executive.[4][8] The CBO was created "within the legislative branch to bolster Congress's budgetary understanding and ability to act.
Lawmakers' aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature's reliance on the president's [[Office of Management and Budget]]."[4] In 2015, the Brookings Institution reported that since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB "as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public."[7]
The Congressional Budget Office is [[Nonpartisanism]], and produces "independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process."[9] Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.
With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating revenue for Congress, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] for estimating revenues for the [[Executive (government)]].
This includes projections on the effect on [[National debt]] and cost estimates for legislation.[10]
Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the [[United States House Committee on the Budget]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget]] budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget.
The agency also each year issues An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the [[Senate Committee on Appropriations]].
These three series are designated essential titles distributed to [[Federal depository library]] and are available for purchase from the [[United States Government Publishing Office]].
The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees.
A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that "adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."[5] According to MIT economist [[David Autor]], the "CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment.
It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent."[5] According to Yale economist [[Christopher Udry]], "There is no credible evidence of partisan bias."[5] Economist [[Walter E.
Williams]], a [[Classical liberal]], wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its "honest numbers" on fiscal and economic matters.[7] According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], "the CBO's analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work...
Historically, the [[House Budget Committee]] and [[Senate Budget Committee]] have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office.[7] Professor Philip Joyce of the [[University of Maryland School of Public Policy]] writes:
