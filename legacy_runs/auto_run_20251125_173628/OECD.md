[[Normative economics]] and policy
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; [[French language]]: Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques, OCDE) is an [[International organization]] with 38 member countries,[1][4] founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and [[International trade]].
It is a [[Forum (legal)]] whose member countries describe themselves as committed to [[Democracy]] and the [[Market economy]], providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practices, and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members.
The majority of OECD members are generally regarded as [[Developed country]], with [[World Bank high-income economy]], and a very high [[Human Development Index]].
As of 2024[update] their collective population is 1.38 billion[5] people with an average life expectancy of 80 years and a [[Median age]] of 40, against a global average of 30.[6] As of 2017[update], OECD Member countries collectively comprised 62.2% of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]] ([[United States dollar]] 49.6 trillion)[7] and 42.8% of global [[Gross domestic product]] ([[International dollar]]54.2 trillion) at [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)]].[8] The OECD is an official [[United Nations General Assembly observers]].[9] OECD nations have strong [[Welfare spending]]; their average [[Welfare state]] stood at roughly 21% of GDP.[10][11][12]
The OECD's headquarters are at the [[Château de la Muette]] in [[Paris]], France, which housed its predecessor organisation, the Organization for European Economic Co-operation.[13] The OECD is funded by contributions from member countries at varying rates and is recognised as a highly influential publisher of mostly economic data through publications as well as annual evaluations and rankings of member countries.[14]
The OECD is the successor organisation to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC),[15] [[Committee of European Economic Co-operation]] among the European recipients of [[Marshall Plan]] aid for the reconstruction of Europe after [[World War II]].[16][17][18] Only Western European states were members of the OEEC, whose primary function was the allocation of American aid.
Its Secretaries-General[19] were the Frenchmen [[Robert Marjolin]] (1948–1955) and René Sergent (1955–1960).
It was headquartered in the [[Château de la Muette]] in Paris.
Following the end of Marshall aid in 1952, the OEEC focused on economic issues.[15]  Its coordinating role was challenged after the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing the  [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom Treaty]].
The OEEC provided a framework for negotiations aimed at setting up a [[European Free Trade Area]], to bring the EEC's [[Inner Six]] and other OEEC members together on a multilateral basis.
In 1958, a [[European Nuclear Energy Agency]] was set up in response to Euratom.
Following several (occasionally unruly) meetings at the [[Hotel Majestic (Paris)]] in Paris, which began in January 1960, a resolution was reached to create a body that would not only solve European and Atlantic economic issues, but also devise policies that could assist less developed countries.
This reconstituted organisation would bring the US and Canada, who were already OEEC observers, on board as full members, and the OEEC would set to work straight away on convincing [[Japan]] to join the organisation.[20][21][22]
The [[Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] was signed on 14 December 1960, and the OECD officially superseded the OEEC in September 1961, consisting of the European founder countries of the OEEC, with the additions of the United States and Canada.
Japan became a member in 1964, and over the following decade, [[Finland]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] also joined the organisation.
[[SFR Yugoslavia]] had observer status in the organisation, starting with the establishment of the OECD, until its [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]].[23] The OECD also created agencies such as the [[OECD Development Centre]] (1961), [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA, 1974), and [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]].
Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the OECD began assisting countries in Central Europe (especially the [[Visegrád Group]]) to prepare market economy reforms.
In 1990, the Centre for Co-operation with European Economies in Transition (now succeeded by the Centre for Cooperation with Non-Members) was established, and in 1991, the programme, "Partners in Transition", was launched to offer a partnership to [[Czechoslovakia]], Hungary and Poland,[25] including a membership option for these countries.[25] As a result of this, [[Poland]],[26] [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], as well as [[South Korea]][27] and [[Mexico]], became members of the OECD between 1996 and 2000.
[[East Germany]] joined on 3 October 1990 through [[German reunification]] with West Germany.
In 1995, [[Cyprus]] applied for membership, but according to the Cypriot government, it was vetoed by [[Turkey]].[28] In 1996, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] signed a Joint Declaration expressing willingness to become members of the OECD,[29] and [[Slovenia]] also applied for membership that same year.[30] In 2005, [[Malta]] applied to join the Organisation.[31] The EU is lobbying for the admission of all [[EU member states]].[32] [[Romania]] reaffirmed in 2012 its intention to become a member of the Organisation through the letter addressed by Romanian Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] to OECD Secretary-General [[José Ángel Gurría]].[33] In September 2012, the government of [[Bulgaria]] confirmed it would apply for membership before the OECD Secretariat.[34]
The working group defined four criteria that must be fulfilled: "like-mindedness", "significant player", "mutual benefit" and "global considerations." The working group's recommendations were presented at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting on 13 May 2004, and on 16 May 2007, the OECD Ministerial Council decided to open accession discussions with [[Chile]], [[Estonia]], [[Israel]], [[Russia]], and [[Slovenia]], and to strengthen cooperation with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], and [[South Africa]] through a process of enhanced engagement.[35] Chile, Slovenia, Israel, and Estonia all became members in 2010.[36] In March 2014, the OECD halted membership talks with Russia in response to its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]].[37][38]
In 2013, the OECD decided to open membership talks with [[Colombia]] and [[Latvia]].
In 2015, the Organisation opened talks with [[Costa Rica]] and [[Lithuania]].[39] Latvia became a member on 1 July 2016, and Lithuania soon followed on 5 July 2018.[40][41] Colombia signed the accession agreement on 30 May 2018 and became a member on 28 April 2020.[42] On 15 May 2020, the OECD decided to extend a formal invitation for Costa Rica to join the OECD,[43] which joined as a member on 25 May 2021.[2]
Other countries that have expressed interest in OECD membership are [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]],[44] [[Croatia]],[45] [[Malaysia]][46] and [[Peru]].[47]

In June 2022, during the annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, the Roadmaps for the Accession to the OECD Convention for [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Peru]] and [[Romania]] were adopted.[50] In March 2024, the Roadmaps for the Accession to the OECD were adopted with [[Argentina]][51] and [[Indonesia]],[52] and in July 2024, also with [[Thailand]].[53]
The OECD sets the rules governing [[International taxation]] for multinationals through the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, a Model Tax Convention and country-by-country reporting rules.
The new system was promoted by the [[Presidency of Joe Biden]] and the OECD.
Secretary-General [[Mathias Cormann]] of the OECD said, "This historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere."[54]
The [[OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]] are a set of legally non-binding guidelines attached as an annex to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises.
They are recommendations providing principles and standards for responsible business conduct for [[Multinational corporations]] operating in or from countries adhering to the Declaration.[55]
All titles and databases published since 1998 can be accessed via [[OECD iLibrary]].
The OECD Library & Archives collection dates from 1947, including records from the [[Committee of European Economic Co-operation]] (CEEC) and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), predecessors of today's OECD.
[[OECD Observer]], an award-winning magazine,[n 1] was launched in 1962.[59] The magazine appeared six times a year until 2010, and became quarterly in 2011 with the introduction of the OECD Yearbook, launched for the 50th anniversary of the organisation.[60] The online and mobile[61] editions contained news, analysis, reviews, commentaries and data on global economic, social and environmental challenges and listings of the latest OECD books.[62] An OECD Observer Crossword was introduced in Q2 2013.[63] The OECD Observer was last issued in the fourth quarter of 2019, with a double edition looking ahead at artificial intelligence, and a cover leading on why statistical offices should hire a comedian.
The OECD is known as a [[List of national and international statistical services]], as it publishes comparable statistics on numerous subjects.
In July 2014, the OECD publicly released its main [[Statistical database]] through the OECD Data Portal, an online platform that allows visitors to create custom charts based on official OECD indicators.[68][69]
In July 2024, the OECD announced that it "has transitioned to [an] open-access information model" and that Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license]] will be used on all data and publications.

It published the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030 in March 2008, which argues that tackling key environmental problems—including [[Climate change]], [[Biodiversity loss]], [[Water scarcity]], and the health impacts of [[Pollution]]—is both achievable and affordable.[72]
In 2020, the inaugural University Press Redux Sustainability Award was given to OECD by the [[Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers]] (ALPSP) and [[Cambridge University Press]].[73] The award recognised the development of the SDG Pathfinder, an open-access digital discovery tool for finding content and data relating to the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs).[74][75]
Former [[Secretary General]] Pierre Vinde [sv] estimated in 1997 that the cost borne by the member countries, such as sending their officials to OECD meetings and maintaining permanent delegations, is equivalent to the cost of running the secretariat.[77]
Secretary-General selections are made by [[Consensus decision-making]], meaning all member states must agree on a candidate.[81]
[[Dependent territories]] of member states are not members in their own right, but may have membership as part of their [[Sovereign state]].[116] As of January 2021, the [[Dutch Caribbean]] and the British territories of [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]], and [[Bermuda]] are included as part of the OECD memberships of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]], respectively.[117][118] Other dependent territories of OECD member states are not members of the OECD.
The [[European Commission]] participates in the work of the OECD alongside the EU member states.[119] The OECD designates [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], and [[South Africa]] as Key Partners, which participate in policy discussions in OECD bodies, and take part in regular OECD surveys.[120][121]
