George Walker Bush[a] (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician, businessman, and former [[U.S. Air Force]] officer who was the 43rd [[President of the United States]] from 2001 to 2009.
A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]] and the eldest son of the 41st president, [[George H.
Bush]], he served as the 46th [[Governor of Texas]] from 1995 to 2000.
Born into the prominent [[Bush family]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Bush flew warplanes in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] in his twenties.
After graduating from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1975, he worked in the oil industry.
He later co-owned the [[Major League Baseball]] team [[Texas Rangers (baseball)]] before being elected governor of Texas [[1994 Texas gubernatorial election]].
He also helped make Texas the [[Wind power in Texas]] in the United States.
In the [[2000 United States presidential election]], he won over Democratic incumbent vice president [[Al Gore]] while [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote]] after a narrow and contested [[United States Electoral College]] win, which involved [[Bush v.
Gore]] to stop [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida]].
In his first term, Bush signed [[Bush tax cuts]] and an education-reform bill, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].
He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] and [[Faith-based initiatives]].
He also initiated the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]], in 2003, to address [[AIDS in the United States]].
The [[September 11 attacks]] decisively reshaped his administration, resulting in the start of the [[War on terror]] and the creation of the [[Department of Homeland Security]].
Bush ordered the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]] in an effort to overthrow the [[Taliban]], destroy [[Al-Qaeda]], and capture [[Osama bin Laden]].
He signed the [[Patriot Act]] to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists.
He also ordered the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to overthrow [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime on the false belief that it [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) and had [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations]].
Bush later signed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], which created [[Medicare Part D]].
In 2004, Bush [[2004 United States presidential election]] in a close race, beating Democratic opponent [[John Kerry]] and winning the popular vote.
During his second term, Bush made various [[Free trade agreement]], appointed [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] to the Supreme Court, and sought major changes to [[Social Security (United States)]] and immigration laws, but both efforts failed in Congress.
Bush was widely criticized for [[Criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina]] and revelations of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.
Amid his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the [[2006 United States elections]].
Meanwhile, the Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued; in January 2007, Bush launched [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]].
By December, the U.S. entered the [[Great Recession]], prompting the Bush administration and Congress to push through economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system, including the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]].
He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, and one of the lowest ratings during the [[2008 financial crisis]].
[[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] Bush as a below-average to the lower half of presidents.
George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at [[Grace-New Haven Hospital]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].[1] He was the first child of [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] and [[Barbara Pierce]].
He was raised in [[Midland, Texas]] and [[Houston]], Texas, with four siblings: [[Jeb Bush]], [[Neil Bush]], [[Marvin Bush]] and [[Dorothy Bush Koch]].
Another younger sister, [[Pauline Robinson Bush]], died from [[Leukemia]] at the age of three in 1953.[2] His paternal grandfather, [[Prescott Bush]], was a U.S. senator from [[Connecticut]].[3] His father was [[Ronald Reagan]]'s vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993.
Bush has [[English Americans]] and [[German Americans]] ancestry, along with more distant [[Dutch Americans]], [[Welsh Americans]], [[Irish Americans]], [[French Americans]], and [[Scottish Americans]] roots.[4][improper synthesis?]
He then spent two years at [[The Kinkaid School]], a [[College-preparatory school]] in [[Piney Point Village, Texas]].[5]
Bush later attended [[Phillips Academy]], a boarding school in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year.[6][7] He attended [[Yale University]] from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history.[8] During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[9][10][11] Bush became [[List of Skull and Bones members]] of the [[Skull and Bones]] society as a senior.[12] Bush was a [[Rugby union]] player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[13] He characterized himself as an average student.[14] His [[Grade point average]] during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumerical rating system in his final year.[15]
In the fall of 1973, Bush entered [[Harvard Business School]].
He graduated in 1975 with a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, and is the only U.S. president to have earned the degree.[16]
Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.[17] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to [[Laura Welch]], a schoolteacher and librarian.
After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year.[18] The couple settled in [[Midland, Texas]].
Bush left his family's [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] to join his wife's [[United Methodist Church]].[19] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to [[Fraternal twin]] daughters, [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)]] and [[Jenna Bush Hager]].[18] Bush describes being challenged by [[Billy Graham]] to consider faith in Jesus "Christ as the risen Lord", how he began to read the [[Bible]] daily, "surrendering" to the "Almighty", that "faith is a walk" and that he was "moved by [[God]]'s love".[20]
Before his marriage, Bush repeatedly [[Alcohol abuse]].[21] On September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his [[Walker's Point Estate]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]], for [[Driving under the influence of alcohol]].
He was arrested for [[Driving under the influence]], was fined $150, and received a brief suspension of his Maine driver's license.[22] Bush said that his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[18] and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986 to her influence.[23] While governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time."[18] Bush also says that his faith in God was critical in abstaining: "I believe that God helped open my eyes, which were closing because of booze".[20]
Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[24] During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily,[25] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is "not a literalist" about Bible interpretation.[26][27] [[Walt Harrington]], a journalist, recalled seeing "books by [[John Fowles]], [[F.
Scott Fitzgerald]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Gore Vidal]] lying about, as well as biographies of [[Willa Cather]] and [[Queen Victoria]]" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman.
In May 1968, Bush joined the [[United States Air Force]] and was commissioned into the [[Texas Air National Guard]].[31] After two years of training in active-duty service,[32] he was assigned to [[Houston]], flying [[Convair F-102]] with the [[147th Reconnaissance Wing]] out of [[Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base]].[31][33] Critics, including former [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Terry McAuliffe]], have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of [[United States House of Representatives]], citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[31] In June 2005, [[United States Department of Defense]] released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[34]
In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the [[187th Fighter Wing]] of the [[Alabama Air National Guard]].
He had moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican [[Winton M.
Blount]].[35][36] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[37] He was honorably discharged from the [[Air Force Reserve]] on November 21, 1974.[38]
In 1977, Bush established [[Arbusto Energy]], a small [[Oil exploration]] company, which began operations in 1978.[40][41] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration.
In 1984, his company merged with the larger [[Spectrum 7]], and Bush became chairman.
The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into [[Harken Energy Corporation]],[42] with Bush becoming a member of Harken's board of directors.
Bush insider trading allegations]] involving Harken arose, but a [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[43]
In April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest of Major League Baseball's [[Texas Rangers (baseball)]] for $89 million and invested $500,000 himself to start.
In the early or mid 1990s, before his gubernatorial campaign, Bush briefly considered a candidacy to become the [[Commissioner of Baseball]].[47][48][49]
[[1978 United States House of Representatives elections]], Bush ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Texas's 19th congressional district]].
Bush's opponent, [[Kent Hance]], portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election, receiving 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[50]
Bush 1988 presidential campaign]].[51][52] He was a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[53] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential [[George H.
Bush 1992 presidential campaign]] as a campaign advisor.[54] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff [[John H.
Bush declared his candidacy for the [[1994 Texas gubernatorial election]] at the same time his brother Jeb [[1994 Florida gubernatorial election]].
His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, [[Tort reform]], crime reduction, and education improvement.[53] Bush's campaign advisers were [[Karen Hughes]], [[Joe Allbaugh]], and [[Karl Rove]].[56]
After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent governor [[Ann Richards]].[53][57] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain [[Concealed carry permit]].
Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor.[58] According to [[The Atlantic]], the race "featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed [[LGBT social movements]]' to state jobs".[59] The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[60] but Rove denied being involved.[61] Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent of the vote against Richards' 45.9 percent.[62]
Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest [[Tax cut]], $2 billion.[56] He extended government funding for organizations providing education on the dangers of alcohol and [[Substance abuse]], and helping to reduce [[Domestic violence]].[63] His administration lowered the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14.[64] Bush presided over 152 executions,[65] more than any previous governor in modern American history; critics such as [[Helen Prejean]] argue that he failed to give serious consideration to [[Clemency]] requests.[66][67] Critics also contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations.
In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a [[Renewable portfolio standard]] (RPS),[68][69][70] which helped [[Wind power in Texas]] eventually become the [[Wind power in the United States]] of [[Wind power]] electricity in the U.S.[71][72]
[[1998 Texas gubernatorial election]], Bush won re-election with a record[53] 68 percent of the vote.[73] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[53] During his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high [[Approval rating]], which ranged between 62 and 81 percent.[53][74] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be [[Jesus Day]] in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to "answer the call to serve those in need".[75]
Bush portrayed himself as a [[Compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans.
He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and Arizona senator [[John McCain]].[53]
Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]] and, although heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], trailed McCain by 19% and lost.
Despite this, he regained momentum and effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000]], which according to [[The Boston Globe]] made history for his campaign's negativity.
[[The New York Times]] described it as a [[Smear campaign]].[76][77][78]
On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected [[Dick Cheney]] – a former [[White House chief of staff]], U.S. representative, and secretary of defense – to be his running mate.
Soon after at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.[79]
Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[53] During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent vice president [[Al Gore]], over [[Gun law in the United States]] and taxation.[80]
The closeness of the Florida outcome led to [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000]].[53] The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].[81] On December 9, in the controversial [[Bush v.
Gore]] ruling,[82] the Court reversed a [[Florida Supreme Court]] decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].[53] The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million casts.[83] Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 [[Electoral College (United States)]] to Gore's 266 (Gore had actually been awarded 267 votes by the states pledged to him plus the District of Columbia, but one D.C. elector abstained).
Bush was the first person to [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote]] than another candidate since [[Benjamin Harrison]] in 1888.[83]
He appointed [[Ken Mehlman]] as campaign manager, and [[Karl Rove]] devised a political strategy.[84] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[85] support for the [[USA PATRIOT Act]],[86] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and [[Same-sex marriage]],[85][87] reforming [[Social Security (United States)]] to create private investment accounts,[85] creation of an [[Ownership society]],[85] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[88] Bush also called for the implementation of a [[Guest worker program]] for immigrants,[85] which was criticized by conservatives.[89]
The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts senator [[John Kerry]].
Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth.
The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[Liberalism in the United States]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government.
Following the resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]] in 2004, Bush nominated [[Porter Goss]] to head the agency.
Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the [[September 11 attacks]].[93] Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees.
Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[94] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[95] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-[[World War II]] recession.[96]
Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the [[Dot-com bubble]].[97] The September 11 terrorist attacks also [[Economic effects of the September 11 attacks]].
His administration increased federal [[Government spending]] from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (66%), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008).
Johnson]].[99] The number of [[Economic regulation]] governmental workers increased by 91,196.[100]
The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion – the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[101] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.[102] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held town hall-style meetings across the U.S. to increase public support for his plan for [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]], one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[53] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying "the surplus is not the government's money.
The surplus is the people's money."[53] Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[103] Treasury Secretary [[Paul H.
O'Neill]], opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine [[Social Security (United States)]].[104] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[105] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[53] [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]] was passed that year.[106]
Between 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125%,[107] less than for past business cycles.[108] Bush entered office with the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000.
Unemployment originally rose from 4.2% in January 2001 to 6.3% in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5% in July 2007.[111] Adjusted for inflation, [[Median household income]] dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[112] while Professor Ken Homa of [[Georgetown University]] noted that "Median real after-tax household income went up two percent".[113] The poverty rate increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 12.3% in 2006 after peaking at 12.7% in 2004.[114] By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[115]: 273  the [[National debt of the United States]] had risen to $11.3 trillion,[116] more than doubling it since 2000.[117][118][unreliable source?] Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the "[[Bush tax cuts]]" and increased national security spending.[119] In March 2006, then-senator [[Barack Obama]] said when he voted against raising the [[United States debt ceiling]]: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."[120] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2%.[121]
In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–[[World War II]] recession,[96] [[Causes of the Great Recession]] by a [[United States housing market correction]], a [[Subprime mortgage crisis]], [[2000s energy crisis]], and other factors.
In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,[122] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[123] The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.[124] By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost 2.6 million jobs.[125]
To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses.[126] The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] in 2003,[127] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate.
Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[128][129][130] In September 2008, the [[2008 financial crisis]] intensified, beginning with the [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]] followed by the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] and a federal bailout of [[American International Group]] for $85 billion.[131]
Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the [[Great Depression]].[132][133] Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]].[134] Bush, meanwhile, proposed [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[135] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], said "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the [[FDIC]] to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped "for Congress to have held hearings".[129]
Bush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students.
One of the administration's early major initiatives was the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools.
This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts.[137] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[138] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.[139] Critics[who?] argue that it is underfunded[140][better source needed] and that NCLBA's focus on "high-stakes testing" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[141]
On November 1, 2005, Bush launched a National Strategy for [[Flu pandemic]], which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in May 2006.[142][143]
After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[Welfare state]] in forty years" – the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.[115]: 274  In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress.
It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[144] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward [[Socialized health care]], and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[145]
On May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]], aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information.
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[148] The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement.
Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to [[Social Security debate in the United States]] Social Security,[150] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005.
Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[150] In his [[2005 State of the Union Address]], Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ([[FICA]]) into secured investments.[150] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[150]
Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security" in an attempt to gain public support.[151] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined,[152] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[153] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to [[Hurricane Katrina]].[154]
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing [[Greenhouse gas emissions]], citing that the treaty exempted 80% of the world's population[155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.
In May 2001, Bush signed an [[Executive order]] to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,[157] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[158]
In 2002, Bush proposed the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],[159] which aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[Emissions trading]] programs.
Later in 2006, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[Marine reserve]] to date.
The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[161] The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".[162]
Bush has said he believes that [[Global warming]] is real[163] and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused".[164] The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities.
Critics have alleged that the administration[165] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities]] and deter global warming.[166]
In his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], Bush declared, "America is addicted to oil" and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase [[Energy development]] research.[167]
In his [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing [[Fossil fuel]] consumption and increasing [[Alternative fuel]] production.[168] Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on [[Offshore drilling]].[169] However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling.
My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[Fuel cell]] ...
In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush committed $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also presented plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."[171]
Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] has been forbidden by law since the passage of the [[Dickey–Wicker Amendment]] in 1995.[172] Bush has said he supports adult [[Stem cell]] research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research.
However, Bush did not support [[Embryonic stem cell]] research.[173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing "lines" of stem cells,[174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned.
Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]].
Nearly eight million immigrants came to the U.S. from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.[177] Almost half entered illegally.[178][unreliable source?] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million [[Illegal immigrants]] to work in the United States with the creation of a "temporary guest-worker program".
Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 [[National Guard of the United States]] troops to the [[Mexico–United States border]].[179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]], which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and worksite enforcement measures; a reform of the [[Green card]] application process and the introduction of a point-based "merit" system for green cards; elimination of "[[Chain migration]]" and of the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]]; and other measures.
A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[183] The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a [[Cloture]] motion failed on a 46–53 vote.[184] Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[185] The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[186]
On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[187]
[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history.
Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 [[Atlantic]] hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], particularly New Orleans.[188]
Bush declared a state of emergency in [[Louisiana]] on August 27[189] and in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] the following day.[190] The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to [[Levee]] breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana,[191] officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.
On August 30, DHS Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] declared it "an incident of national significance",[192] triggering the first use of the newly created [[National Response Plan]].
As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, Bush received [[Criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina]] for downplaying his administration's role in the inadequate response.
Brown]];[195] federal resources to respond were also limited as a result of being allocated to the [[Iraq War]],[196] and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.[197][198] Bush responded to mounting criticism by claiming to accept full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.[193] It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[199]
During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the [[United States Department of Justice]] midterm dismissal of seven [[United States Attorney]].[200] The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance.[201] Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[202][203] The [[House Judiciary Committee]] issued subpoenas for advisers [[Harriet Miers]] and [[Josh Bolten]] to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of [[Executive privilege]].
On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.[205] On July 31, 2008, a [[United States district court]] judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas.[206]
They included Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]][207] and his chief of staff [[Kyle Sampson]],[208] Gonzales' liaison to the White House [[Monica Goodling]],[209] aide to the president [[Karl Rove]][210] and his senior aide [[Sara Taylor]].[211] In addition, legal counsel to the president [[Harriet Miers]][212] and deputy chief of staff to the president [[Joshua Bolten]][213] were both found in [[Contempt of Congress]].[211]
During his presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States]] platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in "[[Nation-building]]" and other small-scale military engagements.
The administration pursued a [[National missile defense]].[216] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].[217]
He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign.
In March 2006, Bush visited India in a trip focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power]], counter-terrorism co-operation, and discussions that would eventually lead to the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].[219][220] This was in stark contrast to decades of U.S. policy, such as the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as "sanctions and hectoring".[221]
Bush signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] with Russia.
He withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including, in 2002, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) with Russia.[223] This marked the first time in post-World War II history that the United States had withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.[224] Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] stated that American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was a mistake.[225]
Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and Palestinian National Authority president [[Mahmoud Abbas]].
Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with China over the [[Hainan Island incident]], when an [[EP-3E Aries II]] surveillance aircraft collided with a [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel.
Bush condemned the [[War in Darfur]] and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[226] Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but he opposed referring the situation to the [[International Criminal Court]].
On June 10, 2007, Bush met with [[Albanian Prime Minister]] [[Sali Berisha]] and became the first president to visit Albania.[227] He later voiced his support for the [[Independence of Kosovo]].[228]
In early 2008, Bush vowed full support for admitting [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)]] into [[NATO]][229] despite Russia's opposition to the further [[Enlargement of NATO]].[230] During the [[2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis]], Bush condemned Russia for recognizing the separatist government of [[South Ossetia]].[231] When Russian troops invaded Georgia later that summer, Bush said: "Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century."[232]
That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks.
Three days after the attacks, Bush visited [[World Trade Center site]] and met with then-New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], firefighters, police officers, and volunteers.
In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned [[Osama bin Laden]] and his organization [[Al-Qaeda]], and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ...
share in their fate".[234] The Taliban's leader, [[Mullah Omar]], refused to hand over bin Laden.[235]
The continued presence of U.S. troops in [[Saudi Arabia]] after the 1991 [[Gulf War]] was one of the stated motivations behind the September 11 attacks.
In 2003, [[Operation Southern Watch]] most of its troops from Saudi Arabia.[236]
In Bush's September 20 speech, he declared that "our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there."[237][238] In his January 29, [[2002 State of the Union Address]], he asserted that an "[[Axis of evil]]" consisting of [[North Korea]], [[Iran]], and [[Ba'athist Iraq]] was "arming to threaten the peace of the world" and "pose[d] a grave and growing danger".[239] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage [[Preemptive war]], or [[Preventive war]].[240] This became the basis for the [[Bush Doctrine]] which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.[241]
Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[242][243][244] The Iraq war sparked many protests and riots in different parts of the world.[245] In 2006, a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] concluded that the Iraq War had become the "[[Cause célèbre]] for [[Jihad]]".[246][247]
On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13.
The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[Al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders.
In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[248] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[248] Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].[249][250]
Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped [[Battle of Tora Bora]] in the mountainous region of [[Tora Bora]], which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[251] It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration.
Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[252] The 2005 failure of [[Operation Red Wings]] showed that the Taliban had returned.[253] In 2006, the [[Taliban insurgency]] appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] attaining limited success.[254][255][256] As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.[257]
Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[Axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[Weapons of mass destruction]].[239][258]
In the latter half of 2002, CIA [[National Intelligence Estimate]] contained assertions of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi [[Biological warfare]] and [[Chemical warfare]], and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.[259][260] Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.[261][262]
In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi [[Disarmament]] mandates, precipitating a [[Iraq disarmament crisis]].
In November 2002, [[Hans Blix]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.[263] The U.S. initially sought a [[UN Security Council]] resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[264] The Bush administration's claim that the Iraq War was part of the war on terror had been [[Criticism of the war on terror]] by political analysts.[265]
More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom) designated the "[[Multi-National Force – Iraq]]" joined the United States[266] in invading Iraq.
The capital, [[Baghdad]], fell on April 9, 2003.
The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's "[[Mission Accomplished]]" speech was later criticized as premature.[267] From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)]].[268] Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq.
The 2006 report of the bipartisan [[Iraq Study Group]], led by [[James Baker]], concluded that the situation in Iraq was "grave and deteriorating".
While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regard to the stability of Iraq,[269] he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.[270][271] According to [[Iraq Body Count]], some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.[272]
In January 2005, elections recognized by the West as free and fair were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[273] This led to the election of [[Jalal Talabani]] as president and [[Nouri al-Maliki]] as Prime Minister of Iraq.
A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most [[Shiite]] and many [[Kurds]].[274]
On January 10, 2007, Bush launched a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]], as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion (equivalent to $1.8 billion in 2024) for these programs.[275] On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[276] saying the debate over the conflict was "understandable" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[277]
In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's "bold decision" to launch the [[Battle of Basra (2008)]] against the [[Mahdi Army]], calling it "a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq".[278] He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General [[David Petraeus]] and Ambassador [[Ryan Crocker]] about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008.
He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the [[2009 Iraqi governorate elections]].[279] By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,[280] and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush withdrew of additional American forces.[280] During Bush's last visit to Iraq in December 2008, Iraqi journalist [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]] [[Bush shoeing incident]] during an official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]].[281] Al-Zaidi yelled that the shoes were a "farewell kiss" and "for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq".[282]
In March 2010, [[Center for Public Integrity]] released a report that President Bush's administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about the alleged threat of Iraq against the United States, as his rationale to engage in war in Iraq.[283]
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the [[President's Surveillance Program]].
The new directive allowed the [[National Security Agency]] to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].[284] As of 2009[update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.[285] Once the [[United States Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]] questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].[286] The program proved to be [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)]]; critics of the administration and organizations such as the [[American Bar Association]] argued that it was illegal.[287] In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]] was unconstitutional,[288] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was [[Vacated]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked [[Standing (law)]].[289] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.[290] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as [[PRISM]], which was subject to the oversight of the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]].[291] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by [[The Washington Post]][291] and [[The Guardian]][292] emerged in June 2013.[291]
Bush authorized the [[CIA]] to use [[Waterboarding]] and several other "[[Enhanced interrogation techniques]]" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture.[293][294][295][296] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]]' ban on torture, which was described as "an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war".[297][298] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the [[Bybee Memo]] from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn.[299] While not permitted by the [[U.S. Army Field Manuals]] which assert "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information",[297] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations "provided critical information" to preserve American lives.[300] Critics, such as former CIA officer [[Bob Baer]], have stated that information was suspect, "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough."[301]
On October 17, 2006, Bush signed the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] into law.[302] The new rule was enacted in the wake of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision in [[Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld]], [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 548]] [[United States Reports]] 557 (2006),[303] which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute [[Unlawful enemy combatants]] by military commission rather than a standard trial.
The law also denied the detainees access to [[Habeas corpus]] and barred the torture of prisoners.
On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[304] a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]], saying that "the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror".[305] In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[306] One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[307]
Bush publicly condemned [[Kim Jong-il]] of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an "[[Axis of evil]]".
He said that "the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."[239] Within months, "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK [[Agreed Framework]] of October 1994."[308] North Korea's October 9, 2006, [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]] of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on "[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world".[239] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and said that "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[309] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account.
Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.[314] In 2003, Bush signed the [[Syria Accountability Act]], which expanded sanctions on Syria.
In early 2007, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], acting on a June 2005 [[Executive order]], froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory.
Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread [[Weapons of mass destruction]][315] and being supportive of terrorism.[316] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to "undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon" in November 2007.
Those designated included: [[Assaad Hardan]], a member of Lebanon's parliament and former leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; [[Wiam Wahhab]], a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister [[Omar Karami]] (2004–2005); [[Hafez Makhlouf]], a colonel and senior official in the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Syria)]] and a cousin of Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]]; and [[Mohammed Nasif Kheirbek]], identified as a close adviser to Assad.[317]
In the [[2003 State of the Union Address]], Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR).
Bush announced $15 billion for this effort,[318] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.[319] The U.S. government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], a multilateral organization),[320] which saved an estimated five million lives by 2013.[321] The New York Times correspondent [[Peter Baker (author)]] wrote in 2013 that "Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since."[321] By 2023, PEPFAR was estimated to have saved over 25 million lives, alleviating the severity of the [[AIDS epidemic]] especially in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and was called "George W.
Bush's greatest accomplishment" by [[Vox (website)]].[322][323][324]
Pickett was shot in the knee by a [[U.S. Secret Service]] agent and arrested.
Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an [[Alford plea]] to assaulting a federal officer.
He was sentenced to three years at the [[Federal Medical Center, Rochester]] followed by three years of probation.[325][326][327][328]
On May 10, 2005, while President Bush was giving a speech in [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi]], [[Vladimir Arutyunian]], a native [[Georgians]] who was born to a family of ethnic [[Armenians]], threw a live Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade toward the podium.
It landed in the crowd about 61 feet (19 m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate because a red tartan handkerchief was wrapped tightly around it, preventing the safety lever from detaching.[329][330] Georgian president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] was seated nearby.
He was convicted in January 2006 and given a [[Life sentence]].[331][332]
On December 14, 2008, [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]], an Iraqi journalist, threw both of his shoes at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad.
Bush was not injured, having ducked the pair of shoes.[333] However, White House press secretary [[Dana Perino]] received a bruise on her face after being hit by a microphone boom knocked over by security.[334] Al-Zaidi received a three-year prison sentence which was reduced to one year.
On July 19, 2005, following the retirement of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[John Roberts]] as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating Roberts to be the next [[Chief Justice of the United States]].
On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated [[White House Counsel]] [[Harriet Miers]] to succeed O'Connor; however, Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27 after encountering significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law.[115]: 278  Finally, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]], who was confirmed by the Senate to replace O'Connor on January 31, 2006.[336]
In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 62 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]].[citation needed]
Bush's upbringing in [[West Texas]], his accent, his [[United States Presidential vacations]] to his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.[337][338] "I think people look at him and think [[John Wayne]]", said [[Piers Morgan]], editor of the British [[Daily Mirror]].[339]
Bush has been [[Parodied]] by the media,[340] comedians, and other politicians.[341] Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as [[Bushism]].[342]
[[Tony Blair]] wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is "ludicrous" and that Bush is "very smart".[344] In an interview with [[Playboy]], The New York Times columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)]] said Bush "was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public.
Bush began his presidency with [[United States presidential approval rating]] near 60 percent.[346] After the [[September 11 attacks]], Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent,[347] maintaining 80–90 percent approval for four months after the attacks.
In 2000 and again in 2004, [[Time (magazine)]] magazine named George W.
Bush as its [[Time Person of the Year]], a title awarded to someone who the editors believe "has done the most to influence the events of the year".[350] In May 2004, [[Gallup (company)]] reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[351] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.[352]
Within the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.[353] While 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival, [[John Kerry]].[353] According to [[Peter Feaver]], a [[Duke University]] political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[353]
Bush's approval rating surged to 74 percent at the beginning of the [[Iraq War]], up 19 points from his pre-war rating of 55 percent.[354] Bush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in [[Associated Press]]-[[Ipsos]] polling in December 2004.[355] Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped.
After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[356][357][358] for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], his [[Political effects of Hurricane Katrina]],[359][360][361] and to the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], [[NSA warrantless surveillance]], the [[Plame affair]], and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] controversies.[362]
Amid this criticism, the [[Democratic Party (United States)]] regained control of Congress in the [[2006 midterm elections]].
Bush]], though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.[371] The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[372] the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the [[Geneva Conventions]].[373] Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]] (D-[[Ohio]]), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of [[United States House of Representatives]] against Bush on June 9, 2008, but [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-[[California]]) declared that impeachment was "off the table".[374]
In April 2008, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the [[Gallup poll]], with 69 percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving – although the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[375]
In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent,[376][377] while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent.[377][378] In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Harry S.
Truman]], the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s ([[Richard Nixon]]'s final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent).[379] According to a [[CBS News]]/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, the lowest in American history.[376]
Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global [[Anti-war]] and [[Anti-globalization]] movements for his administration's foreign policy.[380][381] Views of him within the international community – even in France, a close ally of the United States – were more negative than those of most previous American presidents.[382]
Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and [[Vicente Fox]] of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[383][384][385] Other leaders, such as [[Hamid Karzai]] of Afghanistan,[386] [[Yoweri Museveni]] of Uganda,[387] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] of Spain,[388] and [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela,[389] openly criticized the president.
Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and [[Vladimir Putin]], which led to a cooling of their relationship.[390]
Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[391][392] In 2007, the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[393] The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express "a lot of confidence" or "some confidence" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[394] A March 2007 survey of public opinion in six Arab nations conducted by Zogby International and the [[University of Maryland]] found that Bush was the most disliked world leader.[395]
During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[396] [[Albania]], Bush was greeted enthusiastically.

Bush appeared on [[NBC]]'s [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] on November 19, 2013, along with his wife Laura.

He continued, "Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation", while urging citizens to oppose threats to American democracy and be positive role models for young people.[447] The speech was widely interpreted as a denouncement of Donald Trump and [[Political positions of Donald Trump]], despite Bush not mentioning Trump by name.[447][448][449][450]

Bush]], both during and after his presidency.[502][503][504] He has had [[List of nicknames of presidents of the United States#George W.
Bush presidency has been ranked as below-average in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] published in the late 2000s and 2010s.[508][509][510]
A 2010 [[Siena Research Institute]] survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents.
Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office."[514] Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[515] A poll conducted in June 2013 marked the first time recorded by Gallup where his ratings have been more positive than negative, with 49 percent viewing him favorably compared to 46 percent unfavorably.[516] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement  in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[517] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for [[The Washington Post]] and [[American Broadcasting Company]], his highest approval rating since December 2005.[518] Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent).[519] His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[518] A [[CNN]] poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43 percent of independents calling it a success.[520] Bush's public image saw greater improvement in 2017, with a [[YouGov]] survey showing 51 percent of favorability from Democrats.[521] A 2018 CNN poll subsequently found that 61 percent of respondents held a favorable view of Bush, an increase of nine points from 2015.[522] The improvement has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to [[First presidency of Donald Trump]],[523][524][525] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[526]
A street in [[Tirana]], located directly outside the [[Albanian Parliament]] and formerly known as Rruga Punëtorët e Rilindjes, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.[400] In 2012, Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] awarded Bush the [[Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana]] for his work in expanding NATO.[527] Two elementary schools are named after him: one in [[Stockton Unified School District]] in [[Stockton, California]],[528] and one in [[Wylie Independent School District (Collin County, Texas)]] in [[St. Paul, Collin County, Texas]], in the [[Dallas-Fort Worth]] area.[529]
