The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.[1] It was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years.
In addition, PISA's international comparisons can be used to justify reforms with which the data themselves have no connection; in Portugal, for example, PISA data were used to justify new arrangements for teacher assessment (based on inferences that were not justified by the assessments and data themselves); they also fed the government's discourse about the issue of pupils repeating a year, (which, according to research, fails to improve student results).[18] In Finland, the country's PISA results (that are in other countries deemed to be excellent) were used by Ministers to promote new policies for 'gifted' students.[19] Such uses and interpretations often assume causal relationships that cannot legitimately be based upon PISA data which would normally require fuller investigation through qualitative in-depth studies and [[Longitudinal surveys]] based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods,[20] which politicians are often reluctant to fund.
PISA stands in a tradition of international school studies, undertaken since the late 1950s by the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] (IEA).
Much of PISA's methodology follows the example of the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS, started in 1995), which in turn was much influenced by the U.S. [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP).
The reading component of PISA is inspired by the IEA's [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).
PISA aims to test [[Literacy]] of students in three competence fields: reading, mathematics, science on an indefinite scale.[22]
PISA claims to measure education's application to real-life problems and [[Lifelong learning]] (workforce knowledge).
In small countries like [[Iceland]] and [[Luxembourg]], where there are fewer than 5,000 students per year, an entire age cohort is tested.
In selected countries, PISA started experimentation with [[Computer adaptive testing]].
Scores are thus scaled so that the OECD average in each domain (mathematics, reading and science) is 500 and the [[Standard deviation]] is 100.[27] This is true only for the initial PISA cycle when the scale was first introduced, though, subsequent cycles are linked to the previous cycles through IRT scale linking methods.[28]
This generation of proficiency estimates is done using a latent regression extension of the [[Rasch model]], a model of [[Item response theory]] (IRT), also known as conditioning model or population model.
The latent regression, together with the use of a Gaussian [[Prior probability]] distribution of student competencies allows estimation of the proficiency distributions of groups of participating students.[29] The scaling and conditioning procedures are described in nearly identical terms in the Technical Reports of PISA 2000, 2003, 2006.
In the official reports, however, country-by-country rankings are given not as simple league tables but as cross tables indicating for each pair of countries whether or not mean score differences are [[Statistical significance]] (unlikely to be due to random fluctuations in student sampling or in item functioning).
The results of PISA 2022 were presented on 5 December 2023, which included data for around 700,000 participating students in 81 countries and economies, with [[Singapore]] emerging as the top performer in all categories.[30]
Both [[Lebanon]] and the Chinese provinces/municipalities of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] participated this edition, but their results were not published as they were not able to fully collect data because of COVID restrictions.[31]
Because of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], only 18 of 27 Ukrainian regions had their data collected, thus the results are not representative of the following regions: [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]], [[Donetsk Oblast]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Luhansk Oblast]], [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]], [[Kherson Oblast]], [[Mykolaiv Oblast]], the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and the city of [[Sevastopol]].[32]
China's participation in the 2012 test was limited to [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]] as separate entities.
Educational experts debated to what degree this result reflected the quality of the [[Education in China]], pointing out that Shanghai has greater wealth and better-paid teachers than the rest of China.[43] Hong Kong placed second in reading and science and third in maths.
[[Andreas Schleicher]], PISA division head and co-ordinator, stated that PISA tests administered in rural China have produced some results approaching the OECD average.
In 2018 the Chinese provinces that participated were [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]].
In 2015, the participating provinces were Jiangsu, [[Guangdong]], Beijing, and Shanghai.[46] The 2015 Beijing-Shanghai-Jiangsu-Guangdong cohort scored a median 518 in science in 2015, while the 2012 Shanghai cohort scored a median 580.
Critics of PISA counter that in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents' hometowns for high school due to [[Hukou system]] restrictions, thus skewing the composition of the city's high school students in favor of wealthier local families.
A population chart of Shanghai reproduced in [[The New York Times]] shows a steep drop off in the number of 15-year-olds residing there.[47] According to Schleicher, 27% of Shanghai's 15-year-olds are excluded from its school system (and hence from testing).
In 2014, [[Liz Truss]], the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the [[Department for Education]], led a fact-finding visit to schools and teacher-training centres in Shanghai.[50] Britain increased exchanges with Chinese teachers and schools to find out how to improve quality.
It was also the first time pupils in Finnish-speaking schools did not perform better than pupils in [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] schools.
Former minister of Education and Science [[Krista Kiuru]] expressed concern for the overall drop, as well as the fact that the number of low-performers had increased from 7% to 12%.[56]
A [[Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan]] (KVS) committee as well as a group of secretaries on education constituted by the [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Narendra Modi]] recommended that India should participate in PISA.
Accordingly, in February 2017, the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]] under [[Prakash Javadekar]] decided to end the boycott and participate in PISA from 2020.
India did not participate in the 2022 PISA rounds citing due to [[COVID-19 pandemic]] disruption.[62]
In 2015, the results from Malaysia were found by the OECD to have not met the maximum response rate.[63] Opposition politician [[Ong Kian Ming]] said the education ministry tried to oversample high-performing students in rich schools.[64][65]
The country performed below the OECD average in all three subjects.[66] The leader of the opposition, [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] [[Stefan Löfven]], described the situation as a national crisis.[67] Along with the party's spokesperson on education, [[Ibrahim Baylan]], he pointed to the downward trend in reading as most severe.[67]
In 2020, Swedish newspaper [[Expressen]] revealed that Sweden had inflated their score in PISA 2018 by not conforming to OECD standards.
According to professor [[Magnus Henrekson]] a large number of foreign-born students had not been tested.[68]
In the 2012 test, as in 2009, the result was slightly above average for the United Kingdom, with the science ranking being highest (20).[69] [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] also participated as separated entities, showing the worst result for Wales which in mathematics was 43rd of the 65 countries and economies.
Minister of Education in Wales [[Huw Lewis]] expressed disappointment in the results, said that there were no "quick fixes", but hoped that several educational reforms that have been implemented in the last few years would give better results in the next round of tests.[70] The United Kingdom had a greater gap between high- and low-scoring students than the average.
There was little difference between public and private schools when adjusted for [[Socio-economic]] background of students.
Writing in the [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] warned against putting too much emphasis on the UK's international ranking, arguing that an overfocus on scholarly performances in East Asia might have contributed to the area's low [[Birthrate]], which he argued could harm the economic performance in the future more than a good PISA score would outweigh.[71]
In 2013, the [[Times Educational Supplement]] (TES) published an article, "Is PISA Fundamentally Flawed?" by William Stewart, detailing serious critiques of PISA's conceptual foundations and methods advanced by statisticians at major universities.[72]
In the article, Professor [[Harvey Goldstein]] of the [[University of Bristol]] was quoted as saying that when the OECD tries to rule out questions suspected of bias, it can have the effect of "smoothing out" key differences between countries.
[[Queen's University Belfast]] mathematician Dr. Hugh Morrison stated that he found the statistical model underlying PISA to contain a fundamental, insoluble mathematical error that renders Pisa rankings "valueless".[73] Goldstein remarked that Dr. Morrison's objection highlights "an important technical issue" if not a "profound conceptual error".
Professor Svend Kreiner, of the [[University of Copenhagen]], agreed: "One of the problems that everybody has with PISA is that they don't want to discuss things with people criticising or asking questions concerning the results.
Although PISA and TIMSS officials and researchers themselves generally refrain from hypothesizing about the large and stable differences in student achievement between countries, since 2000, literature on the differences in PISA and TIMSS results and their possible causes has emerged.[80] Data from PISA have furnished several researchers, notably [[Eric Hanushek]], [[Ludger Wößmann]], Heiner Rindermann, and Stephen J.
Ceci, with material for books and articles about the relationship between student achievement and economic development,[81] [[Democratization]], and health;[82] as well as the roles of such single educational factors as high-stakes exams,[83] the presence or absence of private schools and the effects and timing of ability tracking.[84]
[[David Spiegelhalter]] of Cambridge wrote: "Pisa does present the uncertainty in the scores and ranks - for example the [[United Kingdom]] rank in the 65 countries is said to be between 23 and 31.
It's unwise for countries to base education policy on their Pisa results, as [[Germany]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] did after doing badly in 2001."[86]
According to [[Forbes]], an American media outlet, in an opinion article, some countries such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Argentina]] select PISA samples from only the best-educated areas or from their top-performing students, slanting the results.[87]
According to an open letter to [[Andreas Schleicher]], director of PISA, various academics and educators argued that "OECD and Pisa tests are damaging education worldwide".[88]
According to [[O Estado de São Paulo]], Brazil shows a great disparity when classifying the results between public and private schools, where public schools would rank worse than Peru, while private schools would rank better than Finland.[89]
