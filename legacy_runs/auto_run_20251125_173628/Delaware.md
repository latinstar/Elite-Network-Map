Delaware (/ˈdɛləwɛər/ ⓘ DEL-ə-wair)[10] is a [[U.S. state]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)]] and [[South Atlantic states]][11] regions of the United States.[12] It borders [[Maryland]] to its south and west, [[Pennsylvania]] to its north, [[New Jersey]] to its northeast, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to its east.
The state's name derives from the adjacent [[Delaware Bay]], which in turn was named after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], an English nobleman and the [[Colony of Virginia]]'s first colonial-era governor.[13]
Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], and some islands and territory within the [[Delaware River]].
It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population]] state, but also the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density]].
Delaware's most populous city is [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and the state's [[List of capitals in the United States]] is [[Dover, Delaware]], the second-most populous city in Delaware.
The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: [[New Castle County, Delaware]], [[Kent County, Delaware]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware]].
New Castle is more [[Urbanized area]] and is considered part of the [[Philadelphia metropolitan area]].
Delaware is considered part of the [[Southern United States]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]],[14] but the state's geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic, [[Northeastern United States]], and Southern regions of the country.[15][16][17]
Before the Delaware coastline was explored and developed by [[Ethnic groups in Europe]] in the 17th century, the state was inhabited by several [[Native Americans in the United States]] tribes, including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke people]] in the south.
The state was first colonized by [[Dutch people]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony]], near present-day [[Lewes, Delaware]], in 1631.
Delaware was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that participated in the [[American Revolution]] against [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War]], which established the United States as an independent nation.
On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the [[Constitution of the United States]], earning it the nickname "The First State".[18]
Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore [[Corporate haven]] whose [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all [[New York Stock Exchange]]-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the [[Fortune 500]] are legally incorporated in Delaware.
Over 90% of all U.S. based companies that went [[Initial public offering]] in 2021 incorporated themselves in Delaware.[19]
Delaware was named after its location on the Delaware Bay, which in turn derived its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] (1577–1618), the first governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]].
The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for [[Lenape]] people Indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.
The name de La Warr was derived from [[Sussex]] and is of [[England]]-French origin.[20][21] It came probably from a [[Norman language]] [[Lieu-dit]] La Guerre.
This [[Toponymic]] likely derived from [[Latin language]] ager, the [[Breton language]] gwern or from the [[Late Latin]] varectum ([[Fallow]]).
The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire, (the sound [[Open central unrounded vowel]] often mutated in [[Near-open front unrounded vowel]]) also appear in historical texts cited by [[Lucien Musset]], where the word ga(i)ra means [[Gore (road)]].
It could also be linked with a [[Patronymic]] from the [[Old Norse]] verr.
Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the present-day state was home to the Eastern [[Algonquian peoples]] tribes known as the Unami [[Lenape]], or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the [[Nanticoke people]] who occupied much of the southern [[Delmarva Peninsula]].
John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and [[Tockwogh]], living north of the Nanticoke—they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay.[22] The Kuskarawocks were most likely the [[Tuscarora people]].
The Unami Lenape in the [[Delaware Valley]] were closely related to [[Munsee]] Lenape tribes along the [[Hudson River]].
They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]].
With the loss of their lands on the [[Delaware River]] and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Allegheny Mountains]] by the mid-18th century.
The [[Dutch people]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware]] in 1631.[23] Within a year, all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States]] living in the area.
In 1638, [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people]] and Dutch.
In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware]] and, in 1655, they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].[24][25] Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of [[James II of England]].
Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682.
Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania]] and leased what then came to be known as the "Lower Counties on the Delaware"[24] from the Duke.
However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had grown so large their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle.
Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].
New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act 1765]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)]] became the "Penman of the Revolution".
Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776.
The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence.
Initially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the "Delaware Blues" and nicknamed the "[[Delaware Blue Hen]]".
In August 1777 [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia.
The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County, although there was a [[Clow Rebellion]] in 1778.
Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[List of governors of Delaware]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner.
The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County.
Following the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.
Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]], where the population had been increasing rapidly.
The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African [[Slavery in the United States]] because of a decline in working class immigrants from England.
Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[Indentured servitude]] (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.[citation needed]
In addition local [[Methodist]] and [[Quaker]] encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons.
By the [[United States Census, 1860]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War]], 91.7% of the black population were free;[32] 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 "free colored persons".[33]
An independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)]] as the "[[Spencer Churches]]".
This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] by [[Richard Allen (bishop)]], which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816.
Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.[34] This was renamed as the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P. Church]].
In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the [[Big August Quarterly]], which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival.[35]
Delaware voted against [[Secession]] on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union.
While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[List of Maryland Confederate Civil War units]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units]] Regiments.
Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled.[citation needed] Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War[further explanation needed] but rejected the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869.
During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States]] that followed the [[American Civil War]], Democratic [[Redeemers]] governments led by the South's [[Bourbon Democrats]] continued to dominate the region and imposed explicitly [[White supremacist]] regimes in the former slave states.
The Delaware legislature declared Black people to be second-class citizens in 1866, and restricted their voting rights despite the 15th Amendment, ensuring continued Democratic success in the state throughout most of the 19th century.[37] Fearful that the [[1875 Civil Rights Act]] passed by Congress might establish racial equality, Delaware legislators passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that mandated [[Racial segregation]] in public facilities.
Investment in manufacturing in the city grew from $5.5 million in 1860 to $44 million in 1900.[40] The most notable manufacturer in the state was the chemical company [[DuPont]], which to this day is heavily credited with making the state what it is today in many ways.[41] Because of Wilmington's growth, local politicians from the city and New Castle County pressured the state government to adopt a new constitution providing the north with more representation.
Edward Addicks]] attempted to buy a US Senate seat multiple times in a rivalry with the Du Ponts until the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].[43] The allegiance of industries with the Republican party allowed them to gain control of the state's governorship throughout most of the 20th century.
It produced nylon in the state after the war and began investments into [[General Motors]].[45] Additionally, the company invested heavily in the expansion of public schools in the state and colleges such as the [[University of Delaware]] in the 1910s and 1920s.
This included primary and secondary schools for Black people and women.[46] Delaware suffered less during the [[Great Depression]] than other states, but the depression spurred further migration from the rural south to urban areas.[47]
The proportion of blacks constituting the city's population rose from 15% in 1950 to over 50% by 1980.[48] The surge of Black migrants to the north sparked [[White flight]], in which middle class whites moved from the city to suburban areas, leading to de facto segregation of Northern Delaware's society.
In the 1940s and 1950s, Delaware attempted to integrate its schools, although the last segregated school in the state did not close until 1970.[49] The [[University of Delaware]] admitted its first black student in 1948, and local courts ruled that primary schools had to be integrated.
Board of Education]], which found racial segregation in United States [[State school]] to be unconstitutional.[50] The result of the Brown ruling was that Delaware became fully integrated, albeit with time and much effort.
In October 1954, the city of [[Milford, Delaware]] became the scene of one of the country's first pro-segregation [[Boycotts]] after eleven Black students were enrolled in the previously all-white [[Milford High School (Delaware)]].
Mass protests continued in Milford; the school board eventually ceded to the protestors, expelling the Black students.[51][52][53] The ensuing unrest, which included [[Cross burning]], rallies, and pro-segregation demonstrations, contributed to [[Desegregation in the United States]] in most of Southern Delaware being delayed for another ten years.
[[Sussex County, Delaware]] did not start closing or integrating its segregated schools until 1965, 11 years after the Brown ruling.[54] Throughout the state, integration only encouraged more white flight, and poor economic conditions for the black population led to some violence during the 1960s.
Riots broke out in Wilmington in 1967 and again in [[Wilmington riot of 1968]], after which the National Guard occupied the city for nine months to prevent further violence.[55]
Since WWII, the state has been generally economically prosperous and enjoyed relatively high per capita income because of its location between major cities like Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC.[56] Its population grew rapidly, particularly in the suburbs in the north where New Castle county became an extension of the [[Philadelphia metropolitan area]].[57] Americans, including migrants from Puerto Rico, and immigrants from Latin America flocked to the state.
Delaware is 96 miles (154 km) long and ranges from 9 to 35 miles (14 to 56 km) across, with a land area of 1,982 square miles (5,130 km2)[59] and a total area of 2,489 square miles (6,450 km2),[60] making it the second-smallest state by either metric in the United States after [[Rhode Island]].
Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]], and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]].
The state of Delaware, together with the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]] and [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]], form the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending 12 miles (19.3 km) from the [[Cupola]] of the courthouse in the city of [[New Castle, Delaware]].[61] This boundary is often referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].[b] Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the U.S. that is a true [[Arc (geometry)]], the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs,[62] and many cities in the South (such as [[Plains, Georgia]])[63] also have circular boundaries.
This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12-mile (19 km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[Thalweg]]) of the Delaware River.
On the west, Delaware and Maryland are mostly separated by a line running from the midpoint of the [[Transpeninsular Line]], going slightly west of due north up to its tangent point on the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].
The border follows the Circle for a short distance and then continues in a straight line due north until reaching the southern border of Pennsylvania.[64] [[The Wedge (border)]] of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.
Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation.[65] Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)]], is less than 450 feet (140 m) above sea level.[65] The northernmost part of the state is part of the [[Piedmont (United States)]] with hills and rolling surfaces.
The [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] approximately follows the [[Delaware Route 2]] between [[Newark, Delaware]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]]; south of this road is the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground.[66] A ridge about 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the [[Drainage basin]] that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the west.
Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the effects of the ocean moderate its climate.
The state lies in the [[Humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen Cfa) zone.
Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and [[Delaware Bay]], the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state.
The milder climate in southern Delaware allows for [[Subtropical]] [[Flora]] such as the [[Windmill palm]], [[Needle palm]], and [[Dwarf palmetto]].
Delaware's all-time record high of 110 °F (43 °C) was recorded at [[Millsboro, Delaware]] on July 21, 1930.
The [[Hardiness zone]] are 7B and 8A at the [[Delaware Beaches]].
In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and mixed [[Quercus]] forests typical of the northeastern United States.[67] In the southern two-thirds of the state are found [[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]].[67] [[Trap Pond State Park]], along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of [[Taxodium distichum]] trees in North America.
Delaware provides [[Government subsidy]] for the [[Environmental remediation]] of property "lightly contaminated" by [[Hazardous waste]], the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.[68]
The table below lists the ten largest municipalities in the state based on the [[2020 United States census]].[69]
The [[United States Census Bureau]] determined that the population of Delaware was 989,948 on April 1, 2020,[72] an increase from the [[2010 United States census]] figure of 897,934.[73][74]
Delaware's history as a [[Border states (Civil War)]] has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the [[Northern United States]] and the [[Southern United States]] regions of the United States.
Generally, the rural Southern (or "Slower Lower") regions of Delaware below the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] embody a [[Culture of the Southern United States]],[15][16] while densely populated Northern Delaware above the canal—particularly Wilmington, a part of the [[Philadelphia metropolitan area]]—has more in common with that of the [[Northeastern United States]] and the [[Northern United States]].[17] The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the [[South Atlantic States]],[14] but it is commonly associated with the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] or [[Northeastern (United States)]] United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.[75][76][77][78][79][80]
Delaware is one of five U.S. states ([[Maine]], [[Vermont]], [[West Virginia]], [[Wyoming]]) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census.[81] The [[Center of population]] of Delaware is in New Castle County, in the town of [[Townsend, Delaware]].[82]
According to [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s 2022 [[Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress]], there were an estimated 2,369 [[Homelessness]] people in Delaware.[83][84]
According to the 2010 United States census, the racial composition of the state was 68.9% [[White American]] (65.3% [[Non-Hispanic White]], 3.6% White Hispanic), 21.4% [[African American]] or African American, 0.5% [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[Alaska Native]], 3.2% Asian American, 0.0% [[Native Hawaiian]] and other [[Pacific Islander]], 3.4% some other race, and 2.7% of [[Multiracial American]].
People of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] or Latino origin, of any race, made up 8.2% of the population.[85]
The 2022 [[American Community Survey]] estimated the state had a racial and ethnic makeup of 60.6% non-Hispanic whites, 23.6% Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.9% multiracial, and 10.1% Hispanic or Latin American of any race.[86]
In the Native American community, the state has a Native American group, called in their own language [[Lenape]], which was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware.[87] A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.[88]
A group of Native Americans in Delaware of mixed ethnicity, the [[Delaware Moors]], live in Cheswold.
The top countries of origin for Delaware's immigrants in 2018 were [[Mexico]], [[India]], [[Guatemala]], [[China]], and [[Jamaica]].[94]
Legislation has been proposed in both the House and the Senate in Delaware to designate English as the [[Languages of the United States]].[106][107] Neither bill was passed in the legislature.
The predominant religion practiced in Delaware is [[Christianity in the United States]].
A 2014 estimate by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that members of [[Protestantism]] churches accounted for almost half of the population,[111] though the [[Catholic Church]] was the largest single denomination in the state.
By 2020, the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] determined 61% of the population was Christian.[112] In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute's survey revealed 60% were Christian, followed by [[Judaism in the United States]] (3%), [[Hinduism in the United States]] (1%), and [[New Age]] (1%).[110]
The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] reported in 2010 that the three largest Christian denominational groups in Delaware by number of adherents are the [[Catholic Church]] at 182,532 adherents, the [[United Methodist Church]] with 53,656 members reported, and non-denominational [[Evangelicalism]], who numbered 22,973.[113] In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Christian denominations were the Catholic Church with 197,094; non-denominational Protestants with 49,392, and United Methodists with 39,959.[114]
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Delaware]] oversee the parishes within their denominations.
The [[A.U.M.P. Church]], the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington.
Reflecting new immigrant populations, an [[Mosque]] has been built in the [[Ogletown, Delaware]] area, and a [[Hindu Temple of Delaware]].
Delaware is home to an [[Amish]] community which resides west of [[Dover, Delaware]] in [[Kent County, Delaware]], consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people.
A 2012 survey of religious attitudes in the United States found that 34% of Delaware residents considered themselves "moderately religious", 33% "very religious", and 33% as "non-religious".[118] At the 2014 [[Pew Research Center]] survey, 23% of the population were irreligious; the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute's survey determined 31% of the population were irreligious.[112] In 2022, the same study showed 33% of the population as irreligious.[110]
Delaware's agricultural output consists of poultry, nursery stock, [[Soybeans]], dairy products and [[Maize]].
Since the mid-2000s, Delaware has seen the departure of the state's automotive manufacturing industry ([[General Motors]] [[Wilmington Assembly]] and [[Chrysler]] [[Newark Assembly]]), the corporate buyout of a major bank holding company ([[MBNA]]), the departure of the state's steel industry ([[Evraz Claymont Steel]]), the bankruptcy of a fiber mill ([[National Vulcanized Fiber]]),[123] and the diminishing presence of [[AstraZeneca]] in Wilmington.[124][125]
In late 2015, DuPont announced that 1,700 employees, nearly a third of its footprint in Delaware, would be laid off in early 2016.[126] The merger of [[DuPont (1802–2017)]] and [[Dow Chemical Company]] into [[DuPont]] took place on September 1, 2017.[127][128][129][130]
More than half of all U.S. publicly traded companies, and 63% of the [[Fortune 500]], are [[Incorporation (business)]] in Delaware.[131] The state's attractiveness as a [[Corporate haven]] is largely because of its business-friendly [[Delaware General Corporation Law]].
[[Franchise tax]] on Delaware corporations supply about a fifth of the state's revenue.[132] Although "USA (Delaware)" ranked as the world's most opaque jurisdiction on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s 2009 Financial Secrecy Index,[133] the same group's 2011 Index ranks the U.S. fifth and does not specify Delaware.[134] In Delaware, there are more than a million registered corporations,[131] meaning there are more corporations than people.
Title 4, chapter 7 of the Delaware Code stipulates that alcoholic liquor be sold only in specifically licensed establishments, and only between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m.[135] Until 2003, Delaware was among the several states enforcing [[Blue law]] and banned the sale of liquor on Sunday.[136]
Two [[Daily newspaper]] are based in Delaware, the [[Delaware State News]], based in Dover and covering the two southern counties, and [[The News Journal]] covering Wilmington and northern Delaware.
The state is also served by [[List of newspapers in Delaware]].
The northern part of the state is served by network stations in [[Philadelphia]] and the southern part by network stations in [[Salisbury, Maryland]].

Board of Education]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision that led to the end of officially [[Racial segregation]] public schools.
As of 2011[update], the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 charter schools in the state, one of them being [[Single-sex education]].[142]
All teachers in the State's public school districts are unionized.[144] As of January 2012[update], none of the State's charter schools are members of a teachers [[Trade union]].[144] One of the State's teachers' unions is Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).[144]
The transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the [[Delaware Department of Transportation]] (DelDOT).[146][147] Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations.[148] DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware [[Adopt-a-Highway]] program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware [[Division of Motor Vehicles]], the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as "[[DART First State]]", the state government public transportation organization), and others.
One major branch of the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 95 in Delaware]] (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County.
Two [[Auxiliary Interstate Highway]] routes are also located in the state.
[[Interstate 495 (Delaware)]] is an eastern bypass of Wilmington.
[[Interstate 295 (Delaware–Pennsylvania)]] is a bypass of Philadelphia which begins south of Wilmington.
In addition to Interstate highways, there are six [[U.S. Highway System]] that serve Delaware: [[U.S. Route 9 in Delaware]], [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware]], [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware]], [[U.S. Route 113 in Delaware]], [[U.S. Route 202 in Delaware]], and [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware]].
There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include [[Delaware Route 1]], [[Delaware Route 9]], and [[Delaware Route 404]].
U.S. 13 and DE 1 are primary north–south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE 1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the [[Delaware beaches]].
