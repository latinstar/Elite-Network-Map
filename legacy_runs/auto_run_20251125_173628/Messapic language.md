Messapic (/mɛˈsæpɪk, mə-, -ˈseɪ-/; also known as Messapian; or as Iapygian) is an extinct [[Indo-European languages]] [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] of the southeastern [[Italian Peninsula]], once spoken in an area that roughly coincided with the modern region of [[Apulia]] by the [[Iapygians]] peoples: the Calabri and Salentini (known collectively as the [[Messapians]]), the [[Peucetians]] and the [[Daunians]].[6][7] Messapic was the pre-[[Roman Republic]], non-[[Italic languages]] language of [[Apulia]].
It has been preserved in about 600 inscriptions written in an alphabet derived from a [[Archaic Greek alphabets]] and dating from the mid-6th to at least the 2nd century BC, when it went extinct following the [[Roman Republic]] conquest of the region.[8][1][2]
In current classifications of the Indo-European language family, Messapic is grouped in [[Albanoid]] with [[Albanian language]],[9] which is supported by available fragmentary linguistic evidence that shows common characteristic innovations and a number of significant lexical correspondences between the two languages,[10] and notably within the [[Centum and satem languages]] they both feature the (partial) retention of the Proto-Indo-European three-way contrast for dorsal stops, which is limited only to them among the historical languages of the [[Balkans]] and [[Adriatic Sea]] (a similar feature is also evident in [[Luwian language]] of the [[Anatolian languages]] and in [[Armenian language]]).[11] Proto-Messapic migration from the opposite Adriatic coast through a trans-Adriatic interaction network is also confirmed by recent archaeological evidence dating to the period between 1700 BCE and 1400 BCE, in the post-[[Cetina culture]].[11]
The term 'Messapic' or 'Messapian' is traditionally used to refer to a group of languages spoken by the [[Iapygians]], a "relatively homogeneous linguistic community" of non-[[Italic languages]]-speaking tribes ([[Messapii]], [[Peucetians]] and [[Daunians]]) dwelling in the region of [[Apulia]] before the Roman conquest.[6]
However, some scholars have argued that the term '[[Iapygians]] languages' should be preferred for referring to the group of languages spoken in Apulia, with the term 'Messapic' being reserved to the inscriptions found in the [[Salento]], where the specific tribe of the Messapians had been living in the pre-Roman era.[6]
The name Apulia itself derives from Iapygia after passing from Greek to [[Oscan language]] to Latin and undergoing subsequent morphological shifts.[7]

Messapic was a non-[[Italic languages]] and non-Greek [[Indo-European languages]] of [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] origin.[12][13][14][15] Modern archeological and linguistic research and some ancient sources hold that the ancestors of the [[Iapygians]] came to Southeastern Italy (present-day [[Apulia]]) from the [[Western Balkans]] across the [[Adriatic Sea]] during the early first millennium BC.[16][note 2][note 3]
Messapic forms part of the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]].
Based upon lexical similarities with the [[Illyrian languages]], some scholars contend that Messapic may have developed from a dialect of pre-Illyrian, meaning that it would have diverged substantially from the Illyrian language(s) spoken in the Balkans by the 5th century BC, while others considered it a direct dialect of Iron Age Illyrian.
[[Eric Hamp]] has grouped them under "Messapo-Illyrian", which is further grouped with Albanian under "Adriatic Indo-European".[18] Other schemes group the three languages under "General Illyrian" and "Western Paleo-Balkan".[19]
A number of shared features between Messapic and [[Proto-Albanian language]] may have emerged either as a result of linguistic contacts between Proto-Messapic and Pre-Proto-Albanian within the Balkan peninsula in prehistoric times, or of a closer relation as shown by the quality of the correspondences in the lexical area and shared innovations between Messapic and Albanian.[20] Hyllested & Joseph (2022) identify Messapic as the closest language to Albanian, with which it forms a common branch titled Illyric.
Hyllested & Joseph (2022) in agreement with recent bibliography identify [[Graeco-Phrygian]] as the IE branch closest to the Albanian-Messapic one.
Although the Illyrian languages – and to some extent Messapic itself – are too scarcely attested to allow for an extensive linguistic comparison,[22][note 4] the Messapic language is generally regarded as related to, though distinct from, the [[Illyrian languages]].[23] This theory is supported by a series of similar personal and place names from both sides of the [[Adriatic Sea]].
Proposed [[Cognate]] in Illyrian and Messapic, respectively, include: '[[Bardylis]]/Barzidihi', '[[Teuta]]/Teutā', 'Dazios/Dazes', 'Laidias/Ladi-', 'Platōr/Plator-', '[[Iapydes]]/[[Iapygians]]', 'Apulus/Apuli', '[[Dalmatae]]/Dalmathus', 'Peucetioe/[[Peucetians]]', 'Ana/Ana', 'Beuzas/Bozat', 'Thana/Thana', '[[Deipaturos]]/[[Damatura]]'.[24]
The linguistic data of [[Albanian language]] can be used to compensate for the lack of fundamental information on Illyrian, since [[Proto-Albanian language]] (the ancestor language of [[Albanian language]]) was likewise an Indo-European language certainly spoken in the Balkans in antiquity,[25][26][27] and probably since at least the 7th century BC, as suggested by the presence of archaic loanwords from [[Ancient Greek]].[28][29][30][31]
A number of linguistic [[Cognate]] with Albanian have been proposed, such as Messapic aran and Albanian arë ("field"), biliā and bijë ("daughter"), or menza- and mëz ("[[Foal]]").[32] The [[Toponymy]] points to a link between the two languages, as some towns in Apulia have no etymological forms outside Albanian linguistic sources.[33] Other linguistic elements such as [[Grammatical particle]], [[Preposition]], [[Suffix]], [[Lexicon]], but also [[Toponym]], [[Anthroponym]] and [[Theonym]] of the Messapic language find singular affinities with Albanian.[34] Some [[Phonological]] data can also be compared between the two languages, and it seems likely that Messapic belongs, like Albanian, to a specific subgroup of the Indo-European languages that shows distinct reflections of all the three [[Dorsal consonant]] rows.
In the [[Nominal (linguistics)]] context, both Messapic and Albanian continue, in the masculine terms in -o-, the Indo-European ending *-osyo (Messapic -aihi, Albanian -i / -u).[35][36]
Regarding the verbal system, both Messapic and Albanian have formally and semantically preserved the two Indo-European [[Subjunctive]] and [[Optative]] moods.
However, except for the dorsal consonant rows, these similarities do not provide elements exclusively relating Messapic and Albanian, and only a few [[Morphology (linguistics)]] data are comparable.[35]
The development of a distinct [[Iapygians]] culture in southeastern Italy is widely considered to be the result of a confluence of local Apulian material cultures with Balkanic traditions following the cross-[[Adriatic Sea]] migrations of proto-Messapic speakers in the early first millennium BC.[37][38][39][40]
The Iapygians most likely left the eastern coasts of the Adriatic for the [[Italian Peninsula]] from the 11th century BC onwards,[41] merging with pre-existing [[Italic peoples]] and [[Mycenean civilisation]] cultures and providing a decisive cultural and linguistic imprint.[42] Throughout the second half of the 8th century, contacts between Messapians and Greeks must have been intense and continuous; they began to intensify after the foundation of [[Taranto]] by [[Sparta]] colonists around the end of the century.
Despite its geographical proximity with [[Magna Graecia]], however, Iapygia was generally not encompassed in [[Greek colonies]] territories, and with the exception of Taras, the inhabitants were evidently able to avoid other Greek colonies in the region.[42][43] During the 6th century BC Messapia, and more marginally Peucetia, underwent Hellenizing cultural influences, mainly from the nearby Taras.
The second great Hellenizing wave occurred during the 4th century BC, this time also involving Daunia and marking the beginning of [[Peuceti]] and [[Dauni]] epigraphic records, in a local variant of the Hellenistic alphabet that replaced the older Messapic script.[42][46][47]
Along with Messapic, [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Oscan language]] were spoken and written during the Romanization period all over [[Apulia]],[48] and bilingualism in Greek and Messapic was probably common in southern Apulia at that time.[49] Based upon the legends of the local currencies promoted by Rome, Messapic appears to have been written in the southern zone, Oscan in the northern area, while the central sector was a trilingual area where Messapic, Greek and Oscan co-existed in inscriptions.[48] Messapic epigraphic records seem to have ended by the 2nd century BC.[8] During the 1st century BCE, the language was replaced by Latin, which is the origin of the modern Italian Sallentine dialects of the region.[45]
A characteristic feature of Messapic is the absence of the Indo-European phonological opposition between the vowels /u/ and /o/, the language featuring only an o/u [[Phoneme]].
Consequently, the superfluous letter /u/ ([[Upsilon]]) was not taken over following the initial period of adaption of the [[Archaic Greek alphabets]].[50] The 'o/u' phoneme existed in opposition to an 'a/o' phoneme formed after the phonological distinction between *o and *a was abandoned.[51] The [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) vowel /o/ regularly appears as /a/ in inscriptions (e.g., Venas < *Wenos; menza < *mendyo; tabarā < *to-bhorā).[52][51] The original PIE phonological opposition between ō and o is still perceptible in Messapic.[51] The [[Diphthong]] *ou, itself reflecting the merged diphthongs *ou and eu, underwent [[Sound change]] to develop into ao, then into ō (e.g., *Toutor > Taotor > Θōtor).[51]
Another special letter, , occurs almost exclusively in Archaic inscriptions from the 6th and 5th centuries BC.[44] Multiple [[Palatalization (sound change)]] have also taken place, as in '[[Zis (deity)]]' < *dyēs, 'Artorres' < *Artōryos, or 'Bla(t)θes' < *Blatyos (where '(t)θ' probably denoted a dental affricate or spirant /ts/ or /tš/).[51] Proto-Indo-European *s was rather clearly reflected in initial and intervocalic positions as Messapic h, with notable examples including klaohi and hipa, but note Venas with *s in final position.[51][53]
The Proto-Indo-European [[Aspirated consonant]] *bh and *dh are certainly represented by the simple unaspirated voiced [[Obstruent]] /b/ and /d/ in Messapic (e.g., 'berain' < *bher-; '-des' < *dʰeh₁).[51] On the other hand, the outcomes of the Indo-European palatal, velar, and labiovelar stops remain unclear, with slender evidence.[51]
The Messapic alphabet is an adaptation of the [[Archaic Greek alphabets]], specifically the [[Laconia]]-[[Taranto]] version.[44] The actual Messapic inscriptions are attested from the 6th century BC onward, while the [[Peucetians]] and [[Daunians]] epigraphic record (written in a local variant of the Hellenistic alphabet rather than in the older Messapic script) only begins in the 4th century BC.[46][47]
The Greek letter Φ (/pʰ/) was not adopted, because it would have been superfluous for Messapic.[44] While [[Zeta]] "normally" represented the voiced counterpart to /s/, it may have been an affricate in some cases.[44] The value of Θ is unclear, but is clearly dental; it may be an affricate or a spirant.
The Messapic language is a 'fragmentary language' (Trümmersprache), preserved only in about 600 inscriptions from the mid-6th up until the late-2nd century BC.[57][58] Many of them consist of the personal names of the deceased engraved in burial sites (36% of the total), and only a few inscriptions have been definitely deciphered.[57][59][47] Some longer texts are also available, including those recently found in the Grotta della Poesia ([[Roca (archaeological site)]]), although they have not been fully exploited by scholars yet.[60] Most of the Messapic inscriptions are accessible in the Monumenta Linguae Messapicae (MLM), published in print in 2002.[47]

Since its settlement, Messapic was in contact with the [[Italic languages]] of the region.
In the centuries before Roman annexation, the frontier between Messapic and [[Oscan language]] ran through Frentania-[[Irpinia]]-[[Lucania]]-Apulia.
[[Larinum]], a settlement which has produced a large body of Oscan onomastics is described as a "Daunian city" and [[Horace]] who was from [[Venusia]] in the transboundary area between the Daunians and the Lucanians described himself as  "Lucanian or Apulian".
The Messapic verbal form eipeigrave ('wrote, incised'; variant ipigrave) is a notable loanword from Greek (with the initial stem eipigra-, ipigra- deriving from [[Epigraphy]], ἐπιγράφω, 'inscribe, engrave'), and is probably related to the fact that the Messapic alphabet has been borrowed from an Archaic Greek script.[122] Other Greek loanwords include argora-pandes ('coin officials', with the first part deriving from ἄργυρος),[122] and names of deities like [[Athena]] and perhaps Aprodita,[61][123] however the latter name is considered to be a Messapic theonym of an [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]] goddess.[124] It coincides with the [[Proto-Albanian]] *apro dītā 'come forth brightness of the day/dawn', which could be the original source of the Ancient Greek [[Aphrodite]], and which is preserved in the Albanian phrase [[Afrodita]] 'come forth the day/dawn', referring to the planet [[Venus]],[125] and also used to refer to [[Prende]], the dawn goddess, goddess of love, beauty, fertility, health and protector of women, in the [[Albanian paganism]], the equivalent of Ancient Greek Aphrodite.
Georgiev]] (1937), [[Eqrem Çabej]], [[Shaban Demiraj]] (1997), or [[Martin Litchfield West]] (2007) have argued that she was an Illyrian goddess eventually borrowed into Greek as [[Demeter]],[126][127] while others like [[Paul Kretschmer]] (1939), [[Robert S.
Beekes]] (2009) and [[Carlo De Simone (linguist)]] (2017) have argued for the contrary.[128][61] More recently it is considered a Messapic theonym of an Indo-European goddess by Marchesini (2021).[124]
