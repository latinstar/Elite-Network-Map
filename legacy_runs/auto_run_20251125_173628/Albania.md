Albania,[b] officially the Republic of Albania,[c] is a country in [[Southeast Europe]].
It is located in the [[Balkans]], on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Ionian Sea]] within the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and shares [[Land border]] with [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south.
Albania's landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the [[Accursed Mountains]] and the [[Korab]], [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains]], [[Pindus]] and [[Ceraunian Mountains]], to fertile lowland plains extending from the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] seacoasts.
[[Tirana]] is the capital and largest city in the country, followed by [[Durrës]], [[Vlorë]], and [[Shkodër]].
Albania was inhabited by several [[List of Illyrian peoples and tribes]], among them the [[Ardiaei]], [[Bylliones]], [[Dassaretii]], [[Enchele]], and [[Taulantii]], with the [[Chaonians]] settled in the southwest.
Several colonies were founded by the Ancient Greeks along the Albanian coast, most notably [[Apollonia (Illyria)]].
The [[Illyrian kingdom]] were the dominant power in Albania before the [[Rise of Macedon]].[8] Following the [[Illyrian Wars]], Albania was integrated into the [[Roman Empire]] and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after its [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].
During the Middle Ages, several [[Albanian principalities]] emerged, most notably the [[Principality of Arbanon]], [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)]] and [[Albania Veneta]].
In the 15th century, Albania became a center of resistance against [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] under the leadership of [[Skanderbeg]], whose military campaigns repelled Ottoman advances for over two decades.
Although incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]], Albania retained distinct cultural and social identities throughout four centuries of foreign rule, culminating in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] in the 19th century.
Albania [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912, followed by a turbulent 20th century marked by monarchy, foreign occupation during both World Wars, and a repressive [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]].[9]
Since its independence in 1912, Albania has undergone a number of political changes, transitioning from a [[Monarchy]] to a [[Communism]] regime before becoming a [[Sovereign state]] [[Parliamentary republic]] [[Constitutional republic]].
Governed by a [[Constitution of Albania]] prioritising the separation of powers, the country's political structure includes a [[Parliament of Albania]], a ceremonial [[President of Albania]], a functional [[Prime Minister of Albania]] and a hierarchy of courts.
Albania is a [[Developing country]] with an [[List of countries by GNI (nominal, Atlas method) per capita#Upper-middle-income group]] [[Economy of Albania]] driven by the service sector, with manufacturing and [[Tourism in Albania]], which attracted over 11 million visitors in 2024, also playing significant roles.[10] After the dissolution of its communist system the country shifted from [[Planned economy]] to an [[Open market]] [[Market economy]].
Albanian citizens have [[Universal health care]] access and free primary and secondary education.
The country is an official candidate for membership in the European Union and has been [[Accession of Albania to the European Union]] since 2022.
The origin of the name "Albania" can be traced back to [[Medieval Latin]] and the association with the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Albani (Illyrian tribe)]].
This connection is further supported  by the writings of the Ancient Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] during the 2nd century AD, where he included the settlement of [[Albanopolis]] situated to the northeast of [[Durrës]].[11][12] The presence of a medieval settlement named [[Principality of Arbanon]] or Arbanon hints at the possibility of historical continuity.
The Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], in his 11th-century historical account, provides the earliest undisputed reference to the Albanians, when he mentions them as participants in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1079.[14] He also identifies the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of [[Durrës]].[15] In the Middle Ages, Albania was denoted as Arbëri or Arbëni by its inhabitants, who identified themselves as Arbëreshë or Arbëneshë.[16] Albanians employ the terms Shqipëri or Shqipëria for their nation, designations that trace their historical origins to the 14th century.[17] But only in the late 17th and early 18th centuries did these terms gradually supersede Arbëria and Arbëreshë among Albanians.[17][18] These two expressions are widely interpreted to symbolise "Children of the Eagles" and "Land of the Eagles".[19][20]
Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include [[Flint]] and [[Jasper]] objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]].[21] The [[Neolithic]] era in Albania began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture.
A part of the Neolithic population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in the [[Konispol]] cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds.
[[Cardium pottery]] culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500 BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed the [[Starčevo culture]].[22] The Albanian [[Bitumen]] mines of [[Selenicë]] provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic Albania (from 5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration, [[Waterproofing]], and [[Adhesive]] for reparing broken vessels.
First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern [[Italy]].
The [[Indo-European migrations]] of Albania in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began after 2800 BC.
The presence of the Early Bronze Age [[Tumulus]] in the vicinity of later [[Apollonia (Illyria)]] dates to 2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC).
These burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [[Cetina culture]]) which moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans.
The same community built similar mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern Albania (Shtoj).[24] The first [[Archaeogenetics]] find related to the IE-isation of Albania involves a man with predominantly [[Western Steppe Herders]] buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663–2472 calBC.[25] During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania.
Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic from the [[Cetina]] of [[Dalmatia]].
In Albania, Cetina finds are concentrated around southern [[Lake Shkodër]] and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central Albania) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania).[26]
The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], amongst them numerous [[Illyrian tribes]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)]] tribes.
There were also several [[Greek colonization]].
The territory referred to as [[Illyria]] corresponded roughly to the area east of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] extending in the south to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]].[27][28] The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from [[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]], a Greek text written in the 4th century BC.[29] The [[Bryges]] were also present in central Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote [[Chaonians]], whose capital was at [[Phoenice]].[29][30][31] Other colonies such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)]] and [[Epidamnos]] were established by Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.[29][32][33]
The Illyrian [[Taulantii]] were a powerful Illyrian tribe among the earliest recorded tribes in the area.
Together with the Dardanian ruler [[Cleitus (son of Bardylis)]], [[Glaucias of Taulantii]], the ruler of the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Siege of Pelium]] in 335 BC.
As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [[Cassander]] captured Apollonia and crossed the river [[Shkumbin]] ([[Albanian language]]: Shkumbin) in 314 BC.
A few years later Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of [[Epidamnos]].[34]
The Illyrian [[Ardiaei]] tribe, centred in Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania.
Their [[Ardiaean Kingdom]] reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria]], the son of [[Pleuratus II]].
Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well.[35] Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, [[Teuta]], inherited the Ardiaean kingdom.
Teuta was eventually succeeded by [[Gentius]] in 181 BC.[38] Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the [[Third Illyrian War]].
The [[Roman Empire]] was split in 395 upon the death of [[Theodosius I]] into an [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Western Roman Empire]] in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [[Barbarian Invasions]].
From the 6th century into the 7th century, the [[South Slavs]] crossed the [[Danube]] and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the [[Balkans]]; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.[40][41]
In the 11th century, the [[Great Schism of 1054]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] that is reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south.
The Albanian people inhabited the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of [[Shkumbin]] and established the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in 1190 under the leadership of [[Progon of Kruja]].[42] The realm was succeeded by his sons [[Gjin Progoni]] and [[Dhimitër Progoni]].
Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the Albanian-Greek [[Gregory Kamonas]] and subsequently under the [[Golem of Kruja]].[43][44][45] In the 13th century, the principality was dissolved.[46][47][48] Arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an Albanian state, that retained a [[Semi-autonomous]] status as the western extremity of the [[Byzantine Empire]], under the Byzantine [[Doukas]] of [[Despotate of Epirus]] or [[Laskaris]] of [[Empire of Nicaea]].[49]
Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries, [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)]] and [[Venetian Empire]] started to take possession over the territory.[50] The [[Ethnogenesis]] of the Albanians is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of Albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the [[Albanoi]] as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]].[51] At this point the Albanians were fully Christianised.
After the dissolution of Arbanon, [[Charles I of Naples]] concluded an agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties.
In 1272, he established the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)]] and conquered regions back from the [[Despotate of Epirus]].
The kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from [[Dyrrhachium]] along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [[Butrint]].
A Catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [[Catholicism]] in the Balkan Peninsula.
This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou, Queen of Serbia]].
Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania.[52] Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [[Stefan Dusan]], to establish a [[Serbian Empire]] that included all of Albania except Durrës.[50]
In 1367, Albanian rulers established the [[Despotate of Arta]].
During that time, several [[Albanian principalities]] were created, notably the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)]], [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Lordship of Berat]] and [[Principality of Dukagjini]].
In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of Albania, and the [[League of Lezhë]] was held under [[Skanderbeg]] as a ruler, who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.
With the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans]].
They reached the [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [[Southern Albania]] in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431.[53][54] Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of Albania]].[55][48] The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an [[Rayah]] of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya]] among others by the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the [[Janissary]].[56] The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of [[Islamisation]] and the rapid construction of mosques.
A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the [[League of Lezhë]] until the [[Siege of Shkodra]] under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by [[Sultan]] [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]].
Skanderbeg managed to unite several of the Albanian principalities, amongst them the [[Arianiti family]], [[Dukagjini family]], [[Zaharia family]] and [[Thopia family]], and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [[Skanderbeg]].[57] The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [[Western Europe]], giving the Italian principalities more time to better prepare for the [[Siege of Otranto]].[58] However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans.[59][60]
When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[Sanjaks]].
The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]].
Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a significant proportion of the [[Ottoman military]] and bureaucracy.
Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]].[63] Enjoying this privileged position, they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen Albanian [[Grand Viziers]].
Others included members of the prominent [[Köprülü family]], [[Zagan Pasha]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] and [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]].
Furthermore, two sultans, [[Bayezid II]] and [[Mehmed III]], both had mothers of Albanian origin.[62][64][65]
The [[Albanian Renaissance]] was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [[Independent Albania]].
Modern [[Albanian culture]] flourished too, especially [[Albanian literature]] and [[Albanian art]], and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment]] principles.[67] Prior to the [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]], Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people.
The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the [[Russian-Ottoman War]] resulted the execution of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] which assigned Albanian-populated lands to their Slavic and Greek neighbours.
However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]].
From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]].
The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [[Ottoman Porte]].
They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [[League of Prizren#Formation]].[68]
Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from Bosnia, the [[Sanjakbey]] of the [[Sanjak of Prizren]] as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from [[Vilayet of Scutari]].[69] Signed by only 47 Muslim deputies, the league issued the [[Kararname (League of Prizren)]] that contained a proclamation that the people from northern Albania, [[Epirus]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are willing to defend the [[Territorial integrity]] of the Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].[70]
Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [[Abdyl Frashëri]], became focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four [[Ottoman vilayet]], including [[Kosovo Vilayet]], [[Scutari Vilayet]], [[Monastir Vilayet]] and [[Janina Vilayet]], into a unified vilayet, the [[Albanian Vilayet]].
The league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to Montenegro.
After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops, such as the [[Battle of Novšiće]], the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions.
Albania [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied by the establishment of the [[Senate of Albania]] and [[Provisional Government of Albania]] by the [[Assembly of Vlorë]] on 4 December 1912.[72][73][74][75] Its sovereignty was recognised by the [[London Conference of 1912–1913]].
On 29 July 1913, the [[Treaty of London (1913)]] delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly [[Partition (politics)]] between [[Kingdom of Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and [[Kingdom of Greece]].[76]
Headquartered in Vlorë, the [[International Commission of Control]] was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of Albania until its own political institutions were in order.[77][78] The [[International Gendarmerie]] was established as the [[Principality of Albania]]'s first law enforcement agency.
Prince of Albania [[Wilhelm of Wied]] (Princ Vilhelm Vidi) was selected as the first prince of the principality.[79] On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of [[Durrës]] and began to organise his government, appointing [[Turhan Pasha Përmeti]] to form the first Albanian cabinet.
In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war minister of Albanian origin, [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]].[80] The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six Christian [[Great Power]] and local landowners, who owned half of the arable land.[81]
In February 1914, the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] was proclaimed in [[Gjirokastër]] by the local [[Greeks in Albania]] against incorporation to Albania.
This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the Albanian Principality.[82][83] Meanwhile, the [[Peasant Revolt in Albania]] against the new regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around [[Essad Pasha Toptani]], who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam.[84][85] To gain the support of the [[Mirdita]] Catholic volunteers from northern Albania, Prince [[Wilhelm of Wied]] appointed their leader, [[Prênk Bibë Doda]], foreign minister of the Principality of Albania.
In May and June 1914, the International Gendarmerie was joined by [[Isa Boletini]] and his men, mostly from [[Kosovo]],[86] and the rebels defeated northern [[Mirdita]] Catholics, capturing most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914.[87] Prince Wied's regime collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.[88]
The [[Interwar period]] in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions.[89][90] After [[World War I]], Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence.[89] This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [[Congress of Durrës]] sought [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)]] protection but was denied, further complicating Albania's position on the international stage.
The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in [[Gusinje]] and [[Plav, Montenegro]], resulting in [[Plav–Gusinje massacres (1912–1913)]].[89][91][92] Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions.[90][93]
[[Fan Noli]], renowned for his [[Idealism]], became prime minister in 1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style constitutional government, abolish feudalism, counter Italian influence, and enhance critical sectors, including infrastructure, education and healthcare.[89] He faced resistance from former allies, who had assisted in the removal of [[Zog I of Albania]] from power, and struggled to secure foreign aid to implement his agenda.
Noli's decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an adversary of the Serbian elite, ignited allegations of [[Bolshevism]] from Belgrade.[89] This in turn led to increased pressure from Italy and culminated in Zog's restoration to authority.
In 1928, Zog transitioned Albania from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)]], with Zog assuming the title of King Zog I.
In 1939, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] launched a military invasion of Albania, resulting in the exile of Zog and the creation of an [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)]].[94][95] As [[World War II]] progressed, Italy aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including territorial claims on regions of Greece ([[Chameria]]), Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
These ambitions laid the foundation of [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)]], which aimed to unite all areas with Albanian-majority populations into a single country.[96] In 1943, as Italy's control declined, [[Nazi Germany]] assumed control of Albania, subjecting Albanians to forced labour, economic exploitation and repression under [[German occupation of Albania]].[97] The tide shifted in 1944 when Albanian partisan forces, under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] and other communist leaders, successfully liberated Albania from German occupation.[98]
The establishment of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history.[99] Hoxha's regime embraced [[Marxism–Leninism]] and implemented [[Authoritarianism]] policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights.[100] It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences.[100] Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution.[100] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality.[98] In response, Hoxha initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming Albania into an industrial society.[98] The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialisation, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative [[Hekurudha Shqiptare]], expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights.[101][102][103][104]
Albania's diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable conflicts.[89] Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Albania within its territory.[89] Subsequently, Albania established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in 1961.[89] Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to Albania's refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western support for [[Anti-communism]].
Albania's enduring partnership was with China; it sided with Beijing during the [[Sino-Soviet split]], resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
After four decades of communism paired with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order.
After the first [[Multi-party elections]] of [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1991]], the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992]] directed by the [[Democratic Party of Albania]].[107] Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [[Pyramid schemes in Albania]] that were widely supported by the government.
The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country.[108][109] Despite the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s warnings, [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.[110]
The resulting [[1997 Albanian civil unrest]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.[111]
The crisis led both [[Aleksandër Meksi]] and [[Sali Berisha]] to resign from office in the wake of the general election.
In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a U.N. peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered Albania with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international organisations.
The main international organisation involved was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[Albanian civil war of 1997#International intervention]] [[Albanian Police]] element, which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania]] and simultaneously the Albanian police.
After its [[Communist Albania]] disintegrated, Albania embarked on an active path towards [[Westernization]] with the ambition to obtain membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).[113] A notable milestone was reached in 2009, when the country attained [[Albania–NATO relations]] in NATO, marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of [[Southeast Europe]].[114][115] In adherence to its vision for further integration into the EU, it [[Accession of Albania to the European Union]] for membership on 28 April 2009.[116] Another milestone was reached on 24 June 2014, when the country was granted [[Future enlargement of the European Union]].[117]
[[Edi Rama]] of the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] won both the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2013]] and [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2017]].
As [[Prime Minister of Albania]], he implemented numerous reforms focused on [[Modernism]] the [[Economy of Albania]], as well as democratising state institutions, including the [[Judiciary of Albania]] and [[Law enforcement in Albania]].
Unemployment has steadily declined, with Albania achieving the 4th-lowest [[List of countries by unemployment rate]] in the Balkans.[118] Rama has also placed [[Gender equality]] at the centre of his agenda; since 2017 almost 50% of the ministers have been female, the largest number of women serving in the country's history.[119] During the [[2021 Albanian parliamentary election]], the ruling Socialist Party led by Rama secured its third consecutive victory, winning nearly half of votes and enough seats in parliament to govern alone.[120][121]
On 26 November 2019, a 6.4 [[Moment magnitude scale]] [[Earthquake]] ravaged Albania, with the [[Epicentre]] about 16 km (10 mi) southwest of the town of [[Mamurras]].[122] The tremor was felt in [[Tirana]] and in places as far away as [[Taranto]], Italy, and [[Belgrade]], Serbia, while the most affected areas were the coastal city of [[Durrës]] and the village of [[Kodër-Thumanë]].[123] Comprehensive response to the earthquake included substantial humanitarian aid from the [[Albanian diaspora]] and various countries [[2019 Albania earthquake#International assistance]].[124]
On 9 March 2020, [[COVID-19 pandemic in Albania]] was confirmed to have spread to Albania.[125][126] From March to June 2020, the government declared a [[State of emergency]] as a measure to limit the virus's spread.[127][128][129] The country's COVID-19 [[COVID-19 vaccination in Albania]] started on 11 January 2021, but as of 11 August 2021, the total number of vaccines administered in Albania was 1,280,239 doses.[130][131]
Albania lies along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southern Europe]] and [[Southeast Europe]], and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi).[132] It is bordered by the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west, [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the east, [[Greece]] to the south, and the [[Ionian Sea]] to the southwest.
It is between latitudes [[42nd parallel north]] and [[39th parallel north]] and longitudes [[21st meridian east]] and [[19th meridian east]].
Geographic coordinates include [[Vërmosh]] at 42° 35' 34" northern latitude as the northernmost point, [[Konispol]] at 39° 40' 0" northern latitude as the southernmost, [[Sazan Island]] at 19° 16' 50" eastern longitude as the westernmost, and [[Vërnik]] at 21° 1' 26" eastern longitude as the easternmost.[133] [[Mount Korab]], rising at 2,764 m (9,068.24 ft) [[Metres above the Adriatic]], is the highest point, while the Mediterranean Sea, at 0 m (0.00 ft), is the lowest.
The country is home to extensive mountain ranges, including the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Korab]] in the east, the [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast, the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest, and the [[Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the centre.
In the northwest is the [[Lake of Shkodër]], Southern Europe's largest lake.[134] Towards the [[Albanian Ohrid Lake Coast]] emerges the [[Lake of Ohrid]], one of the world's oldest continuously existing lakes.[135] Farther south, the expanse includes the [[Prespa Lake]] and [[Small Prespa Lake]], some of the Balkans' highest lakes.
The country's longest river, measured from mouth to source, is the [[Drin River]], which starts at the confluence of its two headwaters, the [[Black Drin]] and [[White Drin]].
Of particular concern is the [[Vjosë]], one of Europe's last intact large river systems.
In Albania [[Forest cover]] is around 29.% of the total land area, equivalent to 788,900 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 788,800 hectares (ha) in 1990.
Of the naturally regenerating forest 11% was reported to be [[Primary forest]] (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas.
For the year 2015, 97% of the forest area was reported to be under [[State ownership]], 3% [[Private property]] and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown.[136][137]
The [[Climate of Albania]] exhibits a distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences in latitude, longitude and altitude.[138][139] Albania experiences a [[Mediterranean climate]] and [[Continental climate]], characterised by the presence of four distinct seasons.[140] According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Albania encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from Mediterranean and [[Humid subtropical climate]] in the western half to [[Oceanic climate]], [[Humid continental climate]] and [[Subarctic climate]] in the eastern half of the country.[141] The coastal regions along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] in Albania are acknowledged as the warmest areas, while the northern and eastern regions encompassing the [[Albanian Alps]] and the [[Korab Mountains]] are recognised as the coldest areas in the country.[142] Throughout the year, the average monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from −1 [[Celsius]] (30 [[Fahrenheit]]) during the winter months to 21.8 °C (71.2 °F) in the summer months.
Notably, the highest recorded temperature of 43.9 °C (111.0 °F) was observed in [[Kuçovë]] on 18 July 1973, while the lowest temperature of −29 °C (−20 °F) was recorded in Shtyllë, [[Librazhd]] on 9 January 2017.[143][144]
Albania receives most of the [[Precipitation (meteorology)]] in winter months and less in summer months.[139] The average precipitation is about 1,485 millimetres (58.5 inches).[142] The mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 3,000 millimetres (24 and 118 inches) depending on geographical location.[140] The [[Northern Mountain Range (Albania)]] and [[Southern Mountain Range (Albania)]] receive the intenser amount of precipitation, whilst the [[Northern Mountain Range (Albania)]] and [[Southern Mountain Range (Albania)]] as well as the [[Western Lowlands]] the more limited amount.[142] The [[Albanian Alps]] in the far north of the country are considered to be among the most humid regions of Europe, receiving at least 3,100 mm (122.0 in) of rain annually.[142] Four [[Glacier]] within these mountains were discovered at a relatively low altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft), which is extremely rare for such a southerly latitude.[145]
A [[Biodiversity hotspot]], Albania possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting [[Biodiversity]] on account of its geographical location at the centre of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the great diversity in its [[Climatic]], geological and [[Hydrological]] conditions.[146][147] Because of remoteness, the mountains and hills of Albania are endowed with forests, trees and grasses that are essential to the lives for a wide variety of animals, among others for two of the most [[Endangered species]] of the country, the [[Balkan lynx]] and [[Brown bear]], as well as the [[Wildcat]], [[Grey wolf]], [[Red fox]], [[Golden jackal]], [[Egyptian vulture]] and [[Golden eagle]], the latter constituting the national animal of the country.[148][149][150][151]
The estuaries, wetlands and lakes are extraordinarily important for the [[Greater flamingo]], [[Pygmy cormorant]] and the extremely rare and perhaps the most iconic bird of the country, the [[Dalmatian pelican]].[152] Of particular importance are the [[Mediterranean monk seal]], [[Loggerhead sea turtle]] and [[Green sea turtle]] that use to nest on the country's coastal waters and shores.
In terms of [[Phytogeography]], Albania is part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and stretches specifically within the [[Illyria]] province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and [[Mediterranean Basin]].
Its territory can be subdivided into four terrestrial [[Ecoregion]] of the [[Palearctic realm]] namely within the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]].[153][154]
Approximately 3,500 different species of plants can be found in Albania which refers principally to a [[Mediterranean]] and [[Eurasia]] character.
At the minimum 300 plants growing locally are used in the preparation of herbs and medicines.[155] The trees within the forests are primarily [[Fir]], [[Oak]], [[Beech]] and [[Pine]].
Since 1994, the country is a party to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and its associated [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] and [[Nagoya Protocol]].[156] To uphold these commitments, it has developed and implemented a comprehensive [[Biodiversity action plan]] (NBSAP).[156] Furthermore, Albania has established a partnership with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and international scales.
Guided by the IUCN, the country has made substantial progress in the foundation of [[Protected area]] within its boundaries, encompassing 12 [[National park]] among others [[Butrint National Park]], [[Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park]], [[Llogara National Park]], [[Prespa National Park (Albania)]] and [[Vjosa Wild River National Park]].[157]
As a signatory to the [[Ramsar Convention]], Albania has granted special recognition upon four wetlands, designating them as Wetlands of International Importance, including [[Buna (Adriatic Sea)]]-[[Lake Skadar]], [[Butrint Lagoon]], [[Karavasta Lagoon]] and [[Lake Prespa]].[158] The country's dedication to protection extends further into the sphere of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]], operating within the framework of the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]], evidenced by its engagement in the [[Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve]].[159][160] Furthermore, Albania is host to two natural [[World Heritage Site]], which encompass the Ohrid region and both the [[Gashi River]] and [[Rrajce]] as part of [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]].[161]
The [[Protected areas of Albania]] are areas designated and managed by the [[Albanian government]].
There are 12 [[National park]], 4 [[Ramsar site]], 1 [[Biosphere reserve]] and 786 other types of conservation reserves in Albania.[157][162] Located in the north, the Albanian Alps National Park, comprising the former [[Theth National Park]] and [[Valbonë Valley National Park]], is surrounded amidst the towering peaks of the [[Accursed Mountains]].
In the east, portions of the rugged [[Korab]], [[Nemërçka]] and [[Shebenik]] Mountains are conserved within the boundaries of [[Fir of Hotovë-Dangëlli National Park]], [[Shebenik National Park]] and [[Prespa National Park (Albania)]], with the latter encompassing Albania's share of the [[Prespa Lake]] and [[Small Prespa Lake]].
To the south, the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] define the [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]], shaping the landscape of [[Llogara National Park]], which extends into the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania]], forming the [[Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park]].
Further southward lies [[Butrint National Park]], occupying a peninsula surrounded by the Lake of Butrint and the [[Channel of Vivari]].
In the west, stretching along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]], the [[Divjakë-Karavasta National Park]] boasts the extensive [[Lagoon of Karavasta]], one of the largest lagoon systems in the Mediterranean Sea.
Notably, Europe's first wild river national park, [[Vjosa Wild River National Park]], safeguards the [[Vjosa]] and its primary tributaries, which originates in the [[Pindus]] Mountains and flows to the Adriatic Sea.
[[Dajti Mountain National Park]], [[Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park]] and [[Tomorr Mountain National Park]] protect the mountainous terrain of the centre of Albania, including the [[Tomorr]] and [[Skanderbeg Mountains]].
Environmental issues in Albania notably encompass [[Air pollution]] and [[Water pollution]], [[Climate change in Albania]] impacts, [[Waste management]] shortcomings, [[Conservation biology]] and imperative for [[Nature conservation]].[163][164]
Climate change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality of life in Albania.[165] Albania is one of the European countries most at risk and vulnerable to [[Natural disaster]].[166] Natural disasters, such as [[Flood]], [[Wildfire]], and [[Landslide]], are increasing in Albania due to climate change, causing significant damage.[167][168] Rising sea levels are anticipated to negatively impact coastal communities and the tourism industry.[169]
In 2023 Albania emitted 7.67 million tonnes of [[Greenhouse gas]],[170] equivalent to 2.73 tonnes per person,[171] making it a relatively low emitting country.
Albania has pledged a 20.9% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, and [[Net-zero emissions]] by 2050.[172]
The country has a moderate and improving performance in the [[Environmental Performance Index]] with an overall ranking of 62 out of 180 countries in 2022.[173] However, Albania's ranking has decreased since its highest placement at position 15 in the Environmental Performance Index of 2012.[174]
Since declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a significant political transformation, traversing through distinct periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the eventual establishment of a democratic order.[175] In 1998, Albania transitioned into a [[Sovereign state]] [[Parliamentary republic]] [[Constitutional republic]], marking a fundamental milestone in its political evolution.[176] Its governance structure operates under a [[Constitution of Albania]] that serves as the principal document of the country.[177] The constitution is grounded in the principle of the [[Separation of powers]], with three arms of government that encompass the legislative embodied in the [[Parliament of Albania]], the executive led by the [[President of Albania]] as the ceremonial [[Head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] as the functional [[Head of government]], and the judiciary with a hierarchy of courts, including the [[Constitutional Court of Albania]] and [[Supreme Court of Albania]] as well as multiple [[Appeals courts of Albania]] and [[Administrative Courts in Albania]].[176]
Emerging from decades of isolation following the fall of communism, Albania has adopted a [[Foreign relations of Albania]] orientation centred on active cooperation and engagement in international affairs.
At the core of Albania's foreign policies lie a set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic ties with other countries, advocating for [[International recognition of Kosovo]], addressing the concerns related to the [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians]], pursuing Euro-Atlantic integration and protecting the rights of the Albanians in [[Albanians in Kosovo]], [[Albanians in greece]], [[Arbëreshë people]], [[Albanians in Montenegro]], [[Albanians in Macedonia]], [[Albanians in south Serbia]] and the [[Albanian diaspora]].[181]
The external affairs of Albania underscore the country's dedication to regional stability and integration into major international institutions.[182] Albania became a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) in 1955, shortly after emerging from a period of isolation during the communist era.[183] The country reached a major achievement in its foreign policy by securing NATO membership in 2009.[184][185] Since obtaining candidate status in 2014, the country has also embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda to align itself with European Union (EU) accession standards, with the objective of becoming an EU member state.[117]
Albania and Kosovo maintain a fraternal relationship strengthened by their substantial cultural, ethnical and historical ties.[186] Both countries foster enduring diplomatic ties, with Albania actively supporting Kosovo's development and international integration efforts.[186] Its fundamental contribution to [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] is underscored by its early [[International recognition of Kosovo]] in 2008.[187] Furthermore, both governments hold annual joint meetings, displayed by the inaugural meeting in 2014, which serves as an official platform to enhance bilateral cooperation and reinforce their joint commitment to policies that promote the stability and prosperity of the broader Albanian region.[186]
The [[Albanian Armed Forces]] consist of [[Albanian Land Force]], [[Albanian Air Force]] and [[Albanian Naval Force]] and constitute the military and paramilitary forces of the country.
They are led by a [[Commander-in-chief]] under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)]] and by the [[President of Albania]] as the supreme commander during wartime.
However, in times of peace its powers are executed through the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)]].[188]
The chief purpose of the armed forces of Albania is the defence of the independence, the [[Sovereignty]] and the [[Territorial integrity]] of the country, as well as the participation in humanitarian, combat, non-combat and peace support operations.[188] [[Military service]] is voluntary since 2010 with the age of 19 being the legal minimum age for the duty.[189][190]
Albania has committed to increase the participations in multinational operations.[191] Since the fall of communism, the country has participated in six international missions but only one United Nations mission in [[UNOMIG]], where it sent three military observers.
Since February 2008, Albania has participated officially in NATO's [[Operation Active Endeavor]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].[192] It was invited to join NATO on 3 April 2008, and it became a full member on 2 April 2009.[193]
Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for [[NATO]] integration.
In 2015, the association [[ILGA-Europe]] ranked Albania 19th in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries.[198] On the latest report in 2022, lack of progress caused Albania to be ranked the 28th country in Europe, among 49 countries observed.[199]
Albania is defined within a territorial area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].
It is informally divided into three regions, the [[Northern Albania]], [[Central Albania]] and [[Southern Albania]].
Since [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912, Albania has reformed [[Administrative divisions of Albania#History]] 21 times.
Presently, the primary [[Administrative divisions of Albania]] are the twelve constituent [[Counties of Albania]] (qarqe/qarqet), which hold equal status under the law.[200] Counties had previously been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the 36 [[Districts of Albania]] (rrathë/rrathët) of that time.[201][202] The largest county in Albania by population is [[Tirana County]] with over 800,000 people.
The smallest county, by population, is [[Gjirokastër County]] with over 70,000 people.
The largest county, by area, is [[Korçë County]] encompassing 3,711 square kilometres (1,433 sq mi) of the southeast of Albania.
The smallest county, by area, is [[Durrës County]] with an area of 766 square kilometres (296 sq mi) in the west of Albania.
The counties are made up of 61 second-level divisions known as [[Municipalities of Albania]] (bashki/bashkia).[203] The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and [[Law enforcement in Albania]].[204][205][206] They unified and simplified the previous system of [[Urban municipalities of Albania]] and [[Rural municipalities of Albania]] or [[Communes of Albania]] (komuna/komunat) in 2015.[207][208] For smaller issues of [[Local government]], the municipalities are organised into 373 [[Administrative units of Albania]] (njësia/njësitë administrative).
Transitioning from a [[Socialism]] [[Planned economy]] to a [[Capitalism]] [[Mixed economy]], Albania is classified as a [[Developing country]] [[Open market]] with an [[List of countries by GNI (nominal, Atlas method) per capita#Upper-middle-income group]] status.[212][213] The [[Economy of Albania]] is characterised by a substantial [[Tertiary sector of the economy]], comprising 48.6% of GDP, with key contributions from wholesale and retail trade, [[Tourism in Albania]], real estate, and logistics.[214] Following this, the [[Secondary sector of the economy]] accounts for 20.2%, particularly influenced by construction, while the [[Primary sector of the economy]], including forestry, and fisheries, represents 18.5%, and the [[Secondary sector of the economy]] contributes a modest 6.3% to the economy.[214] As of 2025, Albania's nominal [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) is reported at $26.911 billion with a [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP]] of $9,474.[215] The projected annual percentage change in economic growth for 2025 is 3.8%, with a forecasted moderation to 3.5% by 2029.[216]
The [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] (SAA) with the European Union (EU), signed in 2006, is one of the most significant.[217] This agreement provides critical trade benefits and serves as a foundation for the Albanian integration into the EU.
In 2009, Albania signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), which further expands trade opportunities and market access.[218] The country is also a signatory to the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) and [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] (BSEC), promoting regional trade and collaboration with neighboring countries.[219][220] Fruthermore, the country has enhanced its bilateral trade relations through a FTA with Turkey, the United Kingdom and a bilateral investment treaty with the United States.[221][222]
The 2023 [[Economic Freedom of the World]] report placed Albania in the 31st position, noting a considerable degree of economic independence and the effective adoption of market-oriented policies.[223] The 2024 [[Bertelsmann Transformation Index]] ranked Albania 20th and acknowledged substantial progress in political and economic transformation.[224] Also in 2024, the country was positioned 23rd in the [[Global Gender Gap Report]], excelling in the Economic Participation and Opportunity category with a global ranking of 16th, showcasing significant advancements in women's economic participation.[225] However, the Albanian economy, despite demonstrating considerable resilience, encounters substantial vulnerabilities that hinder its development.[226] Principal challenges include widespread corruption, distorted competition, and frequent modifications to fiscal legislation.[226] Furthermore, inadequate contract enforcement, a large informal sector, and persistent labor shortages further complicate the national economic progress.[224][226]
Economic landscape of Albania is characterised by regional disparities, particularly apparent in the concentration of economic activities in the triangular region formed by [[Tirana]], [[Durrës]] and [[Laç]].[227] This metropolitan area, referred to as Durana, functions as the principal economic center of Albania.[228][229] In the year 2021, [[Tirana County]] accounted for a significant 44% of the national GDP, with the counties of [[Fier County]] and [[Durrës County]] also playing integral roles in the economy, contributing 11% and 10% to the GDP, respectively.[230] Other substantial economic centers, such as [[Elbasan]] and the coastal cities of [[Sarandë]] and [[Vlorë]], highlight the uneven distribution of economic development across the country.[231] Cultural regions, including [[Berat]] and [[Korçë]], despite their geographical distance from the primary economic hubs, have derived considerable benefits from the expansion of the tourism sector.[232]
Albania produces significant amounts of fruits (apples, [[Olive]], grapes, oranges, lemons, [[Apricot]], [[Peach]], [[Cherry]], [[Figs]], [[Prunus cerasus]], [[Plum]], and [[Strawberry]]), [[Vegetable oil]] (potatoes, tomatoes, [[Maize]], onions, and wheat), [[Sugar beet]], tobacco, meat, [[Honey]], [[Dairy product]], traditional medicine and [[Essential oil]].
Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of [[Salvia]], [[Rosemary]] and [[Gentiana lutea]].[233] The country's proximity to the [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] give the underdeveloped fishing industry great potential.
The [[World Bank]] and [[European Community]] economists report that, Albania's fishing industry has good potential to generate export earnings because prices in the nearby Greek and Italian markets are many times higher than those in the Albanian market.
The fish available off the coasts of the country are [[Carp]], [[Trout]], [[Sea bream]], [[Mussel]] and [[Crustacean]].
Albania has one of Europe's longest histories of [[Viticulture]].[234] Today's region was one of the few places where vine was naturally grown during the ice age.
It is very diversified, from [[Electronics industry]], [[Manufacturing industries]],[237] [[Textile industry]], to [[Food industry]], [[Cement industry]], [[Mining industry]],[238] and [[Energy industry]].
The [[Antea Cement]] plant in [[Fushë-Krujë]] is considered one of the nation's largest industrial greenfield investments.[239] Albanian oil and gas is one of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated, sectors of its economy.
Albania has the [[List of countries by proven oil reserves]] in the [[Balkan peninsula]] after [[Romania]], and the largest [[Patos-Marinza Oil Field]][240] in Europe.
The [[Albpetrol]] company is owned by the Albanian state and monitors the state petroleum agreements in the country.
The textile industry has seen an extensive expansion by approaching companies from the [[European Union]] (EU) in Albania.
According to the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)]], as of 2016[update], textile production had an annual growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion euros.[241]
Albania is a significant minerals producer and ranks among the world's leading [[Chromium]] producers and exporters.[242] The nation is also a notable producer of copper, nickel, and coal.[243] The [[Batra mine]], [[Bulqizë mine]], and [[Thekna mine]] are among the most recognised Albanian mines still in operation.
The [[Tertiary sector]] represents the fastest growing sector of the country's economy.
36% of the population work in the service sector which contributes to 65% of the country's GDP.[244] Ever since the end of the 20th century, the [[Banking industry]] is a major component of the tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to [[Privatisation]] and the commendable [[Monetary policy]].[245][244]
Previously one of the most [[Isolationism]] and controlled countries in the world, [[Telecommunication industry]] represents nowadays another major contributor to the sector.
It developed largely through privatisation and subsequent investment by both domestic and foreign investors.[244] [[Eagle Mobile]], [[Vodafone Albania]] and [[Telekom Albania]] are the leading [[Telecommunications service provider]] in the country.
According to the [[UN Tourism]] (UN Tourism), Albania welcomed approximately 11.7 million tourists in 2024, marking a significant increase from previous years.[250]
The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the [[Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]] in the west of the country.
But the [[Albanian Riviera]] in the southwest has the most scenic and pristine beaches; its coastline has a considerable length of 446 kilometres (277 miles).[251] The coast has a distinctive character, rich in varieties of virgin beaches, capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves, and many landforms.
Some parts of this seaside are very clean ecologically, including unexplored areas, which are very rare within the [[Mediterranean]].[252] Other attractions include the mountainous areas such as the [[Albanian Alps]], [[Ceraunian Mountains]] and [[Korab]] Mountains but also the historical cities of [[Berat]], [[Durrës]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Sarandë]], [[Shkodër]] and [[Korçë]].
Transportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (Albania)]] and entities such as the [[Albanian Road Authority]] (ARRSH), responsible for the construction and maintenance of the [[Highways in Albania]] and [[Motorways in Albania]] in Albania, as well as the [[Civil Aviation Authority (Albania)]] (AAC), with the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and airports in the country.
The [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]] of [[Tirana]] is the premier air gateway to the country, and is also the principal hub for Albania's national [[Flag carrier]] airline, [[Air Albania]].
The airport carried more than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 with connections to many destinations in other countries around [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].[253] The country plans to progressively increase the number of airports especially in the south with possible locations in [[Sarandë]], [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Vlorë International Airport]].[254]
The [[Highways in Albania]] and [[Motorways in Albania]] are properly maintained and often still under construction and renovation.
The [[A1 motorway (Albania)]] (A1) is an integral transportation corridor and the country's longest motorway.
It is planned to link [[Durrës]] on the Adriatic Sea across [[Pristina]] in Kosovo with the [[Pan-European Corridor X]] in Serbia.[255][256] The [[A2 motorway (Albania)]] (A2) is part of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]] as well as the [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]] and connects [[Fier]] with [[Vlorë]].[255] The [[A3 motorway (Albania)]] (A3) is under construction and after its completion will connect [[Tirana]] and [[Elbasan]] with the Pan-European Corridor VIII.
[[Port of Durrës]] is the busiest and largest [[Seaport]] in the country, followed by [[Port of Vlorë]], [[Port of Shëngjin]] and [[Port of Sarandë]].
The rail network is administered by the national railway company [[Hekurudha Shqiptare]].
Due to its location and natural resources, Albania has a wide variety of [[Energy resource]], ranging from gas, oil, and coal to [[Wind energy]], [[Solar energy]], [[Hydropower]], and other [[Renewable energy]] sources.[259][260] According to the [[World Economic Forum]]'s 2023 Energy Transition Index (ETI), the country ranked 21st globally, highlighting the progress in its energy transition agenda.[261] Currently, Albania's electricity generation sector depends on [[Hydroelectricity]], ranking fifth in the world in percentage terms.[262][263][264] Increasing risks of river floods and droughts due to [[Climate change]] is expected to put electricity generation at risk.[265] The [[Drin (river)]], in the north, hosts four [[Hydroelectric power station]], including [[Fierza Hydroelectric Power Station]], [[Koman Hydroelectric Power Station]], [[Skavica Hydro Power Plant]] and [[Vau i Dejës Hydroelectric Power Station]].
Two other power stations, such as the [[Banjë Hydro Power Plant]] and [[Moglicë Hydro Power Plant]], are along the [[Devoll (river)]] in the south.[266]
It has the 10th-largest oil reserves in Europe and the 58th in the world.[267] The country's main petroleum deposits are located around the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] and [[Myzeqe]] Plain within the [[Western Lowlands]], where the country's largest reserve is located.
[[Patos-Marinza Oil Field]], also located within the area, is the largest onshore [[Oil field]] in Europe.[268] The [[Trans Adriatic Pipeline]] (TAP), part of the planned [[Southern Gas Corridor]], runs for 215 kilometres (134 miles) across Albania's territory before entering the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] approximately 17 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of [[Fier]].[269]
Albania's [[Water resources]] are particularly abundant in all the regions of the country and comprise [[Lakes of Albania]], [[Rivers of Albania]], springs, and groundwater aquifers.[270] The country's available average quantity of [[Fresh water]] is estimated at 129.7 cubic metres (4,580 cubic feet) per inhabitant per year, one of the highest rates in Europe.[271] According to data presented by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) in 2015, about 93% of the country's total population had access to [[Improved sanitation]].[272]
The [[Freedom of press]] and [[Freedom of speech]], and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Albania]].[273] Albania was ranked 84th on the [[Press Freedom Index]] of 2020 compiled by the [[Reporters Without Borders]], with its score steadily declining since 2003.[274] Nevertheless, in the 2020 report of [[Freedom in the World]], the [[Freedom House]] classified the freedoms of press and speech in Albania as partly free from political interference and manipulation.[275]
[[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar]] (RTSH) is the [[National broadcaster]] corporation of Albania operating numerous television and radio stations in the country.[276] The three major private broadcaster corporations are [[Top Channel]], [[TV Klan]] and [[Vizion Plus]] whose content are distributed throughout Albania and beyond its territory in [[Kosovo]] and other [[Albanian language]] territories.
Albanian cinema has its roots in the 20th century and developed after the country's [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]].[277] The first [[Movie theater]] exclusively devoted to showing [[Motion pictures]] was built in 1912 in [[Shkodër]].[277] During the [[People's Republic of Albania]], Albanian cinema developed rapidly with the inauguration of the [[Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re]] in Tirana.[277] In 1953, the Albanian-Soviet [[Epic film]], the [[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]], was released chronicling the life and fight of the medieval Albanian hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg]].
It went on to win the international prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]].
In 2003, the [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established, the largest film festival in the country.
The [[Durrës Amphitheatre]] is host to the [[Durrës International Film Festival]], the second largest film festival.
After the [[Fall of communism in Albania]] in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have drastically decreased.
As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005 approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have left Albania.[278] Albania was ranked 67th in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2025.[279][280]"Albania ranking in the Global Innovation Index 2025".
Telecommunication represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic sectors in Albania.[281][282] [[Vodafone Albania]], [[Telekom Albania]] and [[Albtelecom]] are the three large providers of [[Mobile network operator]] and [[Internet]] in Albania.[281] As of the [[Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (Albania)]] (AKEP) in 2018, the country had approximately 2.7 million active mobile users with almost 1.8 million active broadband subscribers.[283] Vodafone Albania alone served more than 931,000 mobile users, Telekom Albania had about 605,000 users and Albtelecom had more than 272,000 users.[283] In [[List of spaceflight launches in January–June 2023]], Albania launched its [[List of first satellites by country]], Albania 1 and Albania 2, into [[Orbit]], in what was regarded as a milestone effort in monitoring the country's territory and identifying illegal activities.[284][285] Albanian-American engineer [[Mira Murati]], the Chief Technology Officer of research organisation [[OpenAI]], played a substantial role in the development and launch of artificial intelligence services such as [[ChatGPT]], [[OpenAI Codex]] and [[DALL-E]].[286][287][288] In December 2023, Prime Minister Edi Rama announced plans for collaboration between the Albanian government and ChatGPT, facilitated by discussions with Murati.[289][290] Rama emphasised the intention to streamline the alignment of Albanian laws with the regulations of the European Union, aiming to reduce costs associated with translation and legal services.[289]
The demographic statistics of Albania, as revealed by the 2023 census conducted by the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)]] (INSTAT), indicated a population of 2,402,113, with a notable decline from the 2,821,977 recorded in the 2011 census.[3][291] The decrease in inhabitants began after the disintegration of the communist regime in Albania and is associated with significant shifts within the political, economic, and social structure of Albania.[292][293] A principal factor in this transition incorporates a decline in fertility rates coupled with an increase in emigration, both contributing to persistent demographic changes and challenges.[294] It is forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least, depending on the actual rates and the level of migration.[295] Currently, the population density of Albania is measured at 83.6 inhabitants per square kilometer with a varied distribution of inhabitants across different regions.[3][296] The counties of [[Tirana County]] and [[Durrës County]] showcase substantial concentrations of people, accounting for about 41% of the overall demographic of Albania, with 32% residing in Tirana and 9% in Durrës.[297] Conversely, more peripheral and rural counties such as [[Gjirokastër County]] and [[Kukës County]] present significantly lower population densities, with each aiding 3% to the overall population.[297]
The [[Albanian diaspora]] has been formed since the late Middle Ages, when they emigrated to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest of Albania.[298] Following the fall of communism, large numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Albanian [[Minority group]] are present in the neighbouring territories such as the west of North Macedonia, the southeast of Montenegro, Kosovo in its entirety and parts of southern Serbia.
Subsequent to the collapse of communism in 1991, Albania has undergone a remarkable transformation in its urban landscape, emerging as one of the fastest urbanising countries in Europe.[302][303][304] At the forefront of this transformation is the [[Tirana County]]-[[Durrës County]] agglomeration, a densely populated urban corridor situated along the [[Albanian Coastal Lowlands]].[305] This corridor has become the primary locus of population growth and settlement development, attracting a significant influx of internal migrants from the country's peripheral areas.[305] Despite an overall decline of the country's total population, the proportion of the urban demographic has consistently progressed from 47% in 2001 to 65% in 2023.[293][306][307] This sustained increase, coupled with the concentration in the Tirana-Durrës region, has led to a spread of regional imbalances, with the peripheral areas, particularly [[Dibër County]] and [[Kukës County]], experiencing severe depopulation.[308][309][297]
The [[Official language]] of the country is [[Albanian language]] which is spoken by the vast majority of the country's population.[322] Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, [[Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian]], though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect.
The [[Shkumbin]] river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.
Among minority languages, [[Greek language]] is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language, mainly in the country's south where its speakers are concentrated.[323][324][325][326] Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include [[Aromanian language]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Macedonian language]], [[Bulgarian language]], [[Gora dialect]], and [[Romani language]].[327] Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania.
In the mid-2010s, an increasing number of Albanians showed interest in learning the [[German language]],[329] which has been explained as part of "a Western Balkan trend of preparing to integrate into the German labor market".[330] Some of them have gone to [[Germany]] for studies or work.
Albania and Germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries know both cultures better.[331] Due to a sharp rise in economic relations with [[Turkey]], interest in learning [[Turkish language]], in particular among young people, was also growing on a yearly basis in the 2010s.[332]
Designated national and cultural minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma, Egyptian, Bosnian and Bulgarian peoples, as well as Gorani and Jews as other minority groups.[334][335] The 2023 census recorded the ethnic composition as [[Albanians]] 2,186,917 (91,04% of the total), [[Greeks in Albania]] 23,485 (0,98%), [[Macedonians of Albania]] 2,281 (0,09%), [[Montenegrins of Albania]] 511 (0,02%), [[Aromanians in Albania]] 2,459 (0,1%), [[Romani people in Albania]] 9,813 (0.4%), [[Balkan Egyptians]] 12,375 (0,5%), [[Bosniaks in Albania]] 2,963 (0,12%), [[Serbs and Montenegrins in Albania]] 584 (0,02%), [[Bulgarians in Albania]] 7,057 (0,29%), mixed ethnicities 770 (0.03%), other ethnicities 3,798 (0.15%), and 134,451 (5.60%) with unspecified ethnicity, out of a total population of 2,402,113.[333]
Albania is a [[Secular state]] and religiously diverse country with no [[Official religion]].
[[Freedom of religion]], [[Freedom of belief]] and [[Freedom of conscience]] are guaranteed under the country's [[Constitution of Albania]].[336] As of the 2023 Census, there were 1,101,718 (45.86%) [[Sunni Islam]], 201,530 (8.38%) [[Roman Catholicism]], 173,645 (7.22%) [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], 115,644 (4.81%) [[Bektashi Order]], 9,658 (0.4%) [[Evangelicalism]], 3,670 (0.15%) of other religions, 332,155 (13.82%) believers without religion or denomination, 85,311 (3.55%) Atheists and 378,782 (15.76%) did not provide an answer.[2] Albania is nevertheless ranked among the least religious countries in the world.[337] Religion constitute an important role in the lives of only 39% of the country's population.[338] In another report, 56% considered themselves religious, 30% considered themselves non-religious, while 9% defined themselves as convinced atheists.
The [[Islam in Albania]] are spread throughout the country.
[[Orthodoxy in Albania]] and [[Bektashi]] are mostly found in the south, whereas [[Catholicism in Albania]] mainly live in the north.[340] In 2008, there were 694 [[Catholic]] churches and 425 [[Albanian Orthodox Church]] churches, 568 mosques and 70 [[Bektashi Order]] [[Takya]] in the country.[341][342]
During [[Modern history]], the Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life.
The country has never had an [[Official religion]] either as a republic or as a kingdom.
The [[Communism in Albania]] persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[Anti-religious]].
The country was then officially declared to be the world's first [[Atheist state]].
Religious freedom has returned, however, since the [[Fall of communism in Albania]].
Islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as a practised religion in Albania.[343] Some smaller Christian sects in Albania include [[Evangelicalism]] and several [[Protestant]] communities including [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].[344][345][346][347] The first recorded Protestant of Albania was Said Toptani, who travelled around Europe and returned to [[Tirana]] in 1853, where he preached [[Protestantism]].
The first [[Evangelical Protestants]] appeared in the 19th century and the Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1892.
Following mass emigration to Israel after the fall of communism, there are only 200 Albanian [[Judaism in Albania]] left in the country.[348][349]
In Albania, education is secular, free, [[Compulsory education]], and based on three levels.[350][351] The academic year is apportioned into two semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July.
[[Albanian language]] is the [[Primary language]] of instruction in the country's [[State school]].[351] The study of a first [[Foreign language]] is mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools.[352] Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German.[352] Albania has a [[School life expectancy]] of 16 years and a [[Literacy rate]] of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women.[353][354]
Tertiary education is optional and has undergone a thorough reformation and restructuring in compliance with the principles of the [[Bologna Process]].
There are a significant number of private and public [[Institutions of higher education]] in Albania's major cities.[355][351] Tertiary education is organised into three successive levels, the [[Bachelor's degree]], [[Master's degree]], and [[Doctorate Degree]].
The [[Constitution of Albania]] guarantees its citizens equal, free, and [[Universal health care]].[357] The health care system is organised into [[Primary healthcare]], [[Secondary care]], and [[Tertiary healthcare]], and is in a process of modernisation and development.[358][359] The [[Life expectancy]] at birth in Albania is 77.8 years, ranking [[List of countries by life expectancy]] in the world and surpassing several [[Developed countries]].[360] The average [[Life expectancy#Healthy life expectancy]] is 68.8 years, ranking 37th in the world.[361] The country's [[Infant mortality rate]] was estimated at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015.
In 2000, the country had the world's 55th-best healthcare performance, as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).[362]
[[Cardiovascular disease]] is the principal cause of death in Albania, accounting for 52% of deaths.[358] [[Accident]], injuries, [[Malignant disease]] and [[Respiratory disease]] are other primary causes of death.[358] [[Neuropsychiatric disorders]] has also increased due to recent demographic, social, and economic changes in the country.[358]
In 2009, Albania had a fruit and vegetable supply of 886 grams per capita per day, the fifth-highest supply in Europe.[363] Compared to other developed and developing countries, Albania has a relatively low rate of [[Obesity]], probably thanks to the [[Mediterranean diet]].[364][365] According to [[List of countries by Body Mass Index (BMI)#WHO Data on Prevalence of Obesity (BMI above 30) (2014)]], 21.7% of adults in the country are clinically [[Overweight]], with a [[Body mass index]] (BMI) score of 25 or more.[366]
The red and black [[National colours]] are displayed on the [[Flag of Albania]] that is adorned with a [[Double-headed eagle]] as the foremost recognised [[National symbols of Albania]].[367][368][369] With the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people.[367] The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero [[Skanderbeg]], renowned as Skanderbeg, who led a prosperous [[Skanderbeg's rebellion]] against Ottoman rule.[370][371][369] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it emerged as a [[Albanian heraldry]] [[Armorial of Albania]] in the [[Principality of Arbanon]] and among notable Albanian dynasties such as the [[Dukagjini family]], [[Kastrioti family]], [[Muzaka family]] and [[Thopia family]] clans.[372] Amid the [[Albanian National Awakening]], marking the resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence.[368] Its importance reached its culmination with [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912, when [[Ismail Qemali]] raised it as the national flag in [[Vlorë]].[368]
The [[Coat of arms of Albania]] is an adaptation of the flag of Albania and the seal of Skanderbeg.[367] The coat comprises the black double-headed eagle positioned at the centre of a red field.[367] Above the eagle, it carries the [[Arms of Skanderbeg]] that is crowned with the head of a golden horned goat.[369] [[Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar]], which translates to "You Albania, give me honour, give me the name Albanian", is the [[List of national mottos]].[368][369] It finds its foundation in the legacy of [[National poet]] [[Naim Frashëri]], who held a renowned role during the Albanian Renaissance.[368] The [[National anthem]], "[[Himni i Flamurit]]", was composed by [[Aleksandër Stavre Drenova]] and adopted as such following Albania's independence in 1912.[367]
[[Albanian national clothing]], with its contrasting variations for the northern [[Ghegs]] and southern [[Tosks]], is a testament to Albania's history, cultural diversity and ethnic identity.[373] Gheg men wear a light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers referred to as the Tirq.
An integral component of their costume is the [[Xhamadan]], a woolen red velvet vest adorned with folkloric motifs and gold patterns.[374] They also wear a distinctive dome-shaped hat known as the [[Qeleshe]], crafted from wool, with its origins tracing back to the [[Illyrians]].[375][376] Conversely, Tosk men opt for the [[Fustanella]], a knee-length garment designated as the national costume, typically white with pleats, accompanied by a white shirt.
To complete their attire, men wear knee-high socks referred to as [[Çorape]] and leather shoes known as [[Opinga]].
Integral to the traditional attire of Gheg women is the ancient [[Xhubleta]].[373] Dedicated efforts have been undertaken to preserve and promote the dress, acknowledging its significance as an emblem of Albanian heritage.[377] As a testament to its importance, the Xhubleta has been inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].[377] The distinctive bell-shaped garment is fashioned in black and enriched with embroidered ethnic Albanian motifs, showcasing the remarkable craftsmanship of northern Albania.[373] Its crafting process involves multiple intricate stages, encompassing the preparation of shajak fabric and the precise cutting techniques.[377]
The [[Albanian art]] of Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval [[Civilisation]], traditions and religions.
It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting, [[Pottery]], sculpture, [[Ceramic]] and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions and period.
The rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was accompanied by a corresponding growth in [[Christian art]] and [[Islamic art]] in the lands of Albania which are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country.[378] Centuries later, the [[Albanian Renaissance]] proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and art whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of [[Impressionism]] and [[Romanticism (art)]].[379] However, [[Onufri]], [[Kolë Idromeno]], [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]] are the most eminent representatives of Albanian art.
The [[Architecture of Albania]] reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the [[Classical antiquity]].
Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [[Architectural style]].
In the 20th century, many historical as well as [[Sacred architecture]] buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [[Communism in Albania]].[380]
[[Ancient architecture]] is found throughout Albania and most visible in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)]], [[Butrint]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)]], [[Rozafa Castle]] and [[Durrës Amphitheatre]].
Considering the long period of rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]], they introduced castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible [[Mural]] and [[Fresco]].
Perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of [[Korçë]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopojë]] and [[Gjirokastër]].
Involving the introduction of [[Ottoman architecture]] there was a development of mosques and other Islamic buildings, particularly seen in Berat and Gjirokastër.
A productive period of [[Historicism (art)]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neoclassicism]] merged into the 19th century, best exemplified in [[Korçë]].
The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern [[Italianate architecture]], which is present in [[Tirana]] such as the [[Skanderbeg Square]] and Ministries.
It is also present in Shkodër, [[Vlorë]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Durrës]].
[[Socialist classicism]] arrived during the [[Peoples Republic of Albania]] in Albania after the [[Second World War]].
Notable examples of that style include the [[Mother Teresa Square (Tirana)]], [[Pyramid of Tirana]], [[Palace of Congresses]] and so on.
Three Albanian [[Archaeology]] sites are included in the list of [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].
These include the ancient remains of Butrint, the medieval [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër]], and [[Ohrid Lake]] site shared with [[North Macedonia]] since 2019.[381][382] Furthermore, the royal [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme]], the remains of [[Apollonia (Illyria)]], the ancient [[Durrës Amphitheatre]] of Durrës and the [[Fortress of Bashtovë]] has been included on the tentative list of Albania.
Albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and continues to play a major part in overall [[Music of Albania]].
Folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern [[Gheg Albanian]] varieties, and southern [[Labëria]] and [[Tosk Albanian]] varieties.
Many songs concern events from [[History of Albania]] and [[Culture of Albania]], including traditional themes of honour, hospitality, treachery, and revenge.
The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [[Himara]] musicians, [[Neço Muko]] and Koço Çakali, in Paris, during their work with Albanian soprano [[Tefta Tashko-Koço]].
Several [[Phonograph record]] compilations were recorded at the time by the three artists, which eventually led to the recognition of [[Albanian iso-polyphony]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].[384]
[[Festivali i Këngës]] is a traditional Albanian song contest organised by the national broadcaster [[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar]] (RTSH).
The festival is celebrated annually since its inauguration in 1962 and has launched the careers of some of Albania's most successful singers including [[Vaçe Zela]] and [[Parashqevi Simaku]].[385] It is significantly a music competition among Albanian performers presenting unreleased songs in premiere, composed by Albanian authors and voted by juries or by public.
Contemporary artists [[Rita Ora]], [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Era Istrefi]], [[Dua Lipa]], [[Ava Max]], [[Bleona]], [[Elvana Gjata]], [[Ermonela Jaho]], and [[Inva Mula]] have achieved international recognition for their music,[386] while soprano [[Ermonela Jaho]] has been described by some as the "world's most acclaimed soprano".[387] Albanian opera singer [[Saimir Pirgu]] was nominated for the 2017 [[Grammy Award]].[388]
The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications.
The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] translated the [[Catholic liturgy]] into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what [[Martin Luther]] had done for German.
[[Meshari]] (The Missal) written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages.
They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book]] (Rrethimi i Shkodrës) from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (in vernacula lingua) as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti]] (History of Skanderbeg) from 1508.
During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[Catechism]] (E mbësuame krishterë) (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lekë Matrënga]], (Doktrina e krishterë) (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (Rituale romanum) 1621 by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[Prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[Folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty [[Cuneus Prophetarum]] (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language]].
The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].
Throughout the centuries, [[Albanian cuisine]] has been widely influenced by [[Albanian culture]], [[Geography of Albania]] and [[History of Albania]], and as such, different parts of the country enjoy specific [[Regional cuisine]].
Cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to differing [[Topography]] and [[Climate]] that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs, fruits, and vegetables.[389]
Albanians produce and use many varieties of fruits such as [[Lemon]], oranges, [[Fig]], and most notably, [[Olive]], which are perhaps the most important element of Albanian cooking.
Spices and other herbs such as [[Basil]], [[Lavender]], [[Spearmint]], [[Oregano]], [[Rosemary]], and [[Thyme]] are widely used, as are vegetables such as garlic, onions, [[Bell pepper]], potatoes, tomatoes, as well as [[Legume]] of all types.
With a coastline along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], fish, [[Crustacean]], and seafood are a popular and an integral part of the Albanian diet.
Otherwise, [[Lamb (food)]] is the traditional meat for different holidays and [[Religious festival]] for both [[Christianity in Albania]] and [[Islam in Albania]], although poultry, beef, and pork are also in plentiful supply.
[[Tavë kosi]] ("[[Soured milk]] [[Casserole]]") is the [[National dish]] of Albania, consisting of lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [[Yoghurt]].
[[Fërgesë]] is another national dish, made up of peppers, tomatoes, and [[Cottage cheese]].
Pite is also popular, a baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [[Spinach]] and gjizë (curd) or mish ([[Ground meat]]).
Petulla, a traditional fried dough, is also a popular speciality, and is served with [[Powdered sugar]] or [[Feta cheese]] and different sorts of [[Fruit preserves]].
[[Flia]] consists of multiple [[Crêpe]]-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream.
[[Krofne]], similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)]], are filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during winter.
Çaj Mali ([[Sideritis]] tea) is enormously beloved, and a part of the daily routine for most Albanians.
[[Black tea]] is also popular.
[[Albanian wine]] is also common throughout the country, and has been cultivated for thousands of years.
Albania has a long and ancient history of wine production, and belongs to the [[Old World wine]].[391][392]
Albania participated at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] for the first time.
The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in [[Winter Olympics 2006]].
Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in [[1992 Olympic Winter Games]].
The country have been represented by the [[National Olympic Committee of Albania]] since 1972.
The nation has participated at the [[Mediterranean Games]] since the games of [[1987 Mediterranean Games]] in Syria.
The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from [[1987 Mediterranean Games]] to [[2013 Mediterranean Games]].
Popular sports in Albania include [[Football in Albania]], weightlifting, [[Albania national basketball team]], volleyball, tennis, swimming, [[Rugby union]] and gymnastics.
It is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ([[Albanian language]]: Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit, F.SH.F.), which has membership in [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]].
The [[Albania national football team]], ranking 51st in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament.
Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [[Romania national football team]] by 1–0 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] match on 19 June 2016.[393][394] The most successful football clubs are [[KF Skënderbeu Korçë]], [[KF Tirana]], [[FK Dinamo Tirana]], [[FK Partizani Tirana]] and [[KF Vllaznia Shkodër]].
Weightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships]] and the rest international competitions.
Albanian weightlifters have won a total of 16 medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships]] with 1 of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze.
In the [[World Weightlifting Championships]], the Albanian weightlifting team has won in [[1972 World Weightlifting Championships]] a gold in [[2002 World Weightlifting Championships]] a silver and in [[2011 World Weightlifting Championships]] a bronze medal.
