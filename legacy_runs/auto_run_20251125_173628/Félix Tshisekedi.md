Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo[1] (French: [feliks ɑ̃twan tʃisekedi tʃilombo]; born 13 June 1963)[2] is a Congolese politician who has served as the fifth [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], since 2019.[3]
He was the leader of the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] (UDPS), the DRC's oldest and largest party,[4] succeeding his late father [[Étienne Tshisekedi]] in that role, a three-time [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and opposition leader during the reign of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].
Tshisekedi was the UDPS party's candidate for president in the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], which he was awarded, despite accusations of irregularities from several election monitoring organisations and other opposition parties.
The Constitutional Court of the DRC upheld his victory after another opposition politician, [[Martin Fayulu]], challenged the result, but Tshisekedi has been accused of making a deal with his predecessor, [[Joseph Kabila]].
The election marked the first [[Peaceful transition of power]] since the DRC's independence from Belgium in 1960.
Since the [[Common Front for Congo]] (FCC) coalition, which is aligned with Kabila, still controlled the parliament and provincial governorships, Tshisekedi's ability to govern or even appoint a new [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was limited for the first six months of his term.
He named his coalition partner and political heavyweight, [[Vital Kamerhe]], as his Chief of Cabinet, at first having designated him prime minister but not having the parliamentary support to have him successfully appointed.[5] In May 2019, he reached a deal with the parliament's Kabila-aligned majority to appoint [[Sylvestre Ilunga]] prime minister.[6] On 27 July 2019, negotiations finally ended between Tshisekedi and the parliament, agreeing on the formation of a new cabinet.[7]
On 19 May 2024, there was a failed [[2024 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup attempt]] Tshisekedi, led by a group including opposition politician [[Christian Malanga]].
Tshisekedi, a member of the [[Luba people]] ethnic group, was born in [[Kinshasa]] on 13 June 1963 to mother Marthe and father [[Étienne Tshisekedi]], who served as Prime Minister of Zaire in the 1990s.[9] He had a comfortable life as a youth in the capital, but when his father created the UDPS in the early 1980s, publicly opposing [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Félix was forced to accompany him into house arrest in his native village in central [[Kasaï region]].
In late 2008, Tshisekedi was named the UDPS National Secretary for external relations.[10] In November 2011, he obtained a seat in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]], representing the city of [[Mbuji Mayi]] in [[Kasai-Oriental]] province.
In May 2013, he refused a position of [[Rapporteur]] at the [[Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]], saying that he did not want to put his political career on hold[11] as CENI's article 17 excludes membership for those who are members of a political formation.[10]
On 31 March 2018, he was elected to lead the UDPS, after his father's death on 1 February 2017.[12] The same day, the UDPS nominated him for president in the December 2018 [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]].[1]
On 10 January 2019, it was announced that Tshisekedi had won the presidency of the DRC in the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]].[13] He defeated another opposition leader, [[Martin Fayulu]], and [[Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary]], who was supported by term-limited outgoing President Kabila, who had been president for 18 years.
Fayulu, the runner-up, alleged vote rigging and challenged the election results.[14] On 19 January, the [[Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] dismissed the challenge, officially making Tshisekedi president-elect.[15] He was sworn in as president on 24 January 2019,[16] taking office the next day.[3] This marked the first time since the Congo gained independence in 1960 that an incumbent president [[Peacefully transferred power]] to the opposition.[17]
In late April, [[Jeune Afrique]] reported that Kabila proposed to Tshisekedi the mining company executive [[Albert Yuma]] as a candidate for prime minister.
Yuma supports the new Mining Code adopted in 2018, which put the DRC in dispute with international mining companies, and Tshisekedi has been under foreign pressure to not appoint him.[22][23] The Civil Society of [[South Kivu]] recommended to Tshisekedi the appointment of his chief of staff [[Vital Kamerhe]] as prime minister.[24] For months, Tshisekedi continued working with ministers of Kabila's government as he was hamstrung by parliament.
He faced challenges in dealing with the [[Kivu conflict]] as well as the Ebola outbreak in the region.[25] In early March, Tshisekedi started a program to improve infrastructure, transport, education, housing, communication, health, water, and agriculture.[26]
On 20 May 2019, Tshisekedi reached a deal with the [[Common Front for Congo]] coalition and Kabila, appointing the career civil servant [[Sylvestre Ilunga]] as prime minister.
Ilunga began his political career in the 1970s and held a number of cabinet posts under [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] before his overthrow in 1997.
Ilunga's new cabinet would include 65 members, 48 ministers and 17 vice-ministers, which should be divided between the Kabila-aligned FCC and Tshisekedi's [[Heading for Change]] alliance.
After a power struggle saw the coalition with allies of Tshisekedi's predecessor break down and many legislators were won over, Ilunga was forced to leave office and Tshisekedi appointed [[Gécamines]] leader [[Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde]] as successor on 15 February 2021.[32]
Tshisekedi has called for a review of mining contracts signed with [[China]] by his predecessor Joseph Kabila,[35] especially the Sicomines multibillion [[China–Democratic Republic of the Congo relations#Sicomines]].[36][37] He has also promised to end and reverse [[Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] by 2030, in the [[2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]'s first major agreement.[38]
In October 2022, Tshisekedi ruled out bringing in Russian mercenaries to help quell a raging [[M23 offensive (2022–2023)]] and vowed to press on with economic development plans despite the insecurity in the region.[39] Also that same month he announced military reforms to create a more cohesive national army, which has been a diverse mix of integrated rebel groups and the former military of Mobutu's Zaire.
The reform included a new military spending bill.[40] Other measures that he took to strengthen Congo's defenses included appointing new [[Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], hiring [[Romania]] [[Private military contractor]], and bringing additional peacekeepers from the [[East African Community]] and [[Southern African Development Community]] into the [[Kivu]] region.[41]
After [[2023 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], Tshisekedi had a clear lead in his run for a second term.[42] On 31 December 2023, officials said that Tshisekedi had been re-elected with 73% of the vote.
In May 2023, he visited [[China]] and met with Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] to strengthen the [[China–Democratic Republic of the Congo relations]] and renegotiate mining contracts for the DRC's mineral reserves.
The Democratic Republic of Congo is a major producer and exporter of [[Copper]], [[Uranium]] and [[Cobalt]].[44]
On 19 May 2024, he was targeted, alongside his ally [[Vital Kamerhe]], in an [[2024 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup attempt]] launched by the self-proclaimed [[New Zaire (government in exile)]], but managed to foil the attempt quickly.[8][45][46][47]
In October 2024, Tshisekedi walked out of the [[Francophone]] heads of state retreat in Paris after French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] did not mention the [[M23 offensive (2022–present)]] in the eastern DRC in his speech.
He also boycotted a luncheon hosted by [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] head and former Rwandan foreign minister [[Louise Mushikiwabo]].[48]
On 18 January 2025, Tshisekedi reaffirmed Kinshasa's refusal to engage in dialogue with the [[March 23 Movement]], stating, "Legitimizing these criminals would be an insult to the victims and to international law".[49]
Due to [[Rwanda]]'s support for the [[2025 Goma offensive]] by the M23 rebels, the DRC severed diplomatic ties between the two countries on 26 January 2025.[50] Tshisekedi called for a national mobilization, urging citizens to rally behind [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] against what he called "Rwanda's barbaric aggression".[51]
