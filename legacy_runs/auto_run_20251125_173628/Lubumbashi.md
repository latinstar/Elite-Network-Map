Lubumbashi ([[British English]]: /ˌluːbʊmˈbæʃi/ LOO-buum-BASH-ee, [[American English]]: /ˌluːbuːmˈbɑːʃi/ LOO-boom-BAH-shee), formerly Élisabethville ([elizabɛtvil]; [[Dutch language]]: Elisabethstad [eːˈlisaːbɛtstɑt] ⓘ), is the second-largest [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], located in the country's southeasternmost part, near the border with [[Zambia]].
The capital and principal city of the [[Haut-Katanga Province]], Lubumbashi is the center of mining in the region, acting as a hub for many of the country's largest [[Mining]] companies.[4] No definite population figures are available, but the population of the city's urban area is estimated to be around 2,584,000 in 2021.[3]
The Belgian government established the modern-day government in the city of Élisabethville (sometimes Elizabethville, both in French, or Elisabethstad in Dutch) in 1910, named in honour of [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)]], consort to [[King Albert I of the Belgians]].[5] By that time, the government had taken over the colony from King Leopold II, and renamed it as the [[Belgian Congo]].
This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangermée because of its proximity to the copper mine of [[Etoile du Congo Mine]] and the copper ore smelting oven installed by [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] on the nearby Lubumbashi River.
The [[Comité Spécial du Katanga]] (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1900, had its headquarters in Élisabethville throughout the colonial era.
It was the second city of the [[Belgian Congo]], after Léopoldville.
This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as [[History of the Jews in Greece]].
Many men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasaï), from [[Ruanda-Urundi]], and from British [[Northern Rhodesia]] (present-day [[Zambia]]).[7] The black population lived initially in a so-called cité indigène called Quartier Albert (now Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone.
Miners in Élisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe [[Forced labor]] regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the "war efforts".[9] A rally in the Union Minière football stadium got out of hand.
In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the [[Force Publique]] (army) in Luluabourg.[10]
The people of Élisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist [[Alliance des Bakongo]], which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.
The [[Benedictine Order]] and missionary Order of Salesians offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu).
The Belgians established the University of Élisabethville in 1954–1955 (now the [[University of Lubumbashi]]).
Élisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of [[State of Katanga#Secession]] during the 1960–1963 Congolese civil war.
[[Moise Tshombe]] proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960.
[[Roger Trinquier]], well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.
[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Zaïre.
The [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] rebels [[Capture of Lubumbashi]] in April 1997.
Rebel leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.
Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.
960 prisoners managed to escape, including the [[Mai-Mai]] leader [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]].[12] On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard.[4]
The [[Kafue River]] rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central [[Zambia]] to the [[Zambezi River]], cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country.
Lubumbashi has a dry-winter [[Humid subtropical climate]] (Cwa, according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn.
[[French language]] is the official language, but the main spoken [[Lingua franca]] in Lubumbashi is [[Kiswahili]].
The dialect of Kiswahili spoken all down the east side of Congo (including the provinces of [[North Kivu]], [[South Kivu]], [[Maniema]], [[Katanga Province]] and [[Oriental]], Western [[Kasai-Occidental]] and Eastern [[Kasai-Oriental]]) and almost all the way across to the [[Katanga Province]] border with [[Angola]] is called [[Ngwana language]].[14] As many people have moved into Lubumbashi for employment from rural areas, they have brought many other local languages including [[Kiluba]], [[Chokwe language]], [[Bemba language]] and Kisanga.
Religious [[Places of worship]] in Lubumbashi are predominantly [[Christianity]]: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lubumbashi]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Kimbanguist Church]], [[Baptist Community of Congo]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Baptist Community of the Congo River]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Assemblies of God]], [[Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Community in Congo]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).[16] On April 5, 2020, the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] announced plans to construct a temple in Lubumbashi, its second temple in the country.[17] There are also Muslim mosques.
Manufactures include [[Textile]], food products and beverages, [[Printing]], bricks, and copper smelting.
The city hosts the headquarters of one of the country's largest banks, [[Trust Merchant Bank]].
The Democratic Republic of Congo produces "more than 3 percent of the world's copper and half its [[Cobalt]], most of which comes from Katanga."[4]
The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, [[Cobalt]], [[Zinc]], [[Tin]], and coal.
The city is crossed by [[Beira–Lobito Highway]] (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of [[Lusaka]] and [[Kolwezi]].[18]
Lubumbashi is the center of the railway lines from [[Cape to Cairo Railway]], which serves as a link with the cities of [[Ilebo]], [[Kindu]], [[Tenke, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sakania]] and [[Ndola]].[19]
In [[Tenke, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the city connects with [[Kolwezi]] and [[Lobito]], through the [[Benguela railway]].[20]
Lubumbashi is home to the modern [[Lubumbashi International Airport]].[21]
The largest institution of higher education is the [[University of Lubumbashi]], founded in 1955, with also the teaching institutions Protestant University of Lubumbashi and the Graduate Institute of Health Sciences.
Multiple international schools are present in Lubumbashi, including a Belgian school ([[École Privée Belge de Lubumbashi]]), a French school ([[Établissement scolaire français Blaise-Pascal]]), and a British school (British International School of Lubumbashi).
Attractions in the city include a [[Botanical garden]], a [[Zoo]], and the regional archaeological and ethnological [[National Museum of Lubumbashi]].
[[Bogumil Jewsiewicki]] says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan.
Ciné Bétamax, formerly "Ciné Palace" and "Ciné Eden",[24] are the only modern movie theaters in the city which generally show popular recent [[Cinema of the United States]] productions as well as NC-17 films.
However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like [[Mister Bob]], Sniper: Reloaded, SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines, and [[Tears of the Sun]].
Nigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents.
[[Jean-Bosco Mwenda]] is likely the most famous Katangese musician.
Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and Képi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, [[RJ Kanierra]], Oxygène, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other.
Most artists are influenced by successful Dj Spilulu's productions, Kinshasa singers [[Fally Ipupa]], [[Ferré Gola]] and [[World music]].
Lubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages ([[Swahili language]], [[Lingala]], [[Kiluba]], French and some English) in the lyrics.
The [[Institut Français]] (formally known as Centre Culturel Français), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi.
[[Radio Okapi]]'s Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in Métissage, the cultural program of the radio.
They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Canal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, [[Nyota Radio Television]], RTLJ, Malaïka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.
The city is home to [[Association football]] clubs of the top national level such as [[FC Saint Eloi Lupopo]], [[CS Don Bosco]] and [[TP Mazembe]].
TP Mazembe is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 [[CAF Champions League]] and reaching a [[FIFA Club World Cup]] final losing 3-0 against [[Internazionale]].
The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga [[Moïse Katumbi Chapwe]].
Smith Cup.[25] The [[Katanga Province]] tournament was won by teams from Lubumbashi every recorded season except 2005.
