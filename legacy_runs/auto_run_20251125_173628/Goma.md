Goma is a city in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
It is the [[Capital city]] and largest city of the [[North Kivu]]; it is located on the northern shore of [[Lake Kivu]] and shares borders with the [[Bukumu Chiefdom]] to the north, [[Rwanda]] to the east and the [[Masisi Territory]] to the west.
The city lies in the [[Albertine Rift]], the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], and is only 13–18 km (8.1–11.2 mi) south of the active volcano [[Mount Nyiragongo]].
With an approximate area of 75.72 km2 (29.24 sq mi), the city had a population of 782,000 people in 2024,[5]
with an additional 500,000 [[Displaced people]].[6][7][8]
Goma is administratively divided into two urban municipalities: [[Goma (commune)]] and [[Karisimbi (commune)]], which are further subdivided into 18 [[Quarter (urban subdivision)]], colloquially recognized as "[[Neighbourhood]]" in the English lexicon.
The city is home to several notable landmarks, including [[Goma International Airport]], the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Virunga National Park]], the private [[Christianity]] [[Mixed-sex education]] school [[Adventist University of Goma]], the [[University of Goma]], and is also surrounded by the active [[Virunga Mountains]], which includes volcanoes [[Nyamuragira]], [[Mount Nyiragongo]], [[Mount Mikeno]], [[Mount Bisoke]], [[Mount Gahinga]], [[Mount Karisimbi]], and [[Mount Sabyinyo]].
Goma also hosts the annual [[Festival Amani]], the [[Free University of the Great Lakes Countries]], which supports local development initiatives, as well as the regional cultural center and art school, [[Foyer Culturel de Goma]].
The recent history of Goma has been dominated by the volcano and the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994, which in turn fueled the [[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]].
The city was captured by rebels of the [[March 23 Movement]] during the [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)]] in late 2012, and then retaken by Congolese government forces.
As of January 2025[update], the city is once again under the control of M23, following [[M23 offensive (2022–present)]] that culminated in the [[2025 Goma offensive]].[9]
The name Goma derived from a modification of [[Ngoma drums]], the city's former designation, a term of profound cultural and linguistic relevance among [[Bantu languages]]-speaking communities throughout [[Central Africa]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[East Africa]].[10][11][12][13] Ngoma is translated as "[[Drum]]", and is commonly associated with ritual dances and ceremonies in these regions.[12][13] This etymological link is believed to allude to the resonant, drum-like sounds emitted during a volcanic eruption that altered the area's historical topography.[10] The eruption led to the destruction of the original village, prompting its inhabitants to disperse and establish three new villages: Ngoma, which evolved into modern Goma; Matcha, contemporary [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]]; and Munti, which is now known as [[Bukumu Chiefdom#Administrative division]].[10]
Residents of Goma are sometimes referred to as Gomatraciens, though this term is seldom used locally.[14] The suffix "-tracien" has scientific connotation classifications, often associated with the taxonomy of animal species, particularly [[Amphibian]], which has led to its perception as artificial and unsuitable for describing human inhabitants.[14] Instead, the term Goméen is favored for its more humanistic and natural connotation.[14]
Goma is the largest and [[Capital city]] of the [[North Kivu]] Province in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].[15]
To Goma's north lies [[Nyiragongo Territory]], the [[Republic of Rwanda]] to the east, Lake Kivu to the south, and [[Masisi Territory]] to the west.[16][17] Goma is strategically located on the Goma plain, which is composed of [[Volcano]] [[Lava]] and gradual [[Slope stability]] gently towards [[Lake Kivu]].[17][18] The plain is also bordered by the [[Virunga Mountains]] to the west, which comprises prominent peaks such as [[Nyamuragira]], [[Mount Nyiragongo]], [[Mount Mikeno]], [[Mount Bisoke]], [[Mount Gahinga]], [[Mount Karisimbi]] and [[Mount Sabyinyo]].[17] Elevations in the northern part of the plain range from 1,640 to 2,000 m (5,380 to 6,560 ft), with the volcanic fields of Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo exhibiting continuous [[Carbon dioxide]] [[Degassing]].
Nyiragongo, in particular, has been active since the early 1900s, featuring an active [[Lava lake]] and periodic eruptions, including notable events in 1977, 2002, and 2021.[19]
The predominant terrain of Goma is [[Volcano]], with only a small portion consisting of slightly [[Sand]] soil.[18] The surface is covered with [[Basalt]] flows, creating a [[Orthent]] profile.
The vegetation in Goma is predominantly [[Savanna]] interspersed with [[Shrub]].[20] The city's [[Aesthetics]] appeal is further enhanced by [[Artificial plants]], including trees planted by landowners, which mitigates temperature fluctuations.
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies Goma's climate as a [[Tropical savanna climate]] (Aw).[21] Goma is much milder than most climates of its latitude due to the city's high altitude, and sees warm days and pleasant nights year-round.
Goma spreads over an approximate area of 75.72 km2 (29.24 sq mi) and has an estimated population of nearly 2 million people according to the 2022 census.[6] In 1984, its population was estimated at 80,000.[23] The city is administratively divided into two urban municipalities: [[Goma (commune)]] and [[Karisimbi (commune)]], which are further subdivided into 18 [[Quarter (urban subdivision)]], colloquially recognized as "[[Neighbourhood]]" in the English lexicon.[6] This division was officially institutionalized through Ordinance Law No. 48-127 on 22 May 1989, which formalized the city's [[Communes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (municipalities) and quartiers (quarters).[20] Each neighborhood is further subdivided into smaller administrative units, including avenues, cells, and a local governance model called Nyumba Kumi (ten houses).[24] Introduced in 1997 by the [[AFDL]] (AFDL), the Nyumba Kumi system is akin to a similar administrative framework in Rwanda.[24] The Nyumba Kumi structure is managed by appointed individuals under the authority of the neighborhood chief, who supervises ten households.[24]
The administrative leadership is centralized under a [[Mayor]], who is assisted by a [[Deputy mayor]].
For instance, Katoyi quartier was divided into Kasika and Katoyi quartiers, while Mabanga quartier was divided into Mabanga North and Mabanga South quartiers.[25] Parenthetically, the provincial authorities granted permission for the establishment of a new quartier, Bujovu, within the [[Karisimbi (commune)]], comprising cells from the Majengo and Virunga quartiers, namely Byahi and Tyazo cells.[25]
The village of Ngoma was a port for lake traffic and a crossroads for the overland trade routes between [[Central Africa]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].
In 1894, the explorer [[Gustav Adolf von Götzen]], following the footsteps of an earlier missionary, was traveling to Rwanda from the eastern coast of Africa and passed through the village, which he recorded as Goma.[26][27] In 1906, officers of the [[Congo Free State]] established Goma post opposite [[Gisenyi]] as a military outpost to oversee [[Maritime transport]] activities on [[Lake Kivu]], which later transformed into a civil status office.[28][29] Around 1930, the Goma precinct accommodated camps for laborers of the Eastern Railway (CFE), initially sited along Lake Kivu's eastern shores.[29] By the mid-20th century, Goma had become an essential hub, serving as the endpoint of the [[Société des Chemins de Fer Vicinaux du Congo]] road network and a port for the [[Transshipment]] of agricultural commodities and [[Building material]] to and from [[Bukavu]].[29][30] In 1945, Goma burgeoned into a state post under [[Rutshuru Territory]]'s jurisdiction, experiencing a rapid demographic upsurge with approximately 8,600 inhabitants.[31][29] Goma's prominence as a city grew steadily, earning it the status of an extra-customary center that year.[29] Educational infrastructure developed in tandem, with institutions such as the "École Royale" (now the Goma Institute or INSTIGO) and the École Primaire d'Application de l'institut de Goma (EPAIGO) catering to European settlers.[32] Meanwhile, the native population relied on the Saint André School, later renamed Keshero Primary School, for [[Primary education]].[32]
The inception of urbanization in [[Belgian Congo]] was formalized with the promulgation of a decree on 21 February 1949, which instituted entities responsible for evaluating and issuing building permits, overseeing demolitions, modifying land plots, and making changes to the urban landscape.[33] In 1951, Goma was elevated to the territorial and capital level of North Kivu.
This period also witnessed movements advocating for administrative separation between Goma and Rutshuru, leading to the establishment of deliberative and executive bodies in Kirotshe and later in [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]].[29]
On 25 December 1966, North Kivu regained its district status before becoming a region following the constitutional referendum of June 1967.[29] By 10 July 1988, North Kivu attained its regional autonomy, promulgating its status as a sovereign entity within the [[Kivu]] into provinces: [[North Kivu]], [[South Kivu]], and [[Maniema]].[29] A decree issued on 14 September 1988, outlined critical urban development guidelines, such as construction alignments, the delineation of housing plans and communication routes, and the segregation of sustainable residential districts from native-dominated huts.[33] This marked the onset of a segregationist urban paradigm, in which Congolese cities became characterized by a dichotomy between modern urban centers and native settlements, resulting in the coexistence of two disparate forms of urban development.[33] As a result of Goma's burgeoning urbanization, the city was officially designated as the provincial capital of the newly established North Kivu Province under Ordinance Law No. 88-178, issued on 15 November 1988.[33]
The [[Rwandan genocide]] was executed by the interim Rwandan government against the [[Tutsi]] population and [[Hutu]] moderates.
In response, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees from Uganda, who already held control over significant portions of northern Rwanda after their invasion in 1990 and the ongoing [[Rwandan Civil War]], overthrew the Hutu government in [[Kigali]], forcing them out.[35][36][37][38] Over two million Hutus fled the country to Zaire and many Tutsis and Hutus were internally displaced within Rwanda.[39] Although Hutu extremists were responsible for the mass killing of Tutsis, scholars like Judi Rever and [[Filip Reyntjens]] argue that the main perpetrators of the slaughter were the Tutsi-dominated RPF, led by [[Paul Kagame]].[40][41][42][43] According to Judi Rever, Kagame personally commanded massacres at places like [[Byumba]] soccer stadium in northern Rwanda and ordered the pursuit of Hutus in the Zairean forests.[44] They devised ways to dispose of large numbers of bodies by "dissolving them in acid, dumping them in rivers and swamps, or burning them, and established open air crematorium".[45] Various UN missions attempted to establish safe zones and facilitate the movement of refugees.
Between 13 June and 14 July 1994, an overwhelming number of refugees, ranging from 10,000 to 12,000 per day, fled across the border to Goma, resulting in a severe [[Humanitarian crisis]],[46] as there was an acute lack of shelter, food and water.
Shortly after the arrival of nearly one million [[Refugee]],[47] a deadly [[Cholera]] outbreak swept through the Hutu refugee camps near Goma, claiming thousands of lives.
As early as mid-1996, infiltrated units from Rwanda began targeting [[Massacres of Hutus during the First Congo War]] along the [[Rutshuru]] road, even before formal hostilities began.
On the evening of 27 June 1996, an infiltrated group allegedly carried out an attack on the Kibumba refugee camp, resulting in casualties among Hutu refugees, soldiers from the Contingent Zaïrois pour la sécurité des camps (CZSC), and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] personnel.[48]
During the [[First Congo War]], from mid-October 1996, Rwandan infiltrations intensified, accompanied by sporadic attacks on refugee camps along the Goma to Rutshuru road by the newly formed [[AFDL]] (AFDL), a rebel movement led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], and [[Rwanda Defence Force]] (RPA) led by [[Paul Kagame]], who aimed to overthrow [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s regime, accusing him of excluding Tutsis from governance and failing to stop the [[Génocidaires]].[48] However, the [[United Nations Security Council]] noted that both the RPA and AFDL pillaged Zaire's minerals for nearly two and a half decades and conducted massacres throughout the conflict.[49][50][51] The Kibumba camp, situated twenty-five kilometers north of Goma, was the first to fall under assault.
Subsequently, approximately 194,000 refugees fled Kibumba towards the Mugunga camp.[48] The Katale camp also faced attacks on the same night, but [[Forces Armées Zaïroises]] (FAZ)/CZSC soldiers and ex-FAR/[[Interahamwe]] units repelled the assailants initially.[48] However, on 26 October 1996, AFDL and RPA forces attacked the Katale camp, resulting in numerous Hutu refugee casualties and the death of a Zairian soldier.
They also allegedly killed several Hutu refugees using [[Edged and bladed weapons]].
Following confrontations with FAZ soldiers and ex-FAR/Interahamwe units from the Katale camp, who offered reinforcement, AFDL and RPA forces seized control of the FAZ military camp at [[Rumangabo]].[48]
By 30 October, refugees from Katale and [[Katindo]] camps began to depart, with some heading towards [[Masisi]] via Tongo groupement of [[Bwito Chiefdom]], while others attempted to reach the Mugunga camp through the [[Virunga National Park]].
On 31 October 1996, AFDL and RPA soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of Hutu refugees who remained in the Kahindo and Katale camps.[48] Roberto Garretón, the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] on the violation of human rights in Zaire, estimated the casualties and highlighted the brutality inflicted on the refugees.[48]
The [[DRC Mapping Exercise Report]] team documented numerous alleged incidents, including mass burials and killings in and around refugee camps between November 1996 and April 1997.[48] The violence extended beyond the dismantling of refugee camps; Hutu survivors faced persecution while attempting to flee.
By the end of 1997, AFDL rebels advanced to [[Kinshasa]], driving out Mobutu and leading to Laurent-Désiré Kabila proclaiming himself president on 17 May, renaming the country the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).[52]
Within a year of assuming power, [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] found himself in conflict with his former allies, and in 1998, the Rwandan government threw its support behind a Goma-based rebel movement known as the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), occasionally denoted as [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]].[53][54] The Goma refugee encampments, where Hutu refugees and Interahamwe militants had forged a militia known as the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR), morphed into battlegrounds as Rwandan government forces and the RCD clashed with them to assert dominion.[55][53]
On 2 August 1998, General Sylvain Buki announced via [[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise]] (RTNC) in Goma that a rebellion had erupted within the [[Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (FAC).[56] The 10th Brigade of the FAC mutinied, leading to the swift capture of Goma by the RCD and Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), with minimal resistance.
Goma remained beyond the reach of the Kinshasa government's forces for nearly three years, save for [[Barrage (artillery)]].[56] Amidst these conflicts, the RCD's bias towards the local Tutsi community, Rwandan interference in provincial affairs, and the brutality of RCD and RPA troops towards civilians in North Kivu prompted many locals to join [[Mai-Mai]] armed groups to defend their communities.
With support from Kinshasa, the Mayi–Mayi and [[Army for the Liberation of Rwanda]] intensified ambushes and pillaging against RCD/RPA soldiers and civilian populations.
In response, they increased search operations in various regions.[56] The [[Second Congo War]] was unprecedented in Africa for the loss of civilian life in massacres and atrocities.
By 2003, the Rwandan [[Banyamulenge]]-supported insurgent factions wearied of the conflict, and discord surfaced between them and Rwanda.
In 2002 and 2003, a tenuous [[Pretoria Accord]] ensued among the myriad factions embroiled in the conflict.[57][58]
In 2006, it became a focal point for the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s 81st and 83rd Brigades, who remained faithful to Congolese Tutsi military defector [[Laurent Nkunda]], who accused the government of neglecting to assimilate his military faction into the national army and failing to safeguard their interests.[59][60] Numerous heinous crimes were committed by Nkunda during his reign of terror.
In 2002, he sanctioned the massacre of over 150 people in [[Kisangani]].[61] In [[Bukavu]] in 2004, his insurgent affiliates, in conjunction with Colonel [[Jules Mutebutsi]], executed widespread atrocities, including sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, predominantly targeting young girls.[61][62] [[Human Rights Watch]] clamored for Nkunda's arrest in February 2006,[61] but it wasn't until June of that year that his military faction made significant territorial gains, capturing localities like [[Bunagana, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], located 80 km from Goma.[63]
By November 2006, reports cited three fatalities and 41 injuries, among them civilians,[64] and by December, the violence had displaced over 80,000 people, many of whom sought refuge on the outskirts of Goma.[65] The conflict escalated further in early 2007, with Goma's healthcare organization, Groupe d'Entraide et de Solidarité Médicale (GESOM), treating an average of three rape survivors daily from both urban and rural sectors.[66] On 17 May, FARDC arrested 14 Rwandan nationals, including members of Nkunda's brigade, as [[MONUSCO]] noted that his militia in North Kivu was wearing distinctive Rwandan military uniforms.[67] Later in May, the French Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bernard Prévost, visited the Mugunga displacement camp near [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and announced that [[France]] would allocate over [[Euro sign]]2.6 million to the [[World Food Programme]] to support displaced persons in the eastern DRC.[68] In June 2007, [[William L.
Swing]], Director General of the [[International Organization for Migration]], expressed profound concern about the escalating conflict, citing rising insecurity, ethnic discord, the swelling numbers of internally displaced persons, and an increase in human rights abuses in North Kivu.[69] Toward the end of June, Rwandan combatants launched a deadly assault on Lake Kivu, resulting in the deaths of four people, including three fishermen and a [[Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] officer.[70] The attackers also looted valuable fishing equipment and an [[Outboard motor]].
On 6 September, MONUSCO brokered a ceasefire between the FARDC and forces loyal to Laurent Nkunda.[71] However, the following day saw renewed clashes, with most of the population from Goma's surrounding regions seeking shelter in the Mugunga, Lac-Vert, and Ndosho neighborhoods, as well as Goma Centre, fearing further confrontations between the FARDC and Nkunda's forces.[71] Fighting between Nkunda's forces and the [[Mai-Mai]] community-based militia, Congolese Patriotic Resistance (PARECO), which claimed to protect its community from Nkunda's forces, led to the deaths of 5 people in Bitonga in southern Masisi Territory.[72] Nine deceased people were subsequently uncovered in three separate [[Mass grave]] within Rubare, approximately 12 km from [[Rutshuru]], north of Goma.[73] Two other bodies were discovered in the administrative support post of Kisharo's office, around 20 kilometers from Kiwanja, along the route to Nyamilima and Shasha, within Rutshuru Territory.[74] On 27 October 2008, the [[2008 Nord-Kivu campaign]] broke out in the city between the Congolese army, supported by MONUSCO, and Nkunda's [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] rebels; 200,000 refugees fled the town.[75]
On 3 November 2012 there was a [[2012 Congolese–Rwandan border clash]] on the border just north of Goma.
Goma was later seized by the [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)]] on 20 November 2012.[76] During the M23's brief rule, the city endured ten days of chaos, marked by looting and executions, bringing economic activities to a standstill and forcing residents into seclusion.[77][78]
On 22 February 2021, the [[List of ambassadors of Italy to the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Luca Attanasio]], was killed in an apparent kidnapping attempt near [[Virunga National Park]].
He was part of the U.N.'s [[World Food Programme]] (WFP).
Among them, more than 600,000 have fled to overcrowded and unsanitary camps on the fringes of Goma.[79] [[Gender-related violence]] has also soared in the region, resulting in the prevalence of a pervasive culture of impunity.
Between 17–30 April 2023, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) teams treated 674 victims of sexual violence in camps like Bulengo, Lushagala, and Rusayo, with 360 cases reported solely from the latter, a recently established and densely inhabited settlement situated to the west of Goma.[79] The vast majority of these victims were attacked while venturing outside the displaced sites in search of basic necessities like [[Firewood]] and [[Sustenance]].[79] Banks do not supply cash since M23 occupation.[80]
The M23's offensive in early February 2024 around [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], roughly twenty kilometers from Goma, exposed civilians to heavy fighting and forced more displacement towards Goma and previously settled sites or with host families on the Sake-[[Bweremana]] axis towards the province from [[South Kivu]] in the [[Kalehe Territory]].[81] This influx of displaced people strains already limited resources and infrastructure, making it increasingly challenging to meet the needs of affected communities.
Some regional initiatives have addressed the crisis, with the deployment of [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) forces and summits between heads of state to relaunch the [[Peace process]] and secure a [[Ceasefire]] in the region.[81]
On 12 February, South Africa announced it would send 2,900 troops as part of its contribution to the SADC force deployed to tackle armed groups in the eastern DRC.[82] On 15 February, two South African soldiers were killed and three wounded by a [[Mortar (weapon)]] launched by M23 rebels.[83] The road to lasting peace remains fraught with challenges, including the need for direct dialogue between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.[81]
As of January 2025, the city is once again the target [[2025 Goma offensive]], which resulted in multiple casualties, injuries, looting, destruction of property, and mass displacement.[84] Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the fighting in Goma.[85] On 27 January 2025, more than 4,000 prisoners escaped from Muzenze prison.[86] It was reported that hundreds of female inmates were raped and burned alive during the mass jailbreak from Goma's prison.[87]
Goma has been heavily affected by [[Sexual violence]], which is deeply intertwined with the ongoing regional conflicts, economic instability, and social challenges that have marked the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo for decades.[88][89][90] Armed groups, local militias, and, at times, even some members of state forces have been implicated in sexual violence against civilians.[91] Such violations are often weaponized as a deliberate tool of war to terrorize communities, assert control, and break down social cohesion.[91] Survivors often face physical [[Injury]], [[Sexually transmitted infection]], [[Psychological trauma]], and [[Social stigma]].
A study from 2007 revealed that around 1.69–1.80 million women aged 15–29 in the DRC reported experiencing [[Sexual assault]] at some point in their lives, with North Kivu recording 223,262 cases, the highest rate nationally.[91] Further research in 2010 indicated that 39.7% of women in North and South Kivu had experienced sexual violence.[91] In 2023, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) reported a sharp increase in sexual violence cases in the DRC, mainly concentrated in and around Goma.
Despite substantial media coverage, sexual violence within the DRC remains insufficiently addressed in [[Medical literature]].
A study conducted in Goma from 2013 to 2017 revealed that sexual violence disproportionately affected females below 18 years, with an average age of 16.5 years.[91] Half of the perpetrators were known to the survivors; 12% of survivors tested positive for pregnancy, and 43% received [[Emergency contraception]].[91]
In a separate study covering January 2019 to December 2020, [[Karisimbi (commune)]] municipality in Goma reported 551 cases of sexual violence, while the [[Goma (commune)]] municipality recorded 149 cases.[91] The Majengo neighborhood in Karisimbi reported the highest frequency, with 129 cases.[91] Among the survivors, women aged 20–29 represented 28.6%, with only 15.7% reporting incidents occurring within their homes, and 60.7% of incidents involved the use of weapons.[91] [[Vaginal trauma]] occurred in all cases, and other forms of assault, like touching, occurred in 7.2% of cases.
Strangers constituted 64.7% of the perpetrators, and 61.4% of assailants were identified as members of military or police forces.[91] Among survivors, 8.1% had a [[Physical disability]].
Of the 700 survivors, only 16.1% sought [[Doctor's visit]] for [[Genital trauma]], and 0.7% presented with [[Muteness]].[91] Approximately 60.6% sought [[Health care]] within 72 hours, with 8.1% testing positive for [[HIV]].[91] Of the survivors, 76.3% underwent [[Pregnancy test]], 6.4% of which were positive.
Additionally, 55.4% of survivors received [[Birth control]], and 91.1% were offered [[Post-exposure prophylaxis]] treatment for HIV.[91]
For over three decades, Goma has served as a major site for [[Internally displaced person]] (IDPs), predominantly due to the recurrent waves of violence and humanitarian emergencies besieging the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjacent regions.[94][95] The displacement crisis commenced in the aftermath of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]], during which approximately 1.2 million refugees,[96] predominantly Hutus, entered eastern Congo, with between 500,000 and 850,000 people arriving in Goma over a span of five days in mid-July 1994.[97] This mass migration was one of the largest cross-border movements in recent history, with many refugees establishing makeshift camps around Goma.[97]
The initial influx of refugees in July 1994 saw an immediate health emergency, as overcrowded camps lacked [[Water pollution]], [[Sanitation]], and hygiene facilities.
The first case of cholera was diagnosed on 20 July 1994, leading to a major outbreak within the camps that saw an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 cases in less than a month.[97] Concurrently, an outbreak of bloody [[Diarrhea]] caused by [[Shigella dysenteriae]] type 1 emerged in early August, persisting in the camps until November.
The influx also led to severe [[Food security]] among IDPs, resulting in widespread malnutrition, particularly affecting children.
Between January 2000 and December 2007, cholera remained a persistent threat in North and South Kivu, with 73,605 reported cases and 1,612 deaths, resulting in a [[Lethality]] rate of 2.2%.[109] In North Kivu, the cholera strains identified included [[Vibrio cholerae]] O1 El Tor Ogawa and Inaba, with the latter being exclusive to South Kivu.[109] Annual cholera outbreaks peaked at over 700 cases per week, particularly affecting health districts bordering lakes.
In 2012, nearly 1 million children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition, with North Kivu, where Goma is located, being particularly affected.[110] Food shortages further hindered access to adequate nutrition for IDPs.[111][112][113] Continuous exposure to violence and trauma led to pervasive [[Mental health]] issues, including [[Anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)]], and [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), with limited mental health support available in the region.[114][115]
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] further intensified health challenges for IDPs, as healthcare systems became severely strained, limiting access to treatment and vaccination.
A [[Pastor]] infected during the [[Kivu Ebola epidemic]] in the region was found in mid-July 2019 to have travelled to Goma.[121] In August 2019, Rwandan Health Minister [[Diane Gashumba]] announced that students in Rwanda would cease attending school in Goma due to the Ebola outbreak, which has claimed the lives of over 1,800 people within the past year.[122]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo confirmed its first case of [[COVID-19]] on 10 March 2020.[123][124][125][126] Following this, the virus spread throughout the country, resulting in a cumulative total of over 56,086 cases and 1,068 deaths (1.9% [[Lethality]]) as of 5 September 2021.[125] Kinshasa reported the highest number of cases, followed by North Kivu, which constituted 10.4% (5,841 cases) of the national aggregate.[125] Within Goma, the virus predominantly disseminated via community-based transmission.[125]
In response, the DRC instituted stringent containment protocols to attenuate the ramifications of COVID-19, in alignment with the directives of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the national [[Ministry of Public Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]].[125] These regulations encompassed the closure of educational institutions, places of worship, markets, and various public venues, coupled with prohibitions on large congregations, resulting in the cancellation of Goma's annual [[Festival Amani]] in 2021.[125][127][128][129] Despite these measures, Goma's economy confronted considerable adversities, with the city encountering a pronounced inflation rate of 16.4% in 2020, juxtaposed with 4.6% in the preceding year.[130] This inflationary pressure undermined household incomes and diminished overall quality of life.[131] However, by July 2024, the DRC achieved a significant milestone, reporting no new COVID-19 cases.[132]
Due to the [[Great Rift Valley]] being pulled apart, the area experiences frequent [[Earthquake]] and the formation of new [[Volcano]].
Over time, volcanic eruptions have directly impacted Goma, with significant [[Lava]] flows destroying nearby villages, neighborhoods, and roads north of the city.[19] The 1923 and 1997 eruptions caused significant damage and loss of life, with lava flows encroaching upon [[Lake Kivu]]'s shores and destroying sections of the city.[133][19][134]
In January 2002, [[Nyiragongo]] erupted, sending a stream of [[Lava]] 200 metres (219 yd) to one kilometre (1,100 yards) wide and up to two metres (6½ ft) deep through the center of the city as far as the lake shore.
There were some fatalities caused by the lava and by emissions of [[Carbon dioxide]], which causes [[Asphyxiation]].
The lava also covered over the northern 1 km of the 3-kilometre (9,800 ft) [[Runway]] of [[Goma International Airport]], isolating the terminal and apron which were at that end.[135] The lava can easily be seen in satellite photographs,[136] and aircraft can be seen using the 2-km (6,500-ft) southern section of the runway which is clear of lava.
In March 2004, emissions from Nyiragongo volcano polluted the surrounding areas of North Kivu, including Rusayo, Bishusha, Birambizo, Tongo, [[Kitchanga]], and [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] with [[Water vapor]] (H2O) laden with [[Fluorine]] and [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO2).[137]
On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo erupted with lava flows closing a road and reaching the [[Goma International Airport]].[138] The Buhene neighborhood, located on the edge of Goma, was engulfed in [[Flame]], and more than 500 homes were covered in cooling [[Lava]].
Parts of Virunga Energies's electricity facilities, which supplied electricity to nearly 15,000 homes in the city, were destroyed.[139] Thousands of people fled to nearby regions, with some boarding boats on [[Lake Kivu]], which lies on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.
Around 5,000 people crossed the border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 went northwest towards [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]].[140][141] The lava stopped flowing around 3 a.m. on 30 May 2021, and the Congolese government ordered the city's evacuation plan to be set in motion.[140] On the same day, residents returned to Goma to check on their homes.
However, the [[UNICEF]] reported that more than 170 children were still missing.[140] The official report on the number of deaths is yet to be released, but the Minister of Communication and Media, [[Patrick Muyaya Katembwe]], said at least 15 people died.
Nine people died in a [[Traffic collision]], four died while trying to escape from the central prison of Munzenze, and two were calcined by lava.[142]
On 9 May 2023, lava flows were seen inside the central [[Crater]] of [[Nyamuragira]].
By 17 May, a large glow above the volcano was visible, leading to lava flows in [[Virunga National Park]].[143][144][145] While the lava flows do not harm the population, the volcano emits large amounts of gas and fine particles.
[[Thermal radiation]] over the crater increased sharply on 19 May, indicating an increase in the outpouring of lava, but the activity was still confined to the summit.[143] [[Effusive eruption]] increased further on 20 May, forming two large lobes — one outside the [[Caldera]] to the west and another to the south.
Although not visible, [[Satellite imagery]] on May 19 and 20 showed that the current eruption at the volcano was emitting enormous amounts of [[Sulfur dioxide]] (SO2).[143]
[[Lake Kivu]] is one of three lakes in Africa identified as having huge quantities of dissolved gas held at pressure in its depths.
The other two, [[Cameroon]]'s [[Lake Monoun]] and [[Lake Nyos]], experienced [[Limnic eruptions]] or "lake overturns", catastrophic releases of suffocating carbon dioxide probably triggered by landslides.
The [[Carbon dioxide]]-rich gas location, known locally as [[Mazuku]] has recently caused the death of people and animals.[148][149]
Historically, the city's population was relatively modest, estimated at just 80,000 in 1984.[151] However, significant demographic shifts have occurred due to [[Rate of natural increase]], [[Internal migration]], and the influx of [[Refugee]] from neighboring countries, particularly during periods of regional instability.[151][152][153]
The city's population dynamics were profoundly impacted by the [[Rwandan genocide]] (1994), the [[First Congo War]] (1996–1997), and the [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003), as well as ongoing regional tensions involving [[M23 offensive (2022–present)]].[154] These events led to large-scale [[Rural-to-urban migration]], with individuals and families seeking refuge from [[Ethnic conflict]], [[Political violence]], and [[Economic stability]] in rural areas.
The city's demographic composition consists predominantly of [[Bantu languages]]-speaking ethnic groups, including the [[Konjo people]], [[Nyanga people]], [[Hunde people]], [[Hutu]], Tembo, [[Bushi (region)]], Kano, and [[Tutsi]] communities.[154][159]
Goma is home of the annual [[Festival Amani]] which celebrates peace; in 2020, it attracted an audience of 36,000.[160]
Goma serves as the [[North Kivu]]'s [[Cultural center]] and boasts a vibrant entertainment and performing arts scene that encompasses various media forms, including television productions, radio broadcasts, theatre, cinematic expressions, multimedia installations, and print publications.
Like many cities in DRC, Goma is renowned for its lively music scene with popular genres such as [[Soukous]], [[Congolese rumba]], [[Ndombolo]], and [[Jazz]].[161][162] Notable figures in Goma's popular culture scene include [[Innoss'B]], [[Jonathan Kuminga]], [[Rebecca Kabugho]], [[Anzor Alem]], [[Ley Uwera]], Petna Ndaliko Katondolo, [[Alicios Theluji]], El Weezya Fantastikoh, [[Christophe Madihano]], Patient Ligodi, Voldie Mapenzi, Mista Faba, Belamy Paluku, Willow Miller, and Vicky YM.[163][164][165][166][167][168]
Additionally, the Goma Institute organized a school troupe under the leadership of the then-prefect Lumaya Ombwel, featuring talented student actors like Robert De Souza, also known as Kablan or Gilima, and Mwamba, alias Ringo.[169] On 16 March 2013, Goma played host to the inaugural [[Chukudu]] race, a [[Wooden bicycle]] race organized by the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) and Association of Volunteers of Congo (Association des Volontaires du Congo; ASVOCO), which aimed to provide opportunities for the region's unemployed youth and promote peace, with the proceeds benefiting children in [[Kitchanga]].[170][171][172]
Goma is a hub of art and craftsmanship, with skilled artisans creating intricate wood [[Carving]], [[Pottery]], [[Textile]], and [[Jewellery]].[173][169][174][175] The city is home to Petna Ndaliko Katondolo's acclaimed multigenre film productions, which embrace a decolonial Ejo Lobi ([[Afrofuturism]]) aesthetic that weaves together historical narratives to confront contemporary sociopolitical and cultural paradigms.[163]
The [[Foyer Culturel de Goma]] is the city's most significant [[Cultural center]], which plays a pivotal role in nurturing emerging talents, including [[Musician]], [[Poet]], thespians, and [[Visual arts]], as well as fostering the proliferation and commercialization of indigenous culture and artistic expression within the North Kivu Province.[176][177] The city also hosts the [[Festival Amani]], a [[Transculturalism]] [[Festival]] drawing participants from the [[African Great Lakes]] region along with international artists and representatives of different ethnic groups from the region.[178] Goma also houses Yole! Africa, a youth cultural center promoting peace through art, music, dance, and film.[179][180] The renowned spectacle "Au Chemin des Urnes", hosted by the French Institute (IF) of Goma, celebrates the city's poetic, musical, and rhythmic tapestry.[181][182]
Urbanization in Goma is in a state of progressive expansion, though the [[Cityscape]] remains predominantly characterized by horizontal, [[Low-rise building]].[183] Concentrated largely around [[National Road 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]], commercial activity is vigorous, with numerous bars, shops, Nganda (local eateries), and hotels lining this central corridor.[183] Major commercial zones such as Supermatch, [[Nyiragongo Cement]], and several key stations like Ihusi, IBB Service, AFRICOM, Ni Yetu, Tout Jeune, and GPI dominate the city's urban landscape.[183]
While low-rise architecture remains the prevailing style due to its affordability and practicality, multi-[[Storey]] buildings are beginning to emerge.[183] Goma's traditional wood board construction, popular due to its speed and cost-efficiency, is increasingly complemented by more durable vertical structures, which require significantly more extended construction periods due to the materials and techniques involved.[183]
One of the most notable developments in Goma is the Birere neighborhood, also known as Mikeno.[184][185] The area, located within the [[Goma (commune)]], is recognized as the city's oldest residential neighborhood.
Goma is a popular tourist destination and offers a variety of attractions.[186] [[Virunga National Park]], located north of Goma, boasts more than 3,000 [[Fauna]] and [[Flower]] species.[187] [[Tchegera Island]] is located southwest of Goma.[188]
Staple foods include [[Cassava]], [[Cooking banana]], [[Maize]], and [[Rice]], often served alongside a variety of [[Meat]], [[Fish]], and [[Vegetable]].
Local specialties such as [[Ugali]] (a starchy dough), sambaza (small [[Dried fish]]), and [[Sombe]] (cassava leaves cooked in [[Peanut]] sauce) are popular among both residents and visitors.[189][161]
Goma offers various [[Cellular network]] services such as [[Supercell (mobile network)]], [[Bharti Airtel]], [[Vodacom]], [[Orange RDC]] (formerly Congo Chine Télécoms), and [[Millicom]], which facilitate communication exchanges locally and internationally and play an integral role in business transactions, [[Social relation]], and [[Emergency service]].[161]
The city boasts a variety of [[Swahili language]], [[Lingala]], and [[French language]] language radio stations, including [[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise]], [[Radio Okapi]], RSI (Radio Sauti ya Injili), Radio La Colombe, RTCT (Radio Télévision Communautaire Taina), RTC (Radio Télévision la Colombe), Kivu 1, Mishapi Voice TV, Mutaani, RSM (Radio Sauti ya Matumaini), VBR (Virunga Business Radio), Pool FM, RAO FM (Radio Alpha Omega), COMICO, Emmanuel TV, and Source de Vie, offering various news, [[Entertainment]], [[Religious broadcasting]], and cultural content.[161][32]
[[Association football]] is Goma's most popular sport.
Prominent football clubs in the city include [[AS Dauphins Noirs]], which competes in [[Linafoot]], the premier division of the [[Congolese Association Football Federation]].[190][191][192] Other significant clubs include [[DC Virunga]] and [[AS Kabasha]], both of which participate in [[Linafoot Ligue 2]], an annual competition involving amateur football clubs across the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[193][194][195] Matches for these clubs are predominantly held at [[Stade de l'Unité]], the city's primary football venue.[196][197][198] Goma also has several other notable sports facilities, including Stade Mugunga,[199][200] [[Stade des Volcans]],[201][202] and Stade Afia.[203]
In addition to football, Goma is home to the Stade Paralympique de Goma, a dedicated [[Basketball]] stadium that hosts national [[Wheelchair basketball]] championships.[204][205][206]
[[Boxing]] also plays a significant role in Goma's sports culture, with the city hosting a variety of boxing events, including inter-regional boxing tournaments at the Higher Institute of Commerce of Goma (Institut supérieur de Commerce de Goma; ISC-Goma).[207] In 2015, Goma served as the host city for an inter-regional boxing tournament organized by the brewing company Brasimba of [[Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], which attracted both amateur and professional pugilists from Goma, [[Bukavu]], Beni, [[Butembo]], and [[Rwanda]].[207] On 30 June 2024, Goma hosted a Boxing Gala organized by the North Kivu Boxing League to commemorate the nation's independence, featuring participants from North Kivu, [[South Kivu]], and [[Maniema]].[208]
Goma is home to several Christian churches and temples including the churches of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Goma]], [[Kimbanguism]], [[Baptist Community of Congo]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), the Baptist Community in the Center of Africa (World Baptist Alliance), [[Assemblies of God]], [[Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), Presbyterian Community in Congo ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).
There are also Muslim [[Mosque]].[209]
Goma's economy relies mainly on [[Agriculture]], with a significant proportion of its population engaged in the trade of [[Agricultural productivity]].
However, due to the instability of the local currency, economic transactions often involve foreign currencies.[210] Primarily centered on the production of [[Raw material]], including plant agriculture, [[Fishing]], [[Hunting]], and [[Fish farming]], these activities typically employ artisanal methods and antiquated production techniques.
Agricultural products are primarily sourced from neighboring territories such as [[Masisi Territory]] and [[Rutshuru Territory]], supplemented by the resources of [[Lake Kivu]], which hosts thriving [[Fish market]] along its shores twice a week.[210] Cultivation primarily focuses on garden crops and selected [[Staple food]] such as [[Legume]], [[Maize]], and [[Tuber]], leveraging the fertile volcanic soil enriched by [[Basalt]] substrata.
Nevertheless, the dense population necessitates [[Economic diversification]] to ensure [[Food security]] and foster interdependence with neighboring territories and countries for supplementary yields.[210]
Historically, the colonial administration catalyzed economic development by introducing [[Plantation]] agriculture in North Kivu's fertile highlands, establishing the region as a critical "food basket" for the [[Belgian Congo]].[211] Legislative frameworks, including the Draft Decree and Royal Decree of 12 December 1939, laid the foundation for agricultural oversight.
This initiative culminated in the establishment of OPAC (Office des Produits Agricoles de Costermansville) on 4 February 1948, subsequently renamed OPAK (Office des Produits Agricoles du Kivu; currently known as Office Nationale du Café, ONC).[212][32][213] These agencies oversaw the production and export of [[Cash crop]] such as [[Coffea arabica]] and [[Pyrethrum]].[212] During this era, substantial quantities of [[Cereal]], tubers, meat, and [[Palm oil]] were routed through Goma for redistribution to urban epicenters such as [[Kinshasa]] and [[Kisangani]].[211] The construction of a port in Keshero, later repositioned nearer to central Goma, augmented [[Trade route]], integrating the city into a north-south [[Economic corridor]] extending through [[Bunia]], Rutshuru, [[Bukavu]], [[Uvira]], and [[Kalemie]].[211] While the colonial economy also invested in resource extraction, North Kivu's mining sector remained underdeveloped relative to mineral-rich regions like [[Ituri Province]] and [[South Kivu]].[211] Consequently, Goma's prominence as a mineral trading hub was relatively subdued until the 1980s.
In the post-independence era, these historical trade networks gained significance as the local population increasingly relied on informal and transborder economic activities to circumvent the exploitative practices of the Zairean state.[211] By the 1980s, a substantial portion of agricultural production, including [[Papaya]], [[Tea]], [[Cinchona]], and coffee, was smuggled or exported through informal channels, with [[Goma International Airport]] playing a key role in this clandestine commerce.[211] Estimates from 1985–1986 suggest that up to 60% of local coffee production bypassed formal export systems.[211] In 2001, the Compagnie pour la Promotion des Activités Café (COOPAC) was established, headquartered in the Les Volcans neighborhood of the [[Goma (commune)]].[32] COOPAC has become a leading player in the coffee industry, overseeing coffee-related operations in eastern Congo and an integrated coffee processing chain, including a [[Husk]] facility established in 2004 and a washing station situated along the shores of Lake Kivu.[32] The city is also home to Maizeking, an industrial enterprise specializing in the manufacturing of products derived from [[Maize]], [[Sorghum]], [[Soybean]], and [[Wheat]].[214]
The [[Secondary sector of the economy]], though relatively underdeveloped, holds potential for growth, given the city's dense population, which provides abundant labor force and potentially mitigates production overheads for entrepreneurs.[210] Notable manufacturing enterprises include the MTC (Master Tabac Congo) conglomerate producing premium-grade [[Cigarette]], coffee processing factories like SOTRAKI and ONC as well as food production companies such as Au Bon Pain and Boulangerie Mont Carmel, which manufacture baked goods.[210] Other industrial entities include [[Nyiragongo Cement]], a [[Cement]] production facility; Mbinza, a [[Mattress]] manufacturing company; and La Chocolaterie Lowa, a Congolese [[Chocolate]] producer.[214][215][216] Additionally, the city has a growing bottled water industry and photographic processing facilities, such as Fujicolor.[210]
The [[Financial services]] is a significant component, with [[Bank]] and [[Non-bank financial institution]] serving the city's population.[210] Banking institutions like [[Central Bank of the Congo]], Banque Privée du Congo, [[Bank of Africa]], Banque Commerciale et de Développement, Banque Internationale de Crédit, Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Central, [[Equity Banque Commerciale du Congo]], [[Standard Bank]], First International Bank, [[Trust Merchant Bank]], [[Rawbank]], [[Afriland First Bank]], [[Access Bank plc]], [[Ecobank Group]] Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others provide financial services,[210][217] while non-banking institutions, including 17 microfinance organizations, fortified with credit components cater to various fiscal needs within the city.[218][210] Notably, microfinance entities like SOMIF/NFT, IMF Hekima, PAIDEK, Sociéte de Microcrédit Congolais, SOMIFI/REJEDE, COOPEC-Imara, COOPEC-Tumanini, and IMF PAIF, as well as NGOs like the Initiative Congolaise pour la Gestion Autonome des Populations (ICGP), the Association of Support for Grassroots Initiatives, Association d'Appui aux Initiatives de Base (APIBA), Organisation des Femmes pour le Développement (OFED), Solidarité et Fraternité dans l'Action, and Association de diabétiques du Congo (ADIC), contribute to economic development by supporting [[Small business]] and entrepreneurial ventures.[210] The city is also home to quasi-public non-bank financial institutions exemplified by Société Nationale d'Assurance (SONAS), Institution Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (INSS), Caisse Générale d'Épargne et de Crédit (CADECO), and [[Congolese Posts and Telecommunications Corporation]] (SCPT).[210]
Goma benefits from support organizations like [[United Nations Development Programme]], UWEKI, and CAFED, which foster entrepreneurship, provide training, and facilitate access to resources for local businesses.[210]
[[Aviation]] is a significant transport mode linking Goma with [[Domestic flight]] and [[International flight]] destinations.
[[Goma International Airport]], which serves as the city's principal gateway, handles passenger and cargo traffic and facilitates two international routes to [[Entebbe]] and [[Nairobi]], serviced by [[Ethiopian Airlines]] and [[Jambojet]].[186] However, the aviation industry in Goma has changed over the years with the emergence and departure of various carriers.
While enterprises such as Virunga Air, Charter, and [[Sunair]] have ceased operations, stalwart aviation entities like société de Transports et Messageries au Kivu SARL (TMK), alongside [[Wimbi Dira Airways]] and [[Hewa Bora Airways]] persist in operating and rendering their services.[186]
[[Maritime transport]] is also an essential mode of transportation, connecting Goma with nearby cities like [[Bukavu]] in the [[South Kivu]].
Boats and ferries operated by companies such as the [[Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo]] (SNCC) and private operators like Rafiki and Ihusi Hotel facilitate the movement of people and [[Merchandise]] goods across Lake Kivu.[219][186] Notably, boats such as Emmanuel 2, assembled locally, provide an alternative mode of transport, significantly reducing travel time compared to road travel.[220]
[[Road transport]], presided over by private operators, is vital for intra-city and inter-city travel, encompassing a network of paved and unpaved routes.[186][183] [[National Road 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] bisects the urban landscape, supplemented by smaller road segments, though their cumulative length is at most three kilometers.[183] The city's road transport system comprises various vehicles, including car, trucks, buses and motorcycles, with car and motorcycle taxis facilitating the majority of shuttle services.[183] Car taxis, often referred to as city taxis, are predominantly used for [[Passenger transport]], while luggage taxis cater to the movement of goods.
Motorcycle taxis, commonly employed for both passenger and small package deliveries, play a vital role in local mobility.[183] Goma's location on the Rwandan border ensures its connectivity to [[Gisenyi]], with regular bus services facilitating travel between Goma and [[Kigali]] in less than four hours.[186] Goma's road network connects to [[Masisi, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Walikale]], [[Kisangani]], [[Rutshuru]], [[Butembo]], [[Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Kasindi]], [[Bunia]], and [[Bukavu]], among other destinations.
Goma is a four member [[Electoral district]] of the 2024–2029 [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the deputies are:[222]
Goma's education system is organized into three main levels: [[Kindergarten]], for children aged 3 to 5; [[Primary school]], designed for students aged 6 to 12; and [[Secondary school]], which accommodates teenagers aged 12 to 18.[32] Beyond [[Basic education]], Goma serves as an academic hub for [[Tertiary education]], hosting several prestigious institutions governed by the Ministry of Higher and University Education (Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et Universitaire, ESU).[209][235] The city is home to two of the nation's best universities: the [[Free University of the Great Lakes Countries]] (ULPGL) and the [[University of Goma]].[236] In 2016, ULPGL achieved second place nationally according to International Colleges and Universities and third place in the [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]] ranking, which positioned it 19,099th globally.[237]
Since early 2019, violent crimes such as [[Murder]], [[Robbery]], and [[Kidnapping]] have plagued outlying neighborhoods, notably Ndosho and Mugunga in [[Karisimbi (commune)]].[239] Ndosho, known for its bustling [[Marketplace]] and [[Brothel]], is characterized by high crime rates and [[Ethnic conflict]], while Mugunga, predominantly populated by [[Hutu]], formerly hosted extensive refugee camps in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan genocide]], alongside sizable IDPs settlements during periods of heightened conflict between the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (and subsequently [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)]]) and the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013.[239] Although the camps have been dismantled, the neighborhood is characterized by a high number of former IDPs ([[Hunde people]] and Hutu) who settled in Mugunga.
Both neighborhoods border [[Virunga National Park]] to the north and the main road to [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the south, dividing the [[Goma (commune)]] and [[Karisimbi (commune)]] communes, with diurnal activities centered along this road.[239]
A significant number of Mugunga's inhabitants, including [[Brigandage]] and maibobo ([[Street children]]), gravitate towards Ndosho during daylight hours, lured by its superior commercial prospects.
Throughout the day, encounters with insecurity primarily revolve around [[Pickpocketing]], [[Extortion]] by maibobo, [[Gang]]-related [[Harassment]], and coercive measures employed by security personnel in Ndosho.[239] Brigandage and petty crime have evolved into a viable means of subsistence for many and are part of an urban economy of survival and enrichment.
Pilfered [[Merchandising]] goods are openly sold in the markets, with numerous criminals attaining notoriety within their neighborhoods and certain gang leaders achieving city-wide renown.[239] During the night, security conditions worsen and become more violent.
Most residents return to their homes, while mixed patrols of the [[Congolese National Police]] (PNC) and Police Militaire (PM) units, along with gangs, prowl around the streets.
Without [[Pedestrian]] [[Traffic]] and under the cloak of darkness, it becomes easier for bandits, thieves, and even unscrupulous police and military officers to operate.[239]
The regional conflict surrounding coltan and other lucrative resources has compounded Goma's challenges with crime.[240] Armed groups, including the [[Rwanda Defence Force]], the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]], and various opposition factions, have been implicated in the systemic targeting of civilians as they vied for dominion over resource-abundant zones.[241] During 2000 and 2001, RCD-Goma forces reportedly conducted a spate of violent incursions into residences, particularly targeting individuals engaged in the [[Coltan]] trade.
Notably, on 18 November 2000, armed men, including RCD-Goma combatants, attacked the residence of Edouard Kasereka Kahimba, a coltan buyer.[241] The assailants demanded [[Business record]] and coltan, injuring Kahimba and assaulting his family members.[241] On 29 December 2000, combatants reportedly targeted a coltan trader known as "Safro" Sanvura, ransacking his residence and shooting indiscriminately.
Goma hosts the [[Free University of the Great Lakes Countries]], which supports local development initiatives.[242][243]
The [[Goma International Airport]] accepts commercial charter flights and also, passenger flights operated by Ethiopian Airlines and Jambojet travel to [[Addis Ababa]] and Nairobi.[244]
Goma has four or five lakeside wharves totaling about 130 m (430 ft), the longest being about 80 m (260 ft).
As of 2014, an art gallery had opened, featuring local woodcarving, painting, and [[Puppets]].[245]
Goma hosts a Catholic priest seminary Redemptoris Mater run by the [[Neocatechumenal Way]].[246]
Goma is [[Sister city]] with:
[[Peter Cirimwami Nkuba]] Congolese military governor of the province of North Kivu until his death during [[M23 campaign (2022–present)]] at the hands of [[M23]] the and [[Rwandan Defence Force]]
