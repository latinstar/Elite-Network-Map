The Colony of Virginia was a [[British Empire]] colonial settlement in North America from 1606 to 1776.
The first effort to create an English settlement in the area was chartered in 1584 and established in 1585; the resulting [[Roanoke Colony]] lasted for three attempts totaling six years.
But nearly 20 years later, the colony was re-settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], not far north of the original site.
A second charter was issued in 1606 and settled in 1607, becoming the first enduring [[English colonial empire]] in North America.
It followed failed attempts at settlement on [[Newfoundland (island)]] by Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]][4] in 1583 and the Roanoke Colony (in modern eastern [[North Carolina]]) by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in the late 1580s.
The founder of the Jamestown colony was the [[Virginia Company]],[5] chartered by [[James VI and I]], with its first two settlements being in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] on the north bank of the [[James River]] and [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]] in modern-day [[Maine]], both in 1607.
Jamestown occupied land belonging to the [[Tsenacommacah]]; it was also on the brink of failure before the arrival of a new group of settlers and supplies by ship in 1610.
[[Tobacco]] became Virginia's first profitable export, the production of which had a significant impact on the society and settlement patterns.
In 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I, and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a [[Crown colony]].
After the [[English Civil War]] in the 1640s and 1650s, the Virginia colony was nicknamed "The Old Dominion" by King [[Charles II of England]] for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Protectorate and [[Commonwealth of England]].[6]
From 1619 to 1775/1776, the colonial legislature of Virginia was the General Assembly, which governed in conjunction with [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]].
Jamestown remained the capital of the Virginia Colony until 1699; from 1699 until its dissolution, the capital was in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].
The colony experienced its first significant political turmoil with [[Bacon's Rebellion]] of 1676.
After declaring independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1775, before the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was officially adopted, the Virginia Colony became the [[Virginia]], one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] of the United States, adopting as its official slogan "The Old Dominion".
The entire modern states of [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]], and portions of [[Ohio]], [[Western Pennsylvania]] and [[Minnesota]] were later created from the territory encompassed, or claimed by, Virginia during the [[American Revolutionary War]].
In 1584, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] sent [[Philip Amadas]] and [[Arthur Barlowe]] to explore what is now the [[North Carolina]] coast.
They returned with word of a regional king ([[Weroance]]) named [[Wingina]], who ruled a land supposedly called Wingandacoa.
"Virginia" was originally a term used to refer to England's entire North American possession and claim along the east coast from the [[34th parallel north]] (close to [[Cape Fear (headland)]]) north to the [[45th parallel north]].
This area included a large section of Canada and the shores of [[Acadia]].[7]
The name Virginia for a region in North America may have been originally suggested by Raleigh, who named it for [[Elizabeth I]] in approximately 1584.[8] In addition, the term Wingandacoa may have influenced the name Virginia.[9][10] On his next voyage, Raleigh learned that while the chief of the [[Secotan]] was indeed called Wingina, the expression wingandacoa heard by the English upon arrival actually meant "What good clothes you wear!" in [[Carolina Algonquian]] and was not the name of the country as previously misunderstood.[11]
According to tradition, in gratitude for the loyalty of Virginians to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], [[Charles II of England]] gave it the title of "Old Dominion".[14][15] The colony seal stated from Latin en dat virginia quintum, in English 'Behold, Virginia gives the fifth', with Virginia claimed as the fifth English dominion after England, [[English claims to the French throne#The Stuart dynasty claimants]], [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]].
The Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] maintains "Old Dominion" as its [[List of U.S. state and territory nicknames]].
The athletic teams of the [[University of Virginia]] are known as the "[[Virginia Cavaliers]]", referring to [[Cavalier]] Charles II, and Virginia has a public university called "[[Old Dominion University]]".
Although Spain, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands all had competing claims to the region, none of these prevented the English from becoming the first European power to colonize successfully the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)]] coastline.
The Spanish had made earlier attempts in what is now Georgia ([[San Miguel de Gualdape]], 1526–1527; several [[Spanish missions in Georgia]] between 1568 and 1684), South Carolina ([[Santa Elena (Spanish Florida)]], 1566–1587), North Carolina ([[Joara]], 1567–1568) and Virginia ([[Ajacán Mission]], 1570–1571); and by the French in South Carolina ([[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site]], 1562–1563).
Farther south, the Spanish colony of [[Spanish Florida]], centered on [[St. Augustine, Florida]], was established in 1565, while to the north, the French were establishing settlements in what is now Canada ([[Charlesbourg-Royal]] briefly occupied 1541–1543; [[Port-Royal (Acadia)]], established in 1605).
In 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] established a charter in [[Newfoundland (island)]].
In 1585, Raleigh sent his [[Roanoke Colony]] to [[Roanoke Island]] (in present-day North Carolina) with over 100 male settlers.
However, when Sir [[Francis Drake]] arrived at the colony in the summer of 1586, the colonists opted to return to England because there was a lack of supply ships, abandoning the colony.
The expedition leader, [[John White (colonist and artist)]], returned to England for supplies that same year but was unable to return to the colony because of the war between England and Spain.
Although there are numerous theories about the fate of the colony, it remains a mystery and has come to be known as the [[Roanoke Colony]].
Two English children were born in this colony; the first was named [[Virginia Dare]] ([[Dare County, North Carolina]], was named in her honor), who was among those whose fate is unknown.
The word [[Croatan]] was found carved into a tree, the name of a tribe on a nearby island.[16]
King James granted a proprietary [[Charter]] to two competing branches of the Virginia Company, which investors supported.
These were the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[Virginia Company of London]].[17] By the terms of the charter, the Plymouth Company was permitted to establish a colony of 100 sq mi (260 km2) between the [[38th parallel north]] and the [[45th parallel north]] (roughly between [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the current U.S.–Canada border).
The London Company was permitted to establish between the [[34th parallel north]] and the [[41st parallel north]] (approximately between [[Cape Fear (headland)]] and [[Long Island Sound]]) and also owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada.
The London company formed [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in its exclusive territory, while the Plymouth company formed the [[Popham Colony]] in its exclusive territory near what is now Phippsburg, Maine.[18] The Popham colony quickly failed because of famine, disease, and conflicts with local Native American tribes in the first two years.
The London Company hired Captain [[Christopher Newport]] to lead its expedition.
On December 20, 1606, he set sail from England with his [[Flagship]], the [[Susan Constant]], and two smaller ships, the [[Godspeed (ship)]], and the [[Discovery (1602 ship)]], with 105 men and boys, plus 39 sailors.[19] After an unusually long voyage of 144 days, they arrived at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and came ashore at the point where the southern side of the bay meets the Atlantic Ocean, an event that has come to be called the "First Landing".
They erected a cross and named the point of land [[Cape Henry]] in honor of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of King James.[20]
They sailed westward into the Bay and reached the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]], stopping at a location now known as [[Old Point Comfort]].
Keeping the shoreline to their right, they then ventured up the largest river, which they named the [[James River]], for their king.
After exploring at least as far upriver as the confluence of the [[Appomattox River]] at present-day [[Hopewell, Virginia]], they returned downstream to [[Jamestown Island]], which offered a favorable defensive position against enemy ships and deep water anchorage adjacent to the land.
In addition to securing gold and other precious minerals to send back to the waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the [[Native Americans of the United States]].
Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the [[Jamestown supply missions]] during 1608 and leaving the Discovery for the colonists' use.
The [[Tsenacommacah]] was a [[Confederation]] of numerous linguistically related tribes in the eastern part of Virginia.
The Powhatan Confederacy controlled a territory known as Tsenacommacah, which roughly corresponded with the [[Tidewater (region)]] of Virginia.
At the time of the English arrival, the Powhatan were led by the [[Paramount chief]] Wahunsenacawh, known to the English as [[Powhatan (Native American leader)]].
On May 31, 1607, about 100 men and boys left England for what is now [[Maine]].
In 1609, with the abandonment of the Plymouth Company settlement, the London Company's Virginia charter was adjusted to include the territory north of the [[34th parallel north]] and south of the [[40th parallel north]], with its original coastal grant extended "from sea to sea".
The [[Sea Venture]] was designed to emit additional colonists and transport supplies.
It became the [[Flagship]] of the admiral of the convoy, Sir [[George Somers]].
Admiral Somers had the Sea Venture, carrying most of the mission's supplies, deliberately driven aground onto the reefs of [[Bermuda]] to avoid sinking.
However, while there was no loss of life, the ship was wrecked beyond repair, stranding its survivors on the uninhabited [[Archipelago]], to which they laid claim for England.[22]
Combined with drought and hostile relations with the [[Native Americans of the United States]], the loss of the supplies that had been aboard the Sea Venture resulted in the [[Starving Time]] in late 1609 to May 1610, during which over 80% of the colonists perished.
[[Samuel Argall]] was the captain of one of the seven ships of the third supply that arrived at Jamestown in 1609 after being separated from the Sea Venture, whose fate was unknown.
The king authorized another leader, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], later better known as "Lord Delaware", to have greater powers, and the London Company organized another supply mission.
The colonists thanked [[Divine providence]] for the colony's salvation.
He first sent [[Thomas Gates (governor)]] to drive off the Kecoughtan from their village on July 9, 1610, then gave Chief Powhatan an ultimatum to either return all English subjects and property, or face war.
Enraged, De la Warr had the hand of a [[Paspahegh]] captive cut off and sent him to the paramount chief with another ultimatum: Return all English subjects and property, or the neighboring villages would be burned.
On August 9, 1610, tired of waiting for a response from the Powhatan, West sent [[George Percy (governor)]] with 70 men to attack the Paspahegh capital, burning the houses and cutting down their cornfields.
This event triggered the first [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars]].
Among the individuals who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was [[John Rolfe]], a Sea Venture survivor who had lost his wife and son in Bermuda.
By 1612, Rolfe's strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first [[Cash crop]] for export.
[[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States]] and new outposts sprung up starting with [[Henricus]], initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area.
The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established.[26] A period of peace followed the marriage in 1614 of colonist Rolfe to [[Pocahontas]], the daughter of Chief Powhatan.
The relations with the [[Native American tribes in Virginia]] took a turn for the worse after the death of Pocahontas in England and the return of Rolfe and other colonial leaders in May 1617.
After Chief Powhatan died in 1618, he was succeeded by his own younger brother, [[Opechancanough]].
On the surface, he maintained friendly relations with the English, negotiating with them through his warrior [[Nemattanew]].
Chief Opechancanough organized and led a well-coordinated [[Indian massacre of 1622]] on multiple English colonial settlements along both sides of a 50-mile (80 km) long stretch of the James River, which took place early on the morning of March 22, 1622.
The massacre caught most of the Virginia Colony by surprise and virtually wiped out several entire communities, including Henricus and [[Wolstenholme Towne]] at [[Martin's Hundred]].
Jamestown was spared from destruction because an Indian boy named [[Chanco]] learned of the planned attacks from his brother and warned colonist [[Richard Pace (planter)]] with whom he lived.
A year later, Captain [[William Tucker (Jamestown immigrant)]] and [[John Pott]] worked out a truce with the Powhatan and proposed a toast using liquor laced with poison.
For over a decade, the English settlers attacked the Powhatan, targeting their settlements as part of a [[Scorched earth]] policy.
By 1634, a six-mile-long [[Palisade]] was completed across the [[Virginia Peninsula]].
In 1620, a successor to the Plymouth Company sent colonists to the [[New World]] aboard the [[Mayflower]].
Known as [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)]], they successfully established a settlement in what became [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].
The portion of what had been Virginia north of the 40th parallel became known as [[New England]], according to books written by Captain [[John Smith (explorer)]], who had made a voyage there.
In 1624, the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked by King James I, and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority in the form of a [[Crown colony]].
Subsequent charters for the [[Province of Maryland]] in 1632 and to the eight [[Lord proprietor]] of the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1663 and 1665 further reduced the Virginia Colony to roughly the coastal borders it held until the [[American Revolution]].
(The border with North Carolina was disputed until surveyed by [[William Byrd II]] in 1728.)
In July, they marched against the [[Pamunkey]], [[Chickahominy people]], and [[Powhatan]] proper; and south of the James, against the [[Appomattoc]], [[Weyanoke people]], Warraskoyak, and [[Nansemond]], as well as two Carolina tribes, the [[Chowanoke]] and [[Secotan]].
In February–March 1645, the colony ordered the construction of four frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the [[Chickahominy River]], Fort Royal at the falls of the [[York River (Virginia)]] and [[Fort Henry (Virginia)]] at the falls of the [[Appomattox River]], where the modern city of [[Petersburg, Virginia]] is located.
In August 1645, the forces of Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)]] stormed Opechancanough's stronghold.
All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to [[Tangier, Virginia]].[28] Opechancanough, variously reported to be 92 to 100 years old, was taken to Jamestown.
In the peace treaty of October 1646, the [[Weroance]] [[Necotowance]] and the subtribes formerly in the confederacy each became tributaries to the King of England.
The extent of the Virginia Colony open to patent by English colonists was defined as: All the land between the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)]] and York rivers, and up to the navigable point of each of the major rivers – which were connected by a straight line running directly from modern Franklin on the Blackwater, northwesterly to the Appomattoc village beside Fort Henry, and continuing in the same direction to the [[Monacan (tribe)]] village above the falls of the James, where Fort Charles was built, then turning sharp right, to Fort Royal on the York (Pamunkey) river.
While the newer [[Puritan]] colonies, most notably [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], were dominated by [[Roundhead]], the older colonies sided with [[House of Stuart]].
The [[London Company]] two settlements, Virginia and [[Bermuda]] (Bermuda's Puritans were expelled as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]]), [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown and were singled out by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October 1650.
The act authorized Parliamentary [[Privateer]] to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies: "All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized.
Virginia's population swelled with [[Cavalier]] during and after the [[English Civil War]].
Under the tenure of [[List of colonial governors of Virginia#Crown Governors (1624–1652)]] [[William Berkeley (governor)]] (1642–1652; 1660–1677), the population expanded from 8,000 in 1642 to 40,000 in 1677.[30] Despite the resistance of the [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)]], Virginian Puritan [[Richard Bennett (governor)]] was made governor answering to [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1652, followed by two more nominal "commonwealth governors".
Nonetheless, the colony was rewarded for its loyalty to the Crown by [[Charles II of England]] following the [[Stuart Restoration]] when he dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.
With the [[Restoration in the English colonies]] in 1660, the governorship returned to Berkeley.
In 1676, [[Bacon's Rebellion]] challenged the political order of the colony.
In 1679, the [[Treaty of 1677]] was signed between King Charles II and several Native American groups.
At the local level, [[Church of England]] parishes handled many local affairs, and they, in turn, were controlled not by the minister but rather by a closed circle of wealthy landowners who comprised the parish vestry.
However, it had a royal governor appointed by the king and a powerful [[Landed gentry]].
The status quo was strongly reinforced by what [[Thomas Jefferson]] called "feudal and unnatural distinctions" that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in Virginia.
He promoted laws such as [[Entail]] and [[Primogeniture]] by which the oldest son inherited all the land.
As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by enslaved Black people, gained in size, wealth, and political power in the eastern ("[[Tidewater (region)]]") tobacco areas.
Maryland and South Carolina had similar hierarchical systems, as did New York and Pennsylvania.[32] During the [[American Revolution]]ary era, all such laws were repealed by the new states.[33] The most fervent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)]] [[Expulsion of the Loyalists]].
They introduced primogeniture in [[Upper Canada]] in 1792, lasting until 1851.
As the English expanded out from Jamestown, encroachment of the new arrivals and their ever-growing numbers on what had been Indian lands resulted in several conflicts with the [[Native American tribes in Virginia]].
For much of the 17th century, English contact and conflict were mainly with the [[Algonquian peoples]] that populated the coastal regions, primarily the Powhatan Confederacy.
Following a series of wars and the decline of the Powhatan as a political entity, the colonists expanded westward in the late 17th and 18th centuries, encountering the [[Shawnee]], [[Iroquoian languages]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Nottoway people]], [[Meherrin]], [[Iroquois]] and [[Cherokee]], as well as [[Siouan languages]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Tutelo]], [[Saponi]], and [[Occaneechi]].
In the late 17th century, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] expanded into the western region of Virginia as part of the [[Beaver Wars]].
They arrived shortly before the English settlers and displaced the resident [[Siouan languages]].
[[Alexander Spotswood]] made further advances in policy with the Virginia Indians along the frontier.
In 1714, he established [[Fort Christanna]] to help educate and trade with several tribes with which the colony had friendly relations and to help protect them from hostile tribes.
In 1722, the [[Great Treaty of 1722]] was signed by leaders of the Five Nations of Iroquois, [[Province of New York]], Colony of Virginia, and [[Province of Pennsylvania]].
A few strategic outposts were constructed, including [[Fort Algernon]] (1609) at the entrance to the James River.
Early attempts to occupy strategic locations already inhabited by natives at what is now [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia]] failed owing to native resistance.
A short distance farther up the James, in 1611, [[Thomas Dale]] began the construction of a progressive development at [[Henricus]] on and about what was later known as [[Farrar's Island]].
In addition to creating the settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia]], as well as [[City Point, Virginia]] in 1613, now part of [[Hopewell, Virginia]].
He began the excavation work at [[Dutch Gap Canal]], using methods he had learned while serving in [[Holland]].
Once tobacco had been established as an export [[Cash crop]], investors became more interested, and groups of them united to create largely self-sufficient "[[Hundred (county division)]]." The term "hundred" is a traditional English name for an administrative division of a [[Shire]] (or [[County (United States)]]) to define an area that would support one hundred heads of household.[35] In the colonial era in Virginia, the "hundreds" were large developments of many acres, necessary to support tobacco crops.
An example was [[Martin's Hundred]], located downstream from Jamestown on the north bank of the James River.
It was settled in 1618, and [[Wolstenholme Towne]] was its administrative center, named for [[John Wolstenholme (merchant)]], one of the investors.
[[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia]] (now in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]) and [[Flowerdew Hundred]] (now in [[Prince George County, Virginia]]) are other names which have survived over centuries.
Others included [[Berkeley Hundred]], Bermuda Nether Hundred, Bermuda Upper Hundred, [[Smith's Hundred]], Digges Hundred, West Hundred, and Shirley Hundred (and, in Bermuda, Harrington Hundreds).
These were [[Charles City (Virginia Company)]], [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)]], [[Henrico City (Virginia Company)]], and [[James City (Virginia Company)]], which included the relatively small seat of government for the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]].
Each of the four "citties" (sic) extended across the [[James River (Virginia)]], the main conduit of transportation of the era.
Elizabeth Cittie, known initially as [[Kecoughtan, Virginia]] (a Native word with many variations in spelling by the English), also included the areas now known as [[South Hampton Roads]] and the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]].
In 1630, under the governorship of [[John Harvey (Virginia governor)]], the first settlement on the [[York River (Virginia)]] was founded.
In 1632, the Virginia legislature voted to build a fort to link Jamestown and the York River settlement of [[Kiskiack]] and protect the colony from Indian attacks.
In 1699, a capital was established and built at [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)]], soon renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].
In the period following the English Civil War, the exiled King Charles II hoped to shore up the loyalty of several of his supporters by granting them a significant area of mostly uncharted land to control as a [[Proprietary colony]] in Virginia (a claim that would only be valid were the king to return to power).
The grant was for the land between the [[Rappahannock River]] and [[Potomac River]] Rivers, which included the titular [[Northern Neck]], but as time went on, also would include all of what is today [[Northern Virginia]] and into West Virginia.
Due to ambiguities of the text of the various grants causing disputes between the proprietary and the colonial government, the tract was finally demarcated via the [[Fairfax Line]] in 1746.
From 1611 to 1618, under the orders of Sir Thomas Dale, the settlers of the colony were under a regime of civil law that became known as [[Dale's Code]].[36] Under a charter from the company in 1618, a new model of governance was put in place in 1619, which created a [[House of Burgesses]].[36] On July 30, 1619, burgesses met at [[Jamestown Church]] as the first elected representative legislative assembly in the New World.[36] The legal system in the colony was thereafter based on the provisions of its royal charter and English [[Common law]].
The capital of Virginia remained in Williamsburg until it was moved further inland to [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1779 during the American Revolution.
While no gold was found, various products were sent back, including pitch and [[Clapboard]].
In 1608, early attempts were made at breaking the [[Continental Europe]] hold on glassmaking through the [[Jamestown Glasshouse]].
In 1619, the colonists built the [[Falling Creek Ironworks]].
As the English increasingly used tobacco products, the production of [[Tobacco in the American colonies]] became a significant economic driver, especially in the tidewater region surrounding the Chesapeake Bay.
From 1616 to 1619, the only exports of the colony were tobacco and [[Sassafras albidum]].[37]
Planters would have their workers fill large [[Hogshead]] with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses.
In 1730, the Virginia House of Burgesses standardized and improved the quality of tobacco exported by establishing the [[Tobacco Inspection Act]] of 1730, which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations.
In 1608, the first [[Polish people]] and [[Slovaks]] arrived as part of a group of skilled [[Artisan]].[40][41][42][43] In 1619, the [[First Africans in Virginia]] arrived.
Many more Africans were imported as enslaved people, such as [[Angela (enslaved woman)]].[44] In the early 17th century, French [[Huguenots]] arrived in the colony as refugees from religious warfare.[45]
In the early 18th century, indentured German-speaking colonists from the iron-working region of Nassau-Siegen arrived to establish the [[Germanna]] settlement.[46] Scots-Irish settled on the Virginia frontier.[47] Some Welsh arrived, including some ancestors of Thomas Jefferson.[48]
One method to solve the shortage was using [[Indentured servant]].
In 1640, [[John Punch (slave)]] was sentenced to lifetime servitude as punishment for trying to escape from his enslaver, [[Hugh Gwyn]].
One example is with [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)]], who argued with Robert Parker, another planter, over the status of [[John Casor]], formerly an indentured servant of his.
In the late 17th century, the [[Royal African Company]], which the King of England established to supply the great demand for labor to the colonies, had a monopoly on providing enslaved Africans to the colony.[51] As plantation agriculture was established earlier in Barbados, in the early years, enslaved people were shipped from Barbados (where they were seasoned) to the colonies of Virginia and Carolina.
In 1619, the [[Anglican Church]] was formally [[Established church]] as the official Christian religion in the colony and would remain so until shortly after the American Revolution.
All 26 churches with [[Church service]] in Virginia in 1650 were Anglican, which included all but 4 of the 30 Anglican churches in the colonies at the time (with the remainder located in [[Province of Maryland]]).[56] Following the [[First Great Awakening]] (1730–1755), the number of regular places of worship in Virginia grew to 126 in 1750 (96 Anglican, 17 [[Presbyterianism in the United States]], 5 [[Lutheranism]], 5 [[Reformed Church in the United States]], and 3 [[Baptists in the United States]]),[57] with the colony gaining an additional 251 regular places of worship to a total of 377 by 1776 (101 Baptist, 95 Presbyterian, 94 Episcopal, 42 [[Quakers]], 17 Lutheran, 14 German Reformed, 10 [[History of Methodism in the United States]], 2 [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], and 2 [[Mennonite Church (1683–2002)]]).[58]
The first [[Printing press]] used in Virginia began operation in Jamestown on June 8, 1680, though within a few years, it was shut down by the Governor and Crown of England for want of a license.[59] It was not until 1736 that the first newspaper, the [[Virginia Gazette]], began circulation under printer [[William Parks (publisher)]] of Williamsburg.[59]
The [[Syms-Eaton Academy]], started in 1634, became America's first free public school.
In 1693, the [[College of William & Mary]] was founded at Middle Plantation (soon renamed Williamsburg).
After 1747, some Virginians began to attend institutions at [[Princeton University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]].
First, what would become [[Hampden–Sydney College]] was founded in 1775, before the American Revolution.
Likewise, Augusta Academy was a classical school that would evolve into [[Washington and Lee University]] (though it would not grant its first bachelor's degree until 1785).
