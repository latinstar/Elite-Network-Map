Historians and political scientists rank Obama highly in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary]].
Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[3] at [[Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children]] in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii.[4][5][6][7] He is the only president born outside the [[Contiguous 48 states]].[8] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father.
His mother, [[Ann Dunham]] (1942–1995), was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent.
In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of [[Moneygall]] to the U.S. in 1850.[9] In July 2012, [[Ancestry.com]] found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from [[John Punch (slave)]], an enslaved African man who lived in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the seventeenth century.[10][11][12] Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as [[Scotch-Irish Americans]] mostly.[13] Obama's father, [[Barack Obama Sr.]] (1934–1982),[14] was a married[15][16][17] [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania]] from [[Nyang'oma Kogelo]].[15][18] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[19] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]], where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[20][21] The couple married in [[Wailuku, Hawaii]], on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[22][23]
In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], where they lived for a year.
He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at [[Harvard University]], where he earned a [[Master of Arts]] in economics.
Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[24] Obama Sr. returned to [[Kenya]] in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[25][page needed] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[26] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[27] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind."[21] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[28]
In 1963, Dunham met [[Lolo Soetoro]] at the [[University of Hawaiʻi]]; he was an Indonesian [[East–West Center]] graduate student in geography.
The couple married on [[Molokai]] on March 15, 1965.[29] After two one-year extensions of his [[J-1 visa]], Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966.
The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the [[Tebet, South Jakarta]] district of [[South Jakarta]].
From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the [[Menteng]] district of [[Central Jakarta]].[30]
From age six to ten, he was registered in school as "Barry"[31] and attended local [[Indonesian-language]] schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and [[State Elementary School Menteng 01]] (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language [[Calvert School]] homeschooling by his mother.[32][33] As a result of his four years in [[Jakarta]], he was able to speak [[Indonesian language]] fluently as a child.[34] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him "a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works".[35]
In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, [[Madelyn Dunham]] and [[Stanley Armour Dunham]].
He attended [[Punahou School]]—a private [[College preparatory school]]—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[36] In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname "Barry" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[37] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, [[Maya Soetoro]], in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in [[Anthropology]] at the University of Hawaii.[38] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[39] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for [[Ovarian cancer]] and [[Uterine cancer]].[40]
Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."[41] Obama has also written and talked about using [[Alcohol (drug)]], [[Marijuana]], and [[Cocaine]] during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind".[42] Obama was also a member of the "Choom Gang" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.[43][44]
After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend [[Occidental College]] on a full scholarship.
In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the [[Disinvestment from South Africa]] in response to that nation's policy of [[Apartheid]].[45] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in [[Pakistan]] for three weeks.[45] Later in 1981, he [[College transfer]] to [[Columbia University]] in New York City as a [[Junior (education year)]], where he majored in [[Political science]] with a specialty in [[International relations]][46] and in [[English literature]][47] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[48] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 [[Grading (education)#United States]].
After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the [[Business International Corporation]], where he was a financial researcher and writer,[49][50] then as a project coordinator for the [[New York Public Interest Research Group]] on the [[City College of New York]] campus for three months in 1985.[51][52][53]
Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the [[Developing Communities Project]], a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in [[Roseland, Chicago]], [[West Pullman]], and [[Riverdale, Chicago]] on Chicago's [[South Side, Chicago]].
He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[52][54] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in [[Altgeld Gardens Homes (Chicago, Illinois)]].[55] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the [[Gamaliel Foundation]], a community organizing institute.[56] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in [[Europe]] for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his [[Jael Obama]] for the first time.[57][58]
Despite being offered a full scholarship to [[Northwestern University School of Law]], Obama enrolled at [[Harvard Law School]] in the fall of 1988, living in nearby [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].[60] He was selected as an editor of the [[Harvard Law Review]] at the end of his first year,[61] president of the journal in his second year,[55][62] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar [[Laurence Tribe]] while at Harvard.[63] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a [[Associate attorney#Summer associates]] at the law firms of [[Sidley Austin]] in 1989 and [[Hopkins & Sutter]] in 1990.[64] Obama's election as the [[List of African-American firsts]] gained national media attention[55][62] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[65] which evolved into a personal memoir.
The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as [[Dreams from My Father]].[65] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a [[Juris Doctor]] [[Latin honors]].[66][61]
In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] to work on his first book.[65][67] He then taught [[Constitutional law]] at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[68]
From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's [[Project Vote]], a [[Voter registration campaign]] with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading [[Crain's Chicago Business]] to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.[69]
In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of [[Family of Barack Obama]]: "It's like a little mini-United Nations," he said.
"I've got relatives who look like [[Bernie Mac]], and I've got relatives who look like [[Margaret Thatcher]]."[70] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living.[71] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[72] until her death on November 2, 2008,[73] two days before his election to the presidency.
Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in [[Moneygall]] in May 2011.[74] In [[Dreams from My Father]], Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of [[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].
Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]], among others.[75][76][77]
Obama lived with anthropologist [[Sheila Miyoshi Jager]] while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[78] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[78][79] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[79]
In June 1989, Obama met [[Michelle Robinson]] when he was employed at [[Sidley Austin]].[80] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[81] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[82] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent [[In vitro fertilization]] to conceive their children.[83] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[84] followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001.[85] The Obama daughters attended the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]].
When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the [[Sidwell Friends School]].[86] The Obamas had two [[Portuguese Water Dog]]; the first, a male named [[Bo (dog)]], was a gift from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].[87] In 2013, Bo was joined by [[Sunny (dog)]], a female.[88] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[89]
Obama is a supporter of the [[Chicago White Sox]], and he threw out the first pitch at the [[2005 ALCS]] when he was still a senator.[90] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] while wearing a White Sox jacket.[91] He is also primarily a [[Chicago Bears]] football fan in the [[NFL]], but in his childhood and adolescence was a [[Steeler Nation]] and rooted for them ahead of their victory in [[Super Bowl XLIII]] 12 days after he took office as president.[92] In 2011, Obama invited the [[1985 Chicago Bears]] to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their [[Super Bowl XX]] in 1986 due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]].[93] He plays [[Basketball]], a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,[94] and he is left-handed.[95]
In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.6 million in 2024) in neighboring [[Kenwood, Chicago]].[96] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend [[Tony Rezko]]—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[97]
In December 2007, [[Money Magazine]] estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $2 million in 2024).[98] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[99][100] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to [[Fisher House Foundation]], a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[101][102] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[103]
Obama is a [[Protestant]] Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[104] He wrote in [[The Audacity of Hope]] that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ...
I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for [[Secular humanism]]." He described his father as a "confirmed [[Atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[Black church]] as a [[Community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."[105]
In January 2008, Obama told [[Christianity Today]]: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian.
I believe in the [[Redeemer (Christianity)]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ]].
So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of [[Jesus Christ]] spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, [[Golden Rule]].[107][108]
Obama met [[Trinity United Church of Christ]] pastor [[Jeremiah Wright]] in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[109] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after [[Jeremiah Wright controversy]].[110] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including [[Shiloh Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)]] and [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square]], as well as Evergreen Chapel at [[Camp David]], but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[111][112][113]
I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times." The items, "a whole bowl full", include rosary beads given to him by [[Pope Francis]], a figurine of the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]], a [[Coptic cross]] from Ethiopia, a small [[Buddha statue]] given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.[114][115]
From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the [[Woods Fund of Chicago]]—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the [[Joyce Foundation]].[52] He served on the board of directors of the [[Chicago Annenberg Challenge]] from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[52] Obama's law license became inactive in 2007.[116][117]
Obama was elected to the [[Illinois Senate]] in 1996, succeeding Democratic state senator [[Alice Palmer (politician)]] from [[Illinois's 13th Senate district]], which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to [[South Shore, Chicago]] and west to [[Chicago Lawn]].[118] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[119][120] He sponsored a law that increased [[Tax credit]] for low-income workers, negotiated [[Welfare reform]], and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[121] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican governor [[George Ryan]]'s [[Payday loan]] regulations and [[Predatory mortgage lending]] regulations aimed at averting home [[Foreclosure]].[122][123]
He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[124][125] In 2000, he lost a [[2000 Illinois's 1st congressional district election]] for [[Illinois's 1st congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] to four-term incumbent [[Bobby Rush]] by a margin of two to one.[126]
In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[127] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor [[Racial profiling]] by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[121][128][129][130] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting [[Capital punishment in the United States]] reforms.[131] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[132]

Decisions by Republican incumbent [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)]] and his Democratic predecessor [[Carol Moseley Braun]] not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[139] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[140] In July 2004, Obama delivered [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]],[141] seen by nine million viewers.
Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner [[Jack Ryan (politician)]], withdrew from the race in June 2004.[143] Six weeks later, [[Alan Keyes]] accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[144] In the [[2004 United States Senate election in Illinois]], Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history.[145] He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not perform well.[146]
Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[147] becoming the only Senate member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].[148] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] concept to conventional weapons;[149] and the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]], which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[150] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators [[Tom Carper]], [[Tom Coburn]], and [[John McCain]]—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[151] He also [[Sponsor (legislative)]] the [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act]].[152]

Numerous candidates entered the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].
The field narrowed to Obama and Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but Obama gained a steady lead in pledged [[Delegate (American politics)]] due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in [[Caucus]] states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[171]

In his first few days in office, Obama issued [[Executive order]] and [[Presidential memoranda]] directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[202] He ordered the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]],[203] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[204][205] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee.[206] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[207] He also revoked President George W.
Bush's restoration of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Mexico City policy]] which prohibited federal aid to international [[Family planning]] organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[208]
The first bill signed into law by Obama was the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]], relaxing the [[Statute of limitations]] for equal-pay lawsuits.[209] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children.[210] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of [[Embryonic stem cell]] research and pledged to develop "strict guidelines" on the research.[211]
He nominated [[Sonia Sotomayor]] on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] [[David Souter]].
She was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[212] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of [[Hispanic]] descent.[213] Obama nominated [[Elena Kagan]] on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]].
On March 11, 2009, Obama created the [[White House Council on Women and Girls]], which formed part of the [[Office of Intergovernmental Affairs]], having been established by [[Executive order]] 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.
The council was chaired by [[Senior Advisor to the President]] [[Valerie Jarrett]].
Obama also established the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]] through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.
The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and [[Office of the Vice President of the United States]], and prior to that the 1994 [[Violence Against Women Act]] first drafted by Biden.
In July 2009, Obama launched the [[Priority Enforcement Program]], an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W.
Bush, and the [[Secure Communities]] fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.[215]
In a [[Space policy of the Obama administration]] in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at [[NASA]], the U.S. space agency.
He ended plans for a return of [[Human spaceflight]] to the moon and development of the [[Ares I]] rocket, [[Ares V]] rocket and [[Constellation program]], in favor of funding [[Earth science]] projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the [[International Space Station]].[216]
On January 16, 2013, one month after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding [[Gun politics in the United States]].[217] He urged Congress to reintroduce an [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] on military-style [[Assault weapons]], such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] for the first time since 2006.[218] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[219] In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed "common-sense gun reform" to [[Women's suffrage]] and other [[Civil rights movements]] in American history.
In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[220] Following the [[2013 global surveillance disclosures]] by [[Whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]], Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[221] but called for increased restrictions on the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to address violations of privacy.[222][223] Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W.
Bush, while implementing some reforms.[224] He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC).[224]
Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a "[[Post-racial America]]".[228][229] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent,[228][230] and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.[231] The [[Trial of George Zimmerman]] of [[George Zimmerman]] following the [[Killing of Trayvon Martin]] sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."[232] The shooting of [[Shooting of Michael Brown]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], [[Ferguson unrest]].[233] These and other events led to the birth of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, which campaigns against violence and [[Systemic racism]] toward [[Black people]].[233] Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.[234]
On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], a measure that expanded the [[Hate crime laws in the United States#Federal]] to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[237] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV.
The lifting of the ban was celebrated by [[Immigration Equality]].[238] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[239][240] to end the [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the [[United States Armed Forces]].
In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred [[Transgender personnel in the United States military]].[241]
As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]].[242] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[243] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
I am not in favor of gay marriage."[244] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[245][246] During his second [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama]] on January 21, 2013,[201] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention [[LGBT rights in the United States]] or the word "gay" in an inaugural address.[247][248] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of [[Hollingsworth v.
Perry]] (regarding same-sex marriage)[249] and [[United States v.
Windsor]] (regarding the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]).[250]
On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], a $787 billion (equivalent to $1153 billion in 2024) [[Economic stimulus]] package aimed at helping the economy recover from the [[Great Recession]].[251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and [[Tax incentive]], and direct assistance to individuals.[252] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, [[Timothy Geithner]], took further steps to manage the [[2008 financial crisis]], including introducing the [[Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets]], which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.[253]
Obama intervened in the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–10]][254] in March 2009, renewing loans for [[General Motors]] (GM) and [[Chrysler]] to continue operations while reorganizing.
Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization]] to Italian automaker [[Fiat]][255] and a [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization]] giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.[256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[257] He signed into law the [[Car Allowance Rebate System]], known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", which temporarily boosted the economy.[258][259][260]
The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].
These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[261] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan [[Budget Control Act of 2011]].
The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.[262] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a [[U.S. government]] [[Default (finance)]] on its obligations.[263]
Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[264] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[265] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent,[266] decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.[267] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.[267] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.[268] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[268] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] said the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain".[269] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.[270]
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[272][273] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[273][274][275] while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."[272] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the [[National Association for Business Economics]] showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[276] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original [[NATO]] members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of [[World War II]].[277] The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.[278]
Within a month of the [[2010 midterm elections]], Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]], a one-year [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for [[Estate tax in the United States]].[279] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2024) [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[280]
In December 2013, Obama declared that growing [[Income inequality in the United States]] is a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages.
This came on the heels of the [[Fast food worker strikes]] and [[Pope Francis]]' criticism of inequality and [[Trickle-down economics]].[281] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].[282]
On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore [[Drilling rig]] at the [[Macondo Prospect]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], causing a [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].
Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ken Salazar]] and concurrent Congressional hearings.
He then announced a six-month moratorium on new [[Deepwater drilling]] permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[283] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[284] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and along the coast of [[Northern Alaska]] in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.[285]
In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions."[286][287] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[288] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[289]
In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the [[Atlantic]] and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.[290][291][292]
Obama emphasized the [[Conservation movement]] of [[Federal lands]] during his term in office.
He used his power under the [[Antiquities Act]] to create 25 new [[National monument (United States)]] during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[293][294][295]
Obama called for [[United States Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[Health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[296] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs.
His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[Public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care.
It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[Pre-existing condition]], and require every American to carry health coverage.
On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[296] After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009]] on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[300] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[301]
On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[302][303] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[304] On March 21, 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA, colloquially "Obamacare") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.
The ACA includes [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding [[Medicaid]] eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the [[Federal poverty level]] (FPL) starting in 2014,[306] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,[307] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing [[Health insurance exchange]], prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research.
The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income [[Tax bracket]], taxes on [[Indoor tanning]], cuts to the [[Medicare Advantage]] program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[310] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[311] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[312]
Sebelius]] that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[313] In [[Burwell v.
Hobby Lobby]] the Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives.
In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and [[United States Secretary of State]] Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a "new era" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms "break" and "[[Russian reset]]" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[315] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, [[Al Arabiya]].[316] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[317][318] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at [[Cairo University]] in Egypt calling for "[[A New Beginning (speech)]]" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[319] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following [[2009 Iranian presidential election]].[320]
In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], an American imam suspected of being a leading [[Al-Qaeda]] organizer.
al-Awlaki became the first [[U.S. citizen]] to be targeted and killed by a [[Drone strike]].
The Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war,[321] while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki's constitutional right to [[Due process]].
The killing led to significant controversy.[322] His [[Abdulrahman al-Awlaki]] and [[Death of Nawar al-Awlaki]], also Americans, were later killed in separate [[Raid on Yakla]], although they were not targeted specifically.[323][321]
In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], establishing a "Joint Planning Cell" with Saudi Arabia.[324][325] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of [[Saudi Arabia–United States relations]] worth $115 billion.[326] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to [[Saudi Arabia]] after Saudi warplanes [[2016 Sana'a funeral airstrike]] in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[327]
In September 2016 Obama was snubbed by [[Xi Jinping]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] as he descended from [[Air Force One]] to the tarmac of [[Hangzhou International Airport]] for the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit]] without the usual red carpet welcome.[328]
Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to [[Counter-terrorism]] and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[330][331] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[332] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be "home for the holidays."[333]
In June 2014, following the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)#Fall of Mosul and push into Kirkuk]] by [[ISIL]], Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant#Human rights abuse and war crime findings]].[334][335] In August 2014, during the [[Sinjar massacre]], Obama ordered a [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)#Airstrikes]].[336] By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[337] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[338] In early 2015, with the addition of the "Panther Brigade" of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400,[339] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[340]
McKiernan]], with former [[Special Forces (United States Army)]] commander Lt. Gen.
[[David Petraeus]] replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[346] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[347] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[348]
Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of [[Osama bin Laden]].
He was living in seclusion in [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad]] in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from [[Islamabad]].[350] CIA head [[Leon Panetta]] reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[350] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by [[United States Navy SEALs]].[350] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[351][352] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[353] which was buried at sea several hours later.[354] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's [[World Trade Center site]] and [[Times Square]].[351][355] [[Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden]] was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W.
Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and [[Vatican City]].[357] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to [[Exchange prisoners]] as a gesture of goodwill.[358] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President [[Raúl Castro]], in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the [[Death of Nelson Mandela]] in [[Johannesburg]].[359]
In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.[360] Popularly dubbed the [[Cuban Thaw]], [[The New Republic]] deemed the Cuban Thaw to be "Obama's finest foreign policy achievement."[361] On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and [[Havana]].[362] The countries' respective "interests sections" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[363] Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1928.[364]
During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the [[Joint Political Military Group]] and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[365] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the [[Iron Dome]] program in response to the waves of [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]].[366] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of [[East Jerusalem]].[367][368] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning [[Israeli settlement]], with the United States being the only nation to do so.[369] Obama supports the [[Two-state solution]] to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[370]
In 2013, [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] reported that, in Obama's view, "with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."[371] In 2014, Obama likened the [[Zionist movement]] to the [[Civil rights movement]] in the United States.
He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: "To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics."[372] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].[373] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the [[Iran Nuclear Deal]]; Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was "dangerous" and "bad."[374]
On December 23, 2016, under the Obama administration, the United States abstained from [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334]], which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[375] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions,[376][377] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[378] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[379][380]
In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as part of the [[Arab Spring]].
In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the [[Arab League]], and a resolution[381] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[382] In response to the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire.
On March 19, a multinational coalition led by France and the United Kingdom with Italian and U.S. support, approved by Obama, took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[384] including the use of [[Tomahawk missiles]], [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]], and fighter jets.[385][386][387] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed [[Operation Unified Protector]].[388] Some members of Congress[389] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[390][391] In 2016 Obama said "Our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind" and that it was "a mess".[392] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the "worst mistake" of his presidency.[393]
On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the [[Syrian civil war]], Obama issued a written statement that said: "The time has come for [[Bashar al-Assad]] to step aside."[394] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[395] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple [[Timber Sycamore]] and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[396] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[397][398]
In the wake of a [[Ghouta chemical attack]] in Syria, [[U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013]] by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the "red line" he had pledged[399] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad [[Destruction of Syria's chemical weapons]]; however attacks with [[Chlorine gas]] continued.[400][401] In 2014, Obama authorized an [[Military intervention against ISIL]].[402]
In November 2013, the Obama administration opened [[Negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] with Iran to prevent it from acquiring [[Nuclear weapon]], which included an [[Joint Plan of Action]].
The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the "effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions."[406] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded [[Hezbollah]] from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s [[Project Cassandra]] investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].[407][408]
On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[409]
In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to replace the [[START I]] with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[410] Obama and Medvedev signed the [[New START]] treaty in April 2010, and the [[U.S. Senate]] ratified it in December 2010.[411] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider [[LGBT rights]] when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[412] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against homosexual people,[413] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia.[414]
After [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014, [[Russian military intervention in Syria]] in 2015, and [[2016 United States election interference by Russia]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]],[415] [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen]], a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had "allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[416]
Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon [[First inauguration of Donald Trump]] of his successor, [[Donald Trump]].[417][418] The family moved to a house they rented in [[Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District]][419] On March 2, the [[John F.
Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] awarded the [[Profile in Courage Award]] to Obama "for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage."[420] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.[421] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.
Bush to work with [[One America Appeal]] to help the victims of [[Hurricane Harvey]] and [[Hurricane Irma]] in the [[Gulf Coast]] and [[Texas]] communities.[422] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the [[Obama Foundation]],[423] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[424]
Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for [[Netflix]] under the Obamas' newly formed production company, [[Higher Ground Productions]].[425][426] Higher Ground's first film, [[American Factory]], won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] in 2020.[427] On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service.
It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been [[October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts]].[428] In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on [[Martha's Vineyard]] from [[Wyc Grousbeck]].[429] On October 29, Obama criticized "[[Woke]]" and [[Call-out culture]] at the Obama Foundation's annual summit.[430][431]
Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]] because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee.[432] On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president, [[Joe Biden]], the presumptive nominee, for president in [[2020 United States presidential election]], stating that he has "all the qualities we need in a president right now."[433][434] In May, Obama criticized President Trump for [[Communication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic]] of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], calling his response to the crisis "an absolute chaotic disaster", and stating that the consequences of the [[First presidency of Donald Trump]] have been "our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before."[435] On November 17, Obama's presidential memoir, [[A Promised Land]], was released.[436][437][438]
Obama and his wife attended the [[Inauguration of Joe Biden]] in January 2021.
In February 2021, Obama and musician [[Bruce Springsteen]] started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about "their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'"[439][440] Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with [[Netflix]], in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[441]
On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land.[442] On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.[443][444][445] In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with [[Audible (service)]].[446][447] In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits.[448] Around the same time, he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator]][449] for his narration in the Netflix documentary series [[Our Great National Parks]].[450]
During the trip, Obama met with Australian prime minister [[Anthony Albanese]] and visited [[Melbourne]] for the first time.[452] Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.[453][454]
In October 2023, during the [[Gaza war]], Obama declared that [[Israel]] must dismantle [[Hamas]] in the wake of the [[Hamas-led attack on Israel]].[455] Weeks later, Obama warned [[Israel]] that its actions could "harden Palestinian attitudes for generations" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war's human costs "could ultimately backfire."[456]
In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden's campaign viability after his critically maligned [[Joe Biden–Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate]] against former president Trump.[457] On July 21, Biden [[Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election]] and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee.
Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a speech at the [[2024 Democratic National Convention]] formally endorsing her.[458] He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, senator, and vice president and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets.[459][460] After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President–elect [[JD Vance]] while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.[461]
Obama attended the [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump]] in January 2025.[462]
Obama's family history, upbringing, and [[Ivy League]] education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who rose to prominence in the 1960s through their involvement in the civil rights movement.[463] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] that "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."[464] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, remarking: "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."[465] Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator.[466] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly video addresses on [[YouTube]].[467]
According to the [[Gallup Organization]], Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent [[Approval rating]],[468] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in.[469] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009[470] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s,[471] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[472] Following the [[Death of Osama bin Laden]] on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.[473][474][475]
His approval rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011[476] before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent.[477] After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama's approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent[478] before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.[473] In polling conducted before the [[2014 midterm elections]], Obama's approval ratings were at their lowest[479][480] with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.[473][481][482] His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year.[473][483] According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.[473][484] In polling conducted January 16–19, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with [[George H.
Bush]] and [[Dwight D.
Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[489][490][491] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by [[Harris Insights & Analytics]] for [[France 24]] and the [[International Herald Tribune]], Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[492] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[493][494]
On October 9, 2009—only nine months into his first term—the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] announced that Obama had won the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples",[495] which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[496][497][498][499] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[500] He himself called it a "call to action" and remarked: "I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations".[501]
Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.[502][503][504] Historian [[Julian Zelizer]] credits Obama with "a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals." Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the [[Great Recession in the United States]] and the [[Dodd-Frank]] financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the [[Affordable Care Act]].
The [[Brookings Institution]] noted that Obama passed "only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions."[506] David W.
Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed.[508] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.[509] Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]] amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)]] and Medicaid in 1965.[510][511][512][513]
Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened [[Depression (economics)]] and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[508] According to the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the [[Obama administration]] created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.[514] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Passed as a response to the [[2008 financial crisis]], it brought the most significant changes to [[Financial regulation]] in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the [[Great Depression]] under Democratic President Franklin D.
In 2009, Obama signed into law the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010]], which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996.
The act expanded [[Hate crime laws in the United States]], and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[516]
As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[517] In 2010, he signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]], which brought an end to "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from [[LGBT]] people; the law went into effect the following year.[518] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on [[Transgender]] people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[519][241] A [[Gallup poll]], taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.[520]
Obama substantially escalated the use of [[Drone strikes]] against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the [[Taliban]].[521] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[522][523] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in [[Afghanistan]], 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[524]
According to [[Pew Research Center]] and [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent.
This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody of any president since [[Jimmy Carter]].
[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) called Obama's human rights record "mixed", adding that "he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed."[224]
The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned [[Presidential library system]].
It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in [[Jackson Park (Chicago)]] on the South Side of Chicago.[529]
Obama received the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]'s [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2009, [[USC Shoah Foundation]] in 2014, the [[John F.
Kennedy Profile in Courage Award]] in 2017, and the [[Robert F.
He was named [[Time (magazine)]]'s [[Time Person of the Year]] in 2008 and 2012.
He also received two [[Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording]] for [[Dreams from My Father]] (2006), and [[The Audacity of Hope]] (2008) as well as three [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator]] for [[Our Great National Parks]] (2022), Working: What We Do All Day (2023), and [[Our Oceans]] (2025).
He also won two [[Children's and Family Emmy Awards]].
In 2024 he became the first and so far only President from the [[Democratic Party of the United States]] to win the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]].
