Inside Job is a 2010 American [[Documentary film]], directed by [[Charles Ferguson (filmmaker)]], about the [[2008 financial crisis]].
Ferguson, who began researching in 2008,[3] said the film is about "the systemic corruption of the United States by the [[Financial services]] industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption",[4] amongst them conflicts of interest of academic research, which led to improved disclosure standards by the [[American Economic Association]].[5] In five parts, the film explores how changes in the policy environment and banking practices led to the [[2008 financial crisis]].
It was screened at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2010 and, on February 27, 2011, won [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].
The film begins by examining the effects of the government of [[Iceland]]'s shift toward [[Deregulation]] in 2000, which included the [[Privatization]] of its banks.
When [[Lehman Brothers]] went bankrupt and [[AIG]] collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession.
At the end of the 1980s, a [[Savings and loan crisis]] cost taxpayers approximately $124 billion.
In March 2000, the [[Dot-com bubble]] burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies they knew would fail, resulting in $5 trillion in investor losses.
In the 1990s, [[Derivative (finance)]] became popular in the industry and added instability.
Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], backed by several key officials.
In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks ([[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Bear Stearns]]), two financial conglomerates ([[Citigroup]], [[JPMorgan Chase]]), three [[Securitized]] insurance companies ([[AIG]], [[MBIA]], [[Ambac]]) and [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)]] rating agencies ([[Moody's]], [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings]]).
Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into [[Collateralized debt obligation]] (CDOs), which they sold to investors.
Rating agencies gave many CDOs [[Bond credit rating]].
[[Subprime loans]] led to [[Predatory lending]].
Speculators could buy [[Credit default swap]] (CDSs), which were akin to an insurance policy, to bet against CDOs they did not own.
There were some warnings about the growing risks in the financial system, including from [[Raghuram Rajan]], then the chief economist of the [[IMF]], who, at the [[Federal Reserve]]'s 2005 [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City#Economic policy symposium]], identified some risks and proposed policies to address them, though former [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Lawrence Summers]] called his warnings "misguided" and Rajan himself a "[[Luddite#In modern thought]]".
The [[Great Recession]] began in November 2007, and in March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash.
In September, the federal government took over [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], which had been on the brink of collapse.
Merrill Lynch, on the edge of collapse, was acquired by [[Bank of America]].
[[Henry Paulson]] and [[Timothy Geithner]] decided that Lehman must go into bankruptcy, which resulted in a collapse of the [[Commercial paper]] market.
The next day, Paulson and Fed chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] asked Congress for $700 billion to bail out the banks.
The [[Global financial system]] became paralyzed.
Bush]] signed the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], but global stock markets continued to fall.
Layoffs and foreclosures continued with unemployment rising to 10% in the US and the [[European Union]].
By December 2008, [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] also faced bankruptcy.
The executives had hand-picked their [[Boards of directors]], which handed out billions in bonuses after the government bailout.
Many academic economists who had advocated for deregulation for decades and helped shape U.S. policy still opposed reform following the [[2008 financial crisis]].
Firms involved were the [[Analysis Group]], [[Charles River Associates]], [[Compass Lexecon]], and the Law and Economics Consulting Group ([[LECG]]).
The incoming [[Obama administration]]'s financial reforms were weak, and there was no significant proposed regulation of the practices of ratings agencies, lobbyists, or executive compensation.
[[Martin Feldstein]], [[Laura Tyson]], and [[Lawrence Summers]] were all top economic advisers to Obama.
Bernanke was reappointed [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]].
On [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 98% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10; the site's "critics consensus" reads: "Disheartening but essential viewing, Charles Ferguson's documentary explores the 2008 Global Financial Crisis with exemplary rigor."[7] On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[Weighted average]] score of 88 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "universal acclaim",[8] and, in 2011, Jason Dietz of Metacritic ranked the film as the best film yet made about the "ongoing financial crisis".[9]
[[Roger Ebert]] described the film as "an angry, well-argued documentary about how the American housing industry set out deliberately to defraud the ordinary American investor".[10] [[A.
Scott]] of [[The New York Times]] wrote that "Mr. Ferguson has summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon.
That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good humor makes his case all the more devastating".[11]  Logan Hill of [[New York (magazine)]] magazine characterized the film as a "rip-snorting, indignant documentary", noting the "effective presence" of narrator [[Matt Damon]].[12] Peter Bradshaw of [[The Guardian]] said it was "as gripping as any thriller", and also noted the influence of [[Michael Moore]] on the film, which he described as "a Moore film with the gags and stunts removed".[13] Duane Byrge of the [[The Hollywood Reporter]] said it deserved a "triple-A rating," writing: "'Inside Job' is no talking-heads drone.
It's a lively, droll and acidic shakedown of the insiders who perpetrated this crisis."[14] Kenneth Turan of the [[Los Angeles Times]] hailed the documentary as a "powerhouse" that presents its complex subject matter with "cinematic verve."[15]
The film was selected for a special screening at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]].
In 2010, economist [[Gene Epstein]], writing for [[Barron's]], criticized the documentary for presenting an incomplete and biased view of the 2008 financial crisis.
While acknowledging elements of truth in the narrative about Wall Street greed, Epstein argued that it failed to adequately explore the proactive role of government policy in the crisis, particularly the influence of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].[17]
[[Shawn Levy (writer)]] of [[The Oregonian]] rated the film B−, writing: "Whether the film's anatomy and analysis of the crash are accurate, they haven't been rendered in a way that's genuinely worth paying contemporary movie ticket prices to learn about it."[18]
