Latin (lingua Latina or Latinum[I]) is a [[Classical language]] belonging to the [[Italic languages]] of the [[Indo-European languages]].
Latin was originally spoken by the [[Latins (Italic tribe)]] in [[Latium]] (now known as [[Lazio]]), the lower [[Tiber]] area around [[Rome]], Italy.[1] Through the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], it became the dominant language in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and subsequently throughout the [[Roman Empire]].
It has greatly influenced many languages, [[Latin influence in English]], having contributed [[List of Latin words with English derivatives]] to the English [[Lexicon]], particularly after the [[Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England]] and the [[Norman Conquest]].
Latin [[Root (linguistics)]] appear frequently in the technical vocabulary used by fields such as [[Theology]], [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]], [[List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes]], and [[List of Latin legal terms]].
By the late [[Roman Republic]], [[Old Latin]] had evolved into standardised [[Classical Latin]].
[[Vulgar Latin]] refers to the less prestigious [[Colloquial register]], attested in inscriptions and some literary works such as those of the comic playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]][2] and the author [[Petronius]].
While often called a "dead language",[3] Latin did not undergo [[Language death]].
Between the 6th and 9th centuries, natural [[Language change]] in the vernacular Latin of different regions evolved into distinct [[Romance languages]].
After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Latin remained the [[Common language]] of [[International communication]], science, scholarship and [[Academia]] in Europe into the early 19th century, by which time modern languages had supplanted it in common academic and political usage.
[[Late Latin]] is the literary form of the language from the 3rd century AD onward.
No longer spoken as a native language, [[Medieval Latin]] was used across Western and Catholic Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] as a working and literary language from the 9th century to the [[Renaissance]], which then developed a classicising form, called [[Renaissance Latin]].
This was the basis for [[Neo-Latin]], which evolved during the [[Early modern period]].
Latin was taught to be written and spoken at least until the late seventeenth century, when spoken skills began to erode; [[Contemporary Latin]] is generally studied to be read rather than spoken.
[[Ecclesiastical Latin]] remains the [[Official language]] of the [[Holy See]] and the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]].
[[Latin grammar]] is highly [[Fusional language]], with classes of inflections for [[Noun case]], [[Grammatical number]], [[Grammatical person]], [[Grammatical gender]], [[Latin tenses]], [[Grammatical mood]], [[Voice (grammar)]], and [[Grammatical aspect]].
The [[Latin alphabet]] is directly derived from the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and [[Greek alphabet]].
In addition to the historical phases, [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] refers to the styles used by the writers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from [[Late Antiquity]] onward, as well as by [[Protestant]] scholars.
The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, also called Archaic or Early Latin, which was spoken from the [[Roman Kingdom]], traditionally founded in 753 BC, through the later part of the [[Roman Republic]], up to 75 BC, i.e. before the age of [[Classical Latin]].[4] It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].
The [[Latin alphabet]] was devised from the [[Etruscan alphabet]].
The writing later changed from what was initially either a [[Right-to-left script]] or a [[Boustrophedon]][5][6] script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.[7]
During the late republic and into the first years of the empire, from about 75 BC to AD 200, a new [[Classical Latin]] arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other [[Literate]] men, who wrote the great works of [[Classical literature]], which were taught in [[Grammar]] and [[Rhetoric]] schools.
Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such [[Roman school]], which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.[8][9]
Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of [[Plautus]], which contain fragments of everyday speech, gives evidence of an informal register of the language, Vulgar Latin (termed sermo vulgi 'the speech of the masses', by [[Cicero]]).
The term 'Vulgar Latin' remains difficult to define, referring both to informal speech at any time within the history of Latin, and the kind of informal Latin that had begun to move away from the written language significantly in the post-Imperial period, that led ultimately to the [[Romance languages]].
During the Classical period, informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors, inscriptions such as [[Curse tablets]] and those found as [[Roman graffiti]].
In the [[Late Latin]] period, language changes reflecting spoken (non-classical) norms tend to be found in greater quantities in texts.[11]
As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically.
On the contrary, Romanised European populations developed their own [[Dialects of Latin]] of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of [[Romance languages]].[12]
After the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in 476 and [[Barbarian kingdoms]] took its place, the [[Germanic people]] adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.[13]
Currently, the five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are [[Spanish language]], [[Portuguese language]], [[French language]], [[Italian language]], and [[Romanian language]].
Despite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy have retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common [[Christians]] (Roman Catholic) culture.
It was not until the [[Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] in 711, cutting off communications between the major Romance regions, that the languages began to diverge seriously.[14] The spoken Latin that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely separated from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire.
For many Italians using Latin, though, there was no complete separation between Italian and Latin, even into the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].
[[Petrarch]] for example saw Latin as a literary version of the spoken language.[17]
Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the post-classical period when no corresponding Latin [[Vernacular]] existed, that is from around 700 to 1500 AD.
It became useful for international communication between the member states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its allies.
Renaissance Latin, in use from around 1300 to 1500, and the classicised Latin that followed through to the present are often grouped together as Neo-Latin, or New Latin, which have in recent decades become a focus of [[Neo-Latin studies]], given their importance for the development of European culture, religion and science.[20][21] The vast majority of written Latin belongs to this period, but its full extent is unknown.[22]
The [[Renaissance]] reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken and written language by the scholarship by the [[Renaissance Humanism]].
[[Petrarch]] and others began to change their usage of Latin as they explored the texts of the Classical Latin world.
Comprehensive versions of authors' works were published by [[Isaac Casaubon]], [[Joseph Scaliger]] and others.[23] Nevertheless, despite the careful work of Petrarch, [[Politian]] and others, first the demand for manuscripts, and then the rush to bring works into print, led to the circulation of inaccurate copies for several centuries following.[24]
Famous and well regarded writers included Petrarch, Erasmus, [[Salutati]], [[Conrad Celtes]], [[George Buchanan]] and [[Thomas More]].[25] Non fiction works were long produced in many subjects, including the sciences, law, philosophy, historiography and theology.
Famous examples include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]].
Latin was also used as a convenient medium for translations of important works first written in a vernacular, such as those of [[Descartes]].
Until the end of the 17th century, the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin.[26] Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French (a [[Romance language]]) and later native or other languages.[27] Education methods gradually shifted towards written Latin, and eventually concentrating solely on reading skills.
The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the [[Catholic Church]].
The Catholic Church required that Mass be carried out in Latin until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–1965, which permitted the use of the [[Vernacular language]].
Latin remains the language of the [[Roman Rite]].
The [[Tridentine Mass]] (also known as the Extraordinary Form or Traditional Latin Mass) is celebrated in Latin.
Although the [[Mass of Paul VI]] (also known as the Ordinary Form or the Novus Ordo) is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings.
It is the official language of the [[Holy See]], the primary language of its [[Public journal]], the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], and the working language of the [[Roman Rota]].
[[Vatican City]] is also home to the world's only [[Automatic teller machine]] that gives instructions in Latin.[28] In the [[Pontifical university]] postgraduate courses of [[Canon law]] are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language.
In the Western world, many organisations, governments and schools use Latin for their mottos due to its association with formality, tradition, and the roots of [[Western culture]].[30]
Canada's motto [[A mari usque ad mare]] ("from sea to sea") and most [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols]] are also in Latin.
The [[Victoria Cross (Canada)]] is modelled after the British [[Victoria Cross]] which has the inscription "For Valour".
Spain's motto [[Plus ultra]] 'even further', or figuratively "Further!", is also Latin in origin.[31] It is taken from the personal motto of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase Non terrae plus ultra ("No land further beyond", "No further!").
According to legend, this phrase was inscribed as a warning on the [[Pillars of Hercules]], the rocks on both sides of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the western end of the known Mediterranean world.
In the United States the unofficial national motto until 1956 was [[E pluribus unum]] meaning "Out of many, one".
The motto continues to be featured on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].
Several states of the United States [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos]], such as:
Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example [[Harvard University]]'s motto is [[Veritas]] ("truth").
Switzerland has adopted the country's Latin short name [[Helvetia]] on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's [[Languages of Switzerland]].
Some film and television in ancient settings, such as [[Sebastiane]], [[The Passion of the Christ]] and [[Barbarians (2020 TV series)]], have been made with dialogue in Latin.
Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/television series as [[The Exorcist (film)]] and [[Lost (TV series)]] ("[[Jughead (Lost)]]").
There are also [[List of songs with Latin lyrics]].
The libretto for the opera-oratorio [[Oedipus rex (opera)]] by [[Igor Stravinsky]] is in Latin.
It is most common in British [[Public school (United Kingdom)]] and grammar schools, the Italian [[Liceo classico]] and [[Liceo scientifico]], the German Humanistisches [[Gymnasium (Germany)]] and the Dutch [[Gymnasium (school)]].
Notable examples include [[Radio Bremen]] in Germany, [[YLE]] radio in Finland (the [[Nuntii Latini]] broadcast from 1989 until it was shut down in June 2019),[32] and Vatican Radio & Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.[33][34][35]
The [[Latin Wikipedia]] has more than 140,000 articles.
[[Italian language]], [[French language]], [[Portuguese language]], [[Spanish language]], [[Romanian language]], [[Catalan language]], [[Romansh language]], [[Sardinian language]] and other [[Romance languages]] are direct descendants of Latin.
There are also many Latin [[Loanword]] in English and [[Albanian language]],[39] as well as a few in [[German language]], [[Dutch language]], [[Norwegian language]], [[Danish language]] and [[Swedish language]].[40] Latin is still spoken in Vatican City, a city-state situated in Rome that is the seat of the [[Catholic Church]].
The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analysed in [[Philology]].
They are in part the subject matter of the field of [[Classics]].
Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the [[Loeb Classical Library]], published by [[Harvard University Press]], or the [[Oxford Classical Texts]], published by [[Oxford University Press]].[citation needed]
[[Latin translations of modern literature]] such as: [[The Hobbit]], [[Treasure Island]], [[Robinson Crusoe]], [[Paddington Bear]], [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[The Adventures of Tintin]], [[Asterix]], [[Harry Potter]], [[The Little Prince]], [[Max and Moritz]], [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]], [[The Cat in the Hat]], and a book of fairy tales, fabulae mirabiles, are intended to garner popular interest in the language.
Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as [[Meissner's Latin Phrasebook]].
Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] (CIL).
Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the [[Provenance]] and relevant information.
The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of [[Epigraphy]].
The [[Latin influence in English]] has been significant at all stages of its insular development.
In the [[Middle Ages]], borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in the 6th century or indirectly after the [[Norman Conquest]], through the [[Anglo-Norman language]].[citation needed] From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed "[[Inkhorn term]]", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink.
Many of the most common [[Polysyllabic]] English words are of Latin origin through the medium of [[Old French]].
The influence of Roman governance and [[Roman technology]] on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialised areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law.
For example, [[Linnaean taxonomy]] of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by [[Natural History (Pliny)]], an encyclopaedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by [[Pliny the Elder]].
Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as [[Galen]], established that today's [[Medical terminology]] would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin.
Roman engineering had the same effect on [[Scientific terminology]] as a whole.
Latin law principles have survived partly in a long [[List of Latin legal terms]].
The [[Logudorese]] dialect of the [[Sardinian language]] and [[Italian language]] are the two closest contemporary languages to Latin.[45]
The prominence of Latin in classical education rested not only on tradition but also on its reputation for clarity, logical structure, and intellectual rigor, a view expressed by the mathematics educator [[Theodor Haagaas]], who remarked that "Latin, it is mathematics, language mathematics."[46]
[[Instruction in Latin]] is an essential aspect.
The [[Living Latin]] movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication.
It is available in Vatican City and at some institutions in the US, such as the [[University of Kentucky]] and [[Iowa State University]].
The British [[Cambridge University Press]] is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the [[Cambridge Latin Course]] series.
It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called [[Minimus]].
In the United Kingdom, the [[Classical Association]] encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants.
The [[University of Cambridge]],[53] the [[Open University]],[54] a number of independent schools, for example [[Eton College]], [[Harrow School]], [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]], and [[Rugby School]], and The Latin Programme/Via Facilis,[55] a London-based charity, run Latin courses.
In the United States and in Canada, the [[American Classical League]] supports every effort to further the study of classics.
Its subsidiaries include the [[National Junior Classical League]] (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the [[National Senior Classical League]], which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college.
The league also sponsors the [[National Latin Exam]].
Classicist [[Mary Beard (classicist)]] wrote in [[The Times Literary Supplement]] in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.[56]
It had official status in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the 11th to mid-19th centuries, when [[Hungarian language]] became the exclusive official language in 1844.[57] The best known Latin language poet of Hungarian origin was [[Janus Pannonius]].
Similarly, in the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Latin was officially recognised and widely used[58][59][60][61] between the 10th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the [[Szlachta]].[61] Latin was also the official language of the [[Croatian Parliament]] from the 13th to the 19th century (1847).[62] The oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions (Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis)—held in Zagreb (Zagabria), Croatia—date from 19 April 1273.
An extensive [[Croatian Latin literature]] exists.
The consonant [[Phoneme]] of Classical Latin are as follows:[65]
the 1st century BC, when it was probably pronounced (at least by educated speakers) [z] initially and [[Gemination]] [zz] between vowels, in accordance with its pronunciation in [[Koine Greek]].
In Latin, ⟨q⟩ is always followed by the [[Vowel]] ⟨u⟩.
In Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between [[Letter case]], and the letters ⟨J U W⟩ did not exist.
In Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as [[Gemination]] consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants.
(In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or [[Morpheme]], as in that example.)
⟨Y⟩ was adopted to represent [[Upsilon]] in loanwords from [[Greek language]], but it was pronounced like ⟨u⟩ and ⟨i⟩ by some speakers.
Classical Latin distinguished between [[Vowel length]].
Then, long vowels, except for ⟨i⟩, were frequently marked using the [[Apex (diacritic)]], which was sometimes similar to an [[Acute accent]] ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩.
Long /iː/ was written using a taller version of ⟨I⟩, called i longa '[[Long I]]': ⟨ꟾ⟩.
In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a [[Macron (diacritic)]] ⟨ā ē ī ō ū⟩, and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a [[Breve]] ⟨ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ⟩.
A vowel letter followed by ⟨m⟩ at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by ⟨n⟩ before ⟨s⟩ or ⟨f⟩, represented a short [[Nasal vowel]], as in monstrum [mõːstrũ].
Classical Latin had several [[Diphthong]].
[[Syllable]] in Latin are signified by the presence of diphthongs and [[Vowel]].
An exception occurs when a [[Phonetic transcription]] stop and liquid come together.
Syllables in Latin are considered either [[Syllable weight#Basic definitions]] (less often called "heavy" and "light" respectively).
There are two rules that define which syllable is [[Stress (linguistics)]] in Classical Latin.[68]
Latin was written in the Latin alphabet ([[A]], [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[E]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[I]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[O]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[X]]), derived from the [[Etruscan alphabet]], which was in turn drawn from the [[Greek alphabet]] and ultimately the [[Phoenician alphabet]].[77] This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic and many Slavic languages ([[Polish language]], [[Slovak language]], [[Slovene language]], [[Croatian language]], [[Bosnian language]], [[Serbian language]] and [[Czech language]]); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including [[Vietnamese language]], the [[Austronesian languages]], many [[Turkic languages]], and most languages in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas and Oceania, making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system.
When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.[78] Later, G was added to represent /ɡ/, which had previously been spelled C, and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no [[Voiced alveolar fricative]].[79] The letters K, Y, and Z were later added to represent Greek letters [[Kappa]], [[Upsilon]], and [[Zeta]] respectively, in Greek loanwords.[79]
Classical Latin did not contain sentence [[Punctuation]], letter case,[80] or [[Interword spacing]], but [[Apex (diacritic)]] were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the [[Interpunct]] was used at times to separate words.
The first line of [[Catullus 3]] ("Mourn, O [[Venus (mythology)]] and [[Cupid]]") was originally written as:
The [[Roman cursive]] script is commonly found on the many [[Wax tablet]] excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on [[Hadrian's Wall]] in Britain.
Most notable is the fact that while most of the [[Vindolanda tablets]] show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era.
Latin is a [[Synthetic language]], [[Fusional language]] in the terminology of linguistic typology.
Words involve an objective semantic element and markers (usually suffixes) specifying the grammatical use of the word, expressing [[Grammatical gender]], [[Grammatical number]], and [[Grammatical case]] in [[Adjective]], [[Noun]], and [[Pronoun]] ([[Declension]]) and verbs to denote [[Grammatical person]], [[Grammatical number]], [[Grammatical tense]], [[Grammatical voice]], [[Grammatical mood]], and [[Grammatical aspect]] ([[Grammatical conjugation]]).
Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and [[Latin interjections]].
[[Latin word order]] is relatively free because inflections disambiguate semantic connections, but different word orders can indicate different nuances of meaning.
Thus, [[Latin word order]] is not as important as it is in English, which is less inflected.
Latin lacks both definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)]] so puer currit can mean either 'the boy is running' or 'a boy is running'.
Latin adjectives also have [[Comparative and superlative]] forms.
There are also a number of Latin [[Participles]].
A few [[Adposition]], however, govern a noun in the genitive, such as gratia and tenus.
A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main [[Latin conjugation]].
The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in -ā-re or -ā-ri (active and passive respectively): amāre 'to love', hortārī 'to exhort'; of the second conjugation by -ē-re or -ē-rī: monēre 'to warn', verērī 'to fear', of the third conjugation by -ere, -ī: dūcere 'to lead', ūtī 'to use'; of the fourth by -ī-re, -ī-rī: audīre 'to hear', experīrī 'to attempt'.[82] The stem categories descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages.
[[Regular and irregular verbs]] are verbs that do not follow the regular conjugations in the formation of the inflected form.
There are six simple [[Grammatical tense]] in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three [[Grammatical mood]] (indicative, imperative and [[Subjunctive mood in Latin]], in addition to the [[Infinitive]], [[Participle]], [[Gerund]], [[Gerundive]] and [[Supine]]), three [[Grammatical person]] (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two [[Grammatical voice]] (active and passive) and two [[Grammatical aspect]] ([[Perfective and imperfective]]).
The six simple [[Latin tenses (semantics)]] are divided into two systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future forms, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect forms.
Some Latin verbs are [[Deponent verb]], causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum 'to urge'.
As Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral [[Proto-Indo-European language]].
However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some [[Etruscan language]] words into their language, including persona 'mask' and histrio 'actor'.[83] Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from [[Oscan language]], another Italic language.
After the [[History of Taranto]] in 272 BC, the Romans began Hellenising, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as camera 'vaulted roof', sumbolum 'symbol', and balineum 'bath'.[83] This Hellenisation led to the addition of Y and Z to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds.[84] Subsequently, the Romans transplanted [[Greek art]], medicine, science and philosophy to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece.
During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms.[86] Into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including [[Old English]] and other [[Germanic languages]].
Over the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by [[Affix]] or [[Compound (linguistics)]] meaningful [[Segment (linguistics)]].[87] For example, the compound adjective, omnipotens 'all-powerful', was produced from the adjectives omnis 'all', and potens 'powerful', by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating.
Today, the numbers can be written with the [[Arabic numerals]] as well as with [[Roman numerals]].
[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]], also called De Bello Gallico (The Gallic War), written by [[Julius Caesar]], begins with the following passage:
The same text may be marked for all long vowels (before any possible elisions at word boundary) with [[Apex (diacritic)]] over vowel letters, including customarily before nf and ns where a long vowel is automatically produced:
until 75 BC[[Old Latin]]
