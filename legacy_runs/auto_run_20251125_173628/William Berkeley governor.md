Sir William Berkeley (/ˈbɑːrkliː/; 1605 – 9 July 1677) was an English colonial administrator  who served as the [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]] from 1660 to 1677.
One of the [[Proprietary colony]] of the [[Province of Carolina]], as governor of Virginia he implemented policies that bred dissent among the colonists and sparked [[Bacon's Rebellion]].
A [[Favourite]] of [[Charles I of England]], the king first granted him the governorship in 1642.
Berkeley was unseated following the execution of Charles I, but his governorship was restored by [[Charles II of England]] in 1660.
Charles II also named Berkeley one of the eight Lords Proprietors of Carolina, in recognition of his loyalty to the [[House of Stuart]] during the [[English Civil War]].
As governor, Berkeley oversaw the implementation of a policy known as [[Partus sequitur ventrem]], which mandated that all babies born to enslaved parents take the legal status of their mother.
As proprietor of [[Green Spring Plantation]] in [[James City County, Virginia]], he experimented with activities such as growing [[Silkworm]] as part of his efforts to expand the tobacco-based economy.
Berkeley was born in 1605 in [[Bruton]], Somersetshire to [[Maurice Berkeley (died 1617)]] and Elizabeth Killigrew, of the [[Bruton branch of the Berkeley family]], both of whom held stock in the [[Virginia Company of London]].[1] Referred to as "Will" by his family and friends,[2]: p5  he was born in the winter of 1605 into landed gentry.[2]: p2  His father died when he was twelve and, though indebted, left Berkeley land in Somerset.[2]: p5  His elder brother was [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]].
He entered grammar school at about six or seven years old where he became literate in [[Latin]] and English.[2]: p6  At eighteen, like the other Berkeley men, he entered Oxford.
He began his studies at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] in the footsteps of his forebears, but quickly transferred to [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], a "throwback to medieval times".[2]: p7  He received, though not necessarily completed, a B.A. in fifteen months of his arrival at the Hall.[2]: p8
Berkeley wrote several plays, one of which — The Lost Lady: A Tragy Comedy — was performed for Charles I and [[Henrietta Maria]] and was published in 1638.
Soldiering in the First and Second [[Bishops' Wars]] (1639–1640) gained Berkeley a [[Knight Bachelor]].[1]
Berkeley replaced [[Francis Wyatt]] as [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]] in 1641.[1] He was governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]] from 1641 to 1652 and from 1660 to 1677.
Arriving at Jamestown in 1642, Berkeley erected [[Green Spring Plantation]] on a tract of land west of the capital, where he experimented with alternatives to tobacco.[1] It was at Green Spring that he planted such diverse crops as corn, wheat, barley, rye, [[Rapeseed]], tobacco,[4] oranges, lemons, grapes,[4]: 66  sugar and silk.[4]: 70  Berkeley devoted much of his time as a planter to experimenting with alternatives to tobacco; although he always produced the crop, he "despised" it.[4]: 67  As a planter, with Virginia in mind, Berkeley constantly attempted to determine the best crops for the state through trial and error.[4]: 68  Berkeley produced flax, fruits, potash, silk, and spirits which he exported through a commercial network that joined Green Spring to markets in North America, the West Indies, Great Britain, and Holland.[1] Upon the recommendation of several of his slaves, Berkeley became a successful rice farmer.[5][6] They were familiar with its cultivation from their native West Africa.[7] He owned [[Boldrup Plantation]].[8]
After the king was executed following trial in 1649, Berkeley dispatched his secretary of state [[Richard Lee I]] to the Dutch Republic to secure an extension of his office from the [[Stadholder]].
Berkeley was "bitterly hostile" to Virginia's [[Puritans]] and [[Quakers]].
He returned from retirement in 1660 due to the early death of Governor [[Samuel Mathews (Colonial Virginia governor)]].[1] At his return, Berkeley appealed to England for financial support of Virginia's economy.
In 1675, Berkeley appointed [[Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia colonist and rebel)]], [[Frances Culpeper Berkeley]]'s nephew, to Virginian high office.[4]: 234
The [[Treaty of 1677]], the formal peace treaty between the Indians and the colonists, was signed on 29 May 1677, after Berkeley returned to England."[1]
Berkeley died in Berkeley House, [[Mayfair]], England, on 9 July 1677, and he was "buried half a world away from the place that had become his home"[1] in the crypt of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]],[12] where there is a memorial window to him and his brother, Lord Berkeley.[13]
