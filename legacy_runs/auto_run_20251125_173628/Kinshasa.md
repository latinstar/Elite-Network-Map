Kinshasa (/kɪnˈʃɑːsə/; French: [kinʃasa]; [[Lingala language]]: Kinsásá), formerly named Léopoldville from 1881–1966 ([[Dutch language]]: Leopoldstad), is the [[Capital city]] and [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
Kinshasa is one of the world's fastest-growing [[Megacity]], with an estimated population of 17.8 million in 2024.[6] It is the [[List of cities and towns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[List of cities in Africa by population]] and [[List of urban areas in Africa by population]] in Africa, and the world's [[List of largest cities]] and [[List of national capitals by population]].
It is the leading [[Economy]], [[Politics]], and [[Cultural center]] of the DRC,[7][8][9][10] housing several industries including [[Manufacturing]],[11] [[Telecommunications]],[12][13] [[List of banks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Entertainment]].[14][15] The city also hosts some of the DRC's significant institutional buildings, such as the [[People's Palace (Kinshasa)]], [[Palace of the Nation (Kinshasa)]], [[Court of Cassation (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]], [[Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[African Union City]], [[Marble Palace, Kinshasa]], [[Martyrs Stadium, Kinshasa]], [[Government House, Kinshasa]], [[Kinshasa Financial Center]], and other national departments and agencies.[16][17][18][19]
The Kinshasa site has been inhabited by [[Teke people]] and Humbu people for centuries and was known as Nshasa before transforming into a [[Commercial area]] during the 19th and 20th centuries.[20][21] The city was named Léopoldville by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in honor of [[Leopold II of Belgium]].[20][22][23] The name was changed to Kinshasa in 1966 during [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s [[Authenticité (Zaire)]] campaign as a tribute to Nshasa village.[20] Covering 9,965 square kilometers, Kinshasa stretches along the southern shores of the [[Pool Malebo]] on the [[Congo River]].
It forms an expansive crescent across flat, low-lying terrain at an average altitude of about 300 meters.[20] Kinshasa borders the [[Mai-Ndombe Province]], [[Kwilu Province]], and [[Kwango]] to the east; the [[Congo River]] delineates its western and northern perimeters, constituting a [[Natural border]] with the [[Republic of the Congo]]; to the south lies the [[Kongo Central]].
Across the river sits [[Brazzaville]], the smaller capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo, forming the world's closest pair of capital cities despite being separated by a four-kilometer-wide unbridged span of the Congo River.[24][25][20][26]
Kinshasa also functions as one of the [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]; it is administratively divided into [[Communes of Kinshasa]], which are further subdivided into 365 neighborhoods.[27] With an expansive administrative region, over 90 percent of the province's land remains rural, while urban growth predominantly occurs on its western side.[28] Kinshasa is the largest nominally [[Geographical distribution of French speakers]] urban area globally, with [[French language]] being the language of government, education, media, public services and high-end commerce, while [[Lingala]] is used as a [[Lingua franca]] in the street.
The [[National Museum of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is DRC's most prominent and central museum.
The [[Collège des Hautes Études de Stratégie et de Défense]] is the highest military institution in DRC and Central Africa.
The [[Université Pédagogique Nationale]] is DRC's first pedagogical university and one of Africa's top pedagogical universities.
[[N'djili Airport]] is the largest airport in the nation.[32] In 2015, Kinshasa was designated as a [[City of Music (UNESCO)]] by [[UNESCO]] and has been a member of the [[Creative Cities Network]] since then.[33][34] [[Nsele Valley Park]] is the largest [[Urban park]] in Kinshasa, housing a range of [[Fauna]] and [[Flora]].
According to the [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees]], Kinshasa is Africa's most expensive city for [[Expatriate]] employees, ahead of close to 200 global locations.[35][36][37]
Paul Raymaekers, an [[Anthropologist]] and [[Ethnology]], suggests that the name derives from the combination of the [[Kongo language]] and Kihumbu languages.[20] The prefix "Ki(n)" signifies a hill or inhabited area and "Nsasa" or "Nshasa" refers to a bag of salt.
According to Raymackers, Kinshasa was a significant trading site where people from the Lower Congo (now [[Kongo Central]]) and [[Atlantic Ocean]] exchanged salt for goods such as [[Iron]], [[Slavery]] and [[Ivory]] brought by those from the Upper Congo (now [[Tshopo Province]]).[20] However Hendrik van Moorsel, an anthropologist, historian and researcher, proposes that [[Teke people]] [[Fisherman]] traded fish for cassava with locals along the riverbank, and the place of this exchange was called "Ulio".[20][21] In [[Teke languages]], "exchange" is "Utsaya", and "place of exchange" is "Intsaya".
Thus, the name evolved from Ulio to Intsaya, and later, under the influence of Kikongo, transformed into Kintsaya, eventually becoming Kinshasa.[20] Kinshasa, also known as N'shasa, is regarded as the primary "place of exchange" on the southern bank of the [[Pool Malebo]], where [[Barter]] occurred even before the commercial boom of [[Kintambo]].[20]
It was at this location that Teke [[Broker]] traded ivory and slaves from the Banunu slave traders, often mistaken for the [[Yanzi people]], for European trade items brought by the Zombo and [[Kongo people]] people.[20] Despite the various theories, the historical name of Kinshasa is known to have been Nshasa, as documented by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] during his crossing of [[Africa]] from [[Zanzibar]] to [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1874–1877 when he mentioned visiting "the king of Nshasa" on 14 March 1877.[20][23][22]
In pre-colonial times, the area was inhabited by two trading centres, [[Ntamo]] and Ntsaasa, which were part of the [[Tio Kingdom]].[38]: 247–55
The city was established as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1881.[39] It was named Léopoldville in honor of Stanley's employer [[Leopold II of the Belgians]].
He would then proceed to take control of most of the [[Congo Basin]] as the [[Congo Free State]], not as a colony but as his private property.
The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above [[Livingstone Falls]], a series of rapids over 300 kilometres (190 miles) below Leopoldville.
At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between Léopoldville and [[Matadi]], the port below the rapids and 150 km (93 mi) from the coast.
The completion of the [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway]] [[Portage railway]], in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of Léopoldville.
In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville.[40] By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the [[Belgian Congo]], replacing the town of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the Congo estuary, pursuant to the Royal Decree of 1 July 1923, countersigned by the [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)]], Louis Franc.[20][40] This transition, finalized in 1929, led to the development of a new administrative [[Quarter (urban subdivision)]] located between [[Kinshasa (commune)]], then emerging as a major commercial center, and Léopoldville-West, a preexisting settlement.
The selected site was named [[Gombe, Kinshasa]] (now [[Gombe, Kinshasa]]) and developed as the colonial administrative center.[41] Before this, Léopoldville was designated an "urban district", encompassing exclusively the [[Communes of Kinshasa]] of [[Kintambo]] and the current Gombe, which burgeoned around [[Ngaliema Bay]].[20][42][43] Then the communes of [[Kinshasa (commune)]], [[Barumbu]], and [[Lingwala]] emerged.
In the 1930s, these communes predominantly housed employees of Chanic, Filtisaf, and [[TEXAF]].[43]
In 1941, legislative ordinance n°293/AIMO of 25 June 1941, conferred Kinshasa the status of a city and established an Urban Committee (Comité Urbain), with an allocated area of 5,000 hectares and a population of 53,000.[44][43] Concurrently, it became the colony's capital, the [[Congo-Kasaï]]'s capital, and the [[Mongala]] district.
The urban populace swelled in 1945 with the cessation of [[Forced labour]], facilitating the influx of native Africans from rural regions.
Léopoldville then became predominantly inhabited by the [[Kongo people]] ethnic group.[43]
In the 1950s, [[Planned community]] such as [[Lemba, Kinshasa]], [[Matete]], and a segment of Ndjili were established to accommodate workers from the [[Limete]] industrial zone.[43] [[Lovanium University]], the colony's inaugural university, was founded in 1954.[43] By 1957, Léopoldville comprised eleven communes and six adjunct regions: [[Kalamu]], [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa]] (present-day [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa]]), [[Lingwala]] (now [[Lingwala]]), [[Ngiri-Ngiri]], [[Kintambo]], [[Limete]], [[Bandalungwa]], [[Gombe, Kinshasa]] (current [[Gombe, Kinshasa]]), [[Barumbu]], [[Kinshasa (commune)]], and [[Ngaliema]]; along with the adjunct regions of Lemba, [[Binza group]], [[Makala]], [[Kimwenza]], [[Kimbanseke]], and Kingasani.
After gaining its independence on 30 June 1960, following [[Léopoldville riots]], the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)]] [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960]] its first prime minister, [[Patrice Lumumba]] whose perceived pro-Soviet leanings were viewed as a threat by Western interests.
Less than a year after Lumumba's election, the Belgians and the U.S. bought the support of his Congolese rivals and set in motion the events that culminated in Lumumba's assassination.[45] In 1964, [[Moïse Tshombe]] decreed the expulsion of all nationals of [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Burundi]] and [[Mali]], as well as all political refugees from [[Rwanda]].[46][47][48][49] In 1965, with the help of the U.S. and Belgium, [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] seized power in the Congo.
He initiated a policy of "[[Authenticité (Zaire)]]", attempting to renativize the names of people and places in the country.
On 2 May 1966, the government announced that the nation's major cities would be restored to their pre-colonial names, effective on 30 June, the sixth anniversary of independence.[50] Léopoldville was renamed Kinshasa, for [[Kinshasa (commune)]] that once stood near the site.
European [[Urban planning]] began in 1881 and was guided by [[Grid plan]] principles aimed at preserving an orderly and aesthetically pleasing environment, emphasizing open space and vegetation.[51] A major catalyst for urban expansion was the construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]], initiated in 1890 and completed in 1911.
This infrastructure project was emblematic of colonial progress and served as a critical link between the port of Léopoldville and the coastal city of [[Matadi]].[52] Upon its completion, the station area began to transform, with the erection of [[Prefabricated home]] known as "[[Architecture of Denmark]]", imported from Belgium.
By 1902, the [[Kintambo]] (now [[Kintambo]]) area was entirely occupied by European constructions.[52] The urban center expanded as surrounding villages grew, drawn by the prospects of employment and commerce.
At this early stage, the connection between Léopoldville (commonly referred to as "Léo") and [[Kinshasa (commune)]] consisted of an eight-kilometer track that was often impassable during the rainy season.
This plan would guide spatial development for the coming decades.[55][52] Ironically, [[World War I]] accelerated local economic activity.
While major firms such as [[Huileries du Congo Belge]] (HCB) complied by building workers' camps, smaller enterprises often failed to meet these requirements.[56] The existing framework, governed by the decree on "the labor contract between natives and civilized masters", proved insufficient to meet growing housing demands.[56] In response, [[Missionary]] extended loans to African residents for [[Self-build]], though they were quickly overwhelmed by demand.
A special fund was subsequently established to provide [[Interest-free economy]] loans for the construction of houses using locally available materials.[56]
Lacking modern infrastructure like sewers, these neighborhoods only had basic sanitation facilities, typically simple [[Pit latrine]] made from a hole dug or drilled into the ground.[51] During the 1920s, the urban growth brought the indigenous [[Quarter (urban subdivision)]] into proximity with European residential areas, particularly near the Matadi–Kinshasa Railway and the [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] (now [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]]).[51] This spatial convergence led to heightened concerns among European settlers regarding public health and urban hygiene, leading the Léopoldville Urban Committee in 1933 to implement a buffer known as the "neutral zone".[57][51] Although an 800-meter-wide zone was recommended, the implemented buffer measured only 250 to 300 meters due to logistical constraints and exemptions granted to some Europeans residing in the area.[57][51] This zone, referred to as [[Kinshasa Botanical Garden]], now the [[Kinshasa Botanical Garden]], was created by District Commissioner Fernand De Bock and agronomist Roeck.[51] The zone also housed the [[Kinshasa Zoological Garden]] and served both as a [[Recreation area]] for European residents and as a sanitary barrier between the European and indigenous quarters.
[[Kitchen garden]], maintained by unemployed volunteers, were cultivated within the park.[51] Located immediately south of the neutral zone, the indigenous area included notable facilities such as [[N'Dolo Airport]], a [[Kinshasa Central Market]], the botanical and zoological gardens, [[Kinshasa General Hospital]], a wireless telegraph station (TSF), a [[Golf course]], a cemetery, and Camp Léopold II (now Camp [[Justin Kokolo]]).[57][58][59]
Belgian colonial authorities, motivated by a [[Paternalism]] ideology associated with the so-called "[[Civilizing mission]]", initiated efforts to provide formal housing for the African population, particularly for those employed in urban areas.
In the aftermath of the [[World War II]], a large-scale residential project was launched in [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa]], present-day [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa]] commune, on 407 hectares of land.[57] The development was overseen by the Service de la Population Noire under the direction of Dendale, from whom the area took its name.
This "Nouvelle Cité" was among the first [[Planned community]] zones for Congolese workers.
By 1947, just two years after its inception, the area housed over 8,000 residents, including future President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]].
Beginning in 1949, under a ten-year plan, OCA spearheaded projects involving [[Urban design]], infrastructure, community facilities, and housing construction.[51] Over 40,000 homes were built by 1959, following a controlled, segregationist approach.
Planning responsibilities were initially led by urban planner Georges Ricquier and later taken over by Maurice Heymans in 1953.[51] The new city plan preserved European dominance over the historical center ([[Gombe, Kinshasa]]), limiting expansion to adjacent zones and promoting industrial development in [[Limete]].[51]
Post-1950s [[Urban sprawl]] arose due to the "sprawl of quartiers, the high demand for housing among the population, and the increasing distance between riverside employment zones and cités indigènes".
Communes like Kasa-Vubu and [[Ngiri-Ngiri]] featured structured housing with proper streets, sanitation systems, [[Twin Houses]], and [[Terraced house]].
Some housing areas were self-built but still regulated, with residents adhering to official layouts and construction guidelines based on their resources.[51] Between 1954 and 1960, OCA developed [[Matete]], [[Bandalungwa]], and [[Lemba, Kinshasa]], alongside the [[Satellite city]] of [[Ndjili, Kinshasa]].
These included prearranged roads, [[Drainage system (agriculture)]], sewer networks, and paved primary access routes.[51]
For the first time, two-[[Storey]] houses and collective apartment buildings appeared, particularly in Bandalungwa, Matete, and Lemba.
[[Kalamu]] followed with the expansion of Camp Kaouka and the 20 May neighborhood beyond the Funa River.[51] Further east, across the Yolo River, residential development continued in Limete and its accompanying industrial zone.[51]
In 1991 the city had to [[1991 Zaire unrest]], who were protesting the government's failure to pay them.
The eruption of the [[First Congo War]] (1996–1997), closely tied to the aftermath of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]], significantly intensified instability in Kinshasa and across the broader region.
Following the genocide, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), under [[Paul Kagame]], launched military operations into eastern Zaire, not only targeting [[Hutu]] insurgents but also committing large-scale violence against Hutu civilians.[60][61][62] [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] consultant [[Robert Gersony]] estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 people were killed monthly in mid-1994 alone.
The influx of over two million Rwandan Hutu refugees into eastern Zaire further exacerbated security and humanitarian tensions, particularly in provinces such as [[South Kivu]].[60][63][64] President Mobutu's regime proved incapable of managing the crisis, thus facilitating the conditions for war.[65] By 1996, foreign-backed militias, including the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] (RPA), the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]] (UPDF), and Burundi's [[Forces Armées Burundaises]] (FAB), began supporting Congolese [[Tutsi]] groups such as the [[Banyamulenge]].[65] Belgian legal and political scholar [[Filip Reyntjens]] describes the First Congo War as the convergence of two overlapping goals: the genuine resistance of Congolese Tutsi, who feared retaliation, and the strategic use of this resistance by the Rwandan government to justify the RPA's military involvement in Zaire.[66]
The fall of Kinshasa in May 1997 to the Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed [[AFDL]] (AFDL), led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], marked the beginning of serious human rights abuses in the capital.[67] In the days following the city's capture, AFDL and RPA forces carried out [[Extrajudicial killing]], acts of [[Torture]], [[Rape]], and targeted former regime officials as well as members of the elite [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP).[67] On 17 May, Mobutu was overthrown in an AFDL-led coup.[68] Between 18 and 22 May 1997, volunteer teams from the [[Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] collected between 228 and 318 bodies in Kinshasa and its outskirts and evacuated wounded civilians to local medical facilities.
Reports from the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] and the [[DRC Mapping Exercise Report]] indicate that the security situation deteriorated further between May and June 1997.[67] During this period, AFDL and RPA units, often with the participation of civilians, carried out [[Public execution]], frequently incinerating the bodies in neighborhoods such as [[Masina, Kinshasa]], [[Matete]], and Kingabwa ([[Limete]] commune).
At the GLM (Groupe Litho Moboti) building, detainees, many of them former members of the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Zaire (1971–1997)]] (Forces Armées Zaïroises; FAZ) or political opponents, were routinely executed and their bodies discarded in the [[Congo River]], a practice halted only after intervention by human rights advocates alerted by local fishermen.[67] In September 1997, the security crisis in Kinshasa was compounded by cross-border shelling from [[Brazzaville]].
In June and July 1997, detainees in [[Military prison]] at Kokolo and [[Colonel Tshatshi Military Camp]] suffered ill-treatment that led to numerous deaths from torture, disease, and medical neglect.[67] Reports from late 1997 indicate that at least 24 wounded former members of the [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] (Forces Armées Rwandaises, ex-FAR) soldiers disappeared after being transferred from hospitals to military camps, where they were subjected to threats and degrading treatment.[67] The militarization of Kinshasa's public life continued under the new regime.
Units of the [[Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Force Aérienne Congolaise, FAC) and the RPA, particularly the young [[Child soldiers in Africa]] known as Kadogo, imposed harsh disciplinary measures on civilians, including public floggings and whippings with the chicotte, a "leather-thonged whipping device".
Beginning in June 1997, the new authorities ordered ex-FAZ to undergo political re-education at [[Kitona]] military base in [[Kongo Central]] (now [[Kongo Central]]).
Victims were often subjected to sexual slavery and forced domestic labor.[67] At Kokolo military camp, similar atrocities occurred, including [[Gang rape]] and the random abduction and assault of women in nearby neighborhoods.
Opposition activists and their families were frequently subjected to harassment, [[Arbitrary arrest and detention]], and torture.
Women related to political figures were especially vulnerable to sexual violence during state crackdowns.[67] Activists from major opposition parties such as the [[Unified Lumumbist Party]] (PALU), [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress]] (UDPS), and the Front pour la Survie de la Démocratie au Congo (FSDC) were frequent targets.
In July 1997, FAC and RPA soldiers killed between one and four PALU members during a protest crackdown and injured several others.[67] The residence of PALU leader [[Antoine Gizenga]] was ransacked, resulting in the death of an activist and the severe beating of six more.
The eruption of the [[Second Congo War]] in August 1998 plunged Kinshasa into a period of acute insecurity and military confrontation.
Kabila accused these states of undermining Congolese sovereignty and harboring ambitions to orchestrate a [[Coup d'état]].[69][70] Allegations also surfaced that the [[United States]] had provided indirect support to Rwanda during this period, including claims of [[Military education and training]] by the Rwanda Interagency Assessment Team (RIAT), ostensibly to secure access to the DRC's vast mineral wealth.[71][72] American individuals and institutions, such as Roger Winter of the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], were further implicated in allegedly abetting insurgent activities.[71] In response to these tensions, President Kabila dismissed Rwandan General [[James Kabarebe]] from his position as [[Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and demanded the withdrawal of all Rwandan military personnel from Congolese territory.[69][70] This move provoked a swift counteroffensive, as Rwanda and Uganda backed the formation of a new rebel group, the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), which launched its rebellion from the city of Goma on 2 August 1998.[73] The insurrection was spearheaded by mutinous units within the Congolese armed forces in coordination with Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian troops.
Within weeks, RCD forces had captured large swathes of territory in the eastern and northern parts of the country, including regions of [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]], [[Orientale Province]], North [[Katanga Province]], and [[Équateur (former province)]].[73] Their advance toward Kinshasa and the western province of Bas-Congo was halted by military intervention from [[Angola]] and [[Zimbabwe]], both of which deployed troops in support of Kabila's government.[73]
Kabila's administration, reinforced by military contingents from Angola, Zimbabwe, [[Namibia]], [[Chad]], and [[Sudan]], retained authority over the western and central regions.
Conversely, the eastern part of the country fell under the control of the RCD's military wing, the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC), which was supported by Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian forces.[73] In response, Kabila aligned with a range of non-state actors and militias, notably the [[Mai-Mai]] as well as Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebel groups including the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (FDD) and the [[Army for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (ALiR), the latter composed in part of former members of the Rwandan Armed Forces and the [[Interahamwe]] militia.
Uganda, while occupying substantial portions of Orientale Province, simultaneously sponsored the establishment of the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo]] (MLC), under the leadership of [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]], to administer the Ugandan-controlled regions of Équateur.[73] Diverging strategic interests between Uganda and Rwanda eventually led to a split within the RCD itself, giving rise to two rival factions: the Rwanda-aligned RCD–Goma and the Uganda-supported RCD–ML.[73] Despite their military superiority, these rebel coalitions faced persistent challenges in exerting full administrative and security control over rural areas, where they were met with sustained resistance from local militias, interethnic hostility, and community mistrust.[74]
Forces of the ANC, RPA, and UPDF clashed with troops from FAC and the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] (ZDF) for control of the capital.
The ZDF employed heavy artillery to bombard densely populated neighborhoods, including [[Kimbanseke]], [[Masina, Kinshasa]], [[Ndjili, Kinshasa]], and the village of Kingatoko, located near the border of Bas-Congo Province.[75] These attacks resulted in the deaths of approximately 50 civilians and left 282 wounded, who were admitted to medical facilities across the capital during the night of 27 to 28 August.
On 28 August 1998, in [[Mont Ngafula]], FAC soldiers brutally killed two Red Cross volunteers, one by crushing his skull, as they attempted to rescue victims in the Mitendi and Mbenseke areas.[75] The incident left several others severely wounded.
On 13 August 1998, troops from the ANC, RPA, and UPDF seized the [[Inga dams]] [[Hydroelectricity]] station in Bas-Congo Province, halting its [[Turbine]] for three weeks.[75] This act deprived Kinshasa and parts of Bas-Congo of electricity and water, critically affecting essential services such as hospitals.
From the onset of the conflict, Congolese security forces were implicated in widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, and [[Arbitrary arrest and detention]].
Political opponents and ordinary civilians alike were subject to these violations with near-total impunity.[75] Between August 1998 and January 2001, approximately 50 incident reports were submitted to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and its mechanisms, including the [[Working group]] on arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances, and the Special Rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial killings.[75]
These sites became centers for torture, sexual violence, and in some cases, extrajudicial execution.[75] A significant crackdown occurred on 28 October 2000, when President Kabila's security services arrested at least 93 individuals, including 60 soldiers and 33 civilians from North Kivu, South Kivu, and [[Maniema]], on accusations of plotting a coup d'état involving Anselme Masasu Nindaga, a founding member of the AFDL.[75] While some detainees were [[Summary execution]] or tortured to death, others were held for over three years and released only after a government-issued general amnesty.[75]
As part of its military alliance with Angola, the Kinshasa government also acted against members of the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC), a separatist movement advocating independence for the Angolan province of Cabinda.[75] Between 1998 and 1999, the DRC's security forces shuttered FLEC offices in Kinshasa and arrested numerous Cabindan militants.
Following the [[Assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] on 16 January 2001, the Democratic Republic of the Congo entered a new phase in the protracted national crisis.
Central to his early agenda was the de-escalation of armed conflict and the promotion of national reconciliation, particularly through the organization of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (ICD).[76] This initiative aimed to convene representatives from the government, rebel movements, political opposition, and civil society in a comprehensive peace process.[76] In March 2001, the [[MONUSCO]] (MONUC) deployed personnel to key conflict zones to oversee compliance with the [[Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement]].
The formal opening of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue took place on 25 February 2002 in [[Sun City (South Africa)]], [[South Africa]].
Under its terms, Rwanda agreed to withdraw its troops from Congolese territory in return for the disarmament and repatriation of Hutu militias, including the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR).[76]  A parallel agreement was signed with Uganda in [[Luanda]] on 6 September 2002, outlining a withdrawal plan for Ugandan forces and aiming to restore stability in the war-torn [[Ituri Province]].[76] By the end of that year, the disengagement of foreign military forces had begun, with troops from Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia initiating their withdrawal.
The culmination of these efforts was the signing of the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement in [[Pretoria]] on 17 December 2002.
The accord laid the foundation for a transitional [[Power sharing]] government and the integration of former belligerents into a unified national army.[76] Despite its ambitions, the peace process remained vulnerable to setbacks.
His controversial victory in the [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] triggered widespread unrest in the capital, prompting the deployment of [[European Union Military Operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2006)]] to support the MONUC in maintaining order.[77][78] Further unrest emerged in 2016 when the [[Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] announced a two-year delay in holding new presidential elections.
Kinshasa is strategically situated on the southern bank of the expansive [[Pool Malebo]], spanning 9,965 square kilometers, configured in a grand crescent shape atop a low-lying, flat terrain with an average elevation hovering around 300 meters.[80][81] Positioned between latitudes 4° and 5° and longitudinal coordinates 15° to 16°32 east, Kinshasa is flanked by the provinces of [[Mai-Ndombe Province]], [[Kwilu Province]], and [[Kwango]] to the east, while the [[Congo River]] delineates its western and northern boundaries, naturally demarcating the border with the [[Republic of the Congo]].
To the south, it is demarcated by the [[Kongo Central]].[82]
The Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the [[Nile]] and has the continent's greatest [[Discharge (hydrology)]].
As a [[Waterway]] it provides a means of transport for much of the [[Congo Basin]]; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and [[Kisangani]]; many of its tributaries are also navigable.
The river is an important source of [[Hydroelectric power]], and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population.[83]
Topographically, Kinshasa has a [[Marsh]], [[Alluvial plain]], with altitudes ranging from 275 to 300 meters, along with hilly terrain that elevates from 310 to 370 meters.[84][82][85] The city has four principal features: the Malebo Pool, a vast expanse of water with islands and islets; the Kinshasa Plain, which is a highly [[Urban area]], but susceptible to drainage issues; the Terrace, which is a series of low ridges overlooking the plain; and the Hills Area, which is characterized by deep valleys and [[Cirque]]-shaped formations.[82]
The Malebo Pool spans over 35 kilometers in length and 25 kilometers in width and is encircled by [[Ngaliema]] commune to the west and [[Maluku, Kinshasa]] to the east, traversing through [[Gombe, Kinshasa]], [[Barumbu]], [[Limete]], [[Masina, Kinshasa]], and [[Nsele]] communes.[82] The Kinshasa Plain has a banana-like shape and is surrounded by eastward-oriented hills.
Comprising mainly [[Sand]] alluvial deposits, this plain covers an area of about 20,000 hectares and hosts some of the city's most densely populated and urbanized communes,[82][86] such as Limete, [[Kalamu]], [[Bandalungwa]], [[Ngiri-Ngiri]], [[Kinshasa (commune)]], Barumbu, and [[Lingwala]].
Despite its urban potential, the plain is highly vulnerable to seasonal [[Flood]] and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)]] due to inadequate [[Storm drain]] infrastructure, with recurrent inundation occurring during the [[Wet season]].[86]
The Terrace is mainly situated in the city's western expanse, between [[Ndjili, Kinshasa]] and [[Mont Ngafula]].
It comprises stony blocks of soft [[Sandstone]] and [[Silicon dioxide]]-covered yellow [[Clay]], topped with brown [[Silt]], and ranges from 10 to 25 meters in height.
These hills reach heights surpassing 700 meters and exhibit gentle, rounded contours sculpted by local rivers.[82] While their eastern counterparts may reflect remnants of the [[Batéké Plateau]], their origins in the west and south remain enigmatic.[82] This region forms a natural amphitheater shaped by river [[Erosion]] processes, which have been exacerbated by anthropogenic activities, often resulting in significant [[Environmental degradation]].[86] Communes located within or adjacent to these hilly areas include Mont-Ngafula, [[Bumbu]], [[Selembao]], [[Kisenso]], and Ngaliema.
In addition, [[Makala]] and [[Ngaba]], although partially located within the plains, gradually ascend into the adjacent highlands.[86]
Kinshasa's hydrographic landscape is defined by an intricate and predominantly [[Drainage system (geomorphology)#Dendritic drainage pattern]] network of rivers and valleys that converge toward the Pool Malebo on the Congo River.
This fluvial system, which predominantly flows from the southern and southwestern highlands toward the north and northeast, is shaped by the region's topographical gradient and its underlying lithological structure.[87] The city's current hydrological dynamics are the cumulative result of long-term [[Tectonics]] shifts, [[Sediment]] processes, and [[Climate variability and change]] that have defined the development of [[Drainage system (geomorphology)]] over [[Geologic time scale]].[87]
The hydrographic system is composed of two main categories of rivers: [[Allochthonous]] (originating outside the city) and autochthonous (local or internal to the city).
The allochthonous rivers, which include the [[Ndjili River]], N'sele, and the Pool Malebo, form the city's eastern and northern boundaries.[87] These rivers have their sources far beyond the city's southern hills and generally flow in a south-to-north direction.
The N'djili River, in particular, is prone to recurrent [[Season]] [[Flood]] in its lower reaches, frequently disrupting critical infrastructure.[87] In contrast, the autochthonous rivers, such as the Funa, [[Lukunga River]], Bombo, Mai-Ndombe, and Mbale, are generated from localized watersheds scattered throughout the urban area.[87][82][88][89] These rivers often carve deeply incised valleys, especially in the elevated southern regions.
The Funa River is commonly but inaccurately referred to as the [[Kalamu]], a misnomer derived from the [[Teke languages]]-Humbu term for "[[Stream]]".[87]
The current hydrographic network overlays an ancient system, likely dating back to the [[Tertiary period]], which originally drained from south to north but was subsequently modified by tectonic deformation following the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Peneplanation]].
These geodynamic changes reoriented some rivers east-west in the eastern parts of the [[Congo Basin]] and west-east in the west.[87] Traces of this paleonetwork persist in the form of broad, flat-bottomed valleys known as dambos or dembos, which emerged during the [[Holocene]].
Characterized by diffuse channels and lacking pronounced [[Stream bed]], these depressions often remain [[Waterlogging (agriculture)]] throughout the year due to the persistent [[Upwelling]] of the [[Groundwater]] [[Water table]].[87] In recent centuries, however, increased hydrological stress, marked by heightened peak [[Runoff (hydrology)]], has induced the incision of more distinct channels within these formerly [[Marsh]] landscapes.[87] This hydrological transformation is evidenced by a marked rise in surface runoff and a reduction in [[Infiltration (hydrology)]] retention, resulting in flashier hydrographs, more frequent flood events, and accelerated [[Erosion]] processes.[87] Recent studies estimate Kinshasa's runoff coefficient has increased to approximately 13%, a stark contrast to the near-zero levels before urban expansion and [[Land-use change]].[87]
Closely connected to the surface drainage network are the city's groundwater systems, particularly the perched [[Aquifer]] found in its permeable [[Sandstone]] substratum.[87] These aquifers, often extending beyond the limits of their corresponding surface [[Catchment hydrology]], are sustained by deep [[Percolation]] facilitated by the sandy and porous characteristics of the regional soils.[87] During the [[Dry season]], rivers are primarily fed by these underground aquifers, which are recharged during the [[Wet season]].
Early seasonal rains are absorbed into the soil and do not contribute to surface runoff until the retention threshold is surpassed, at which point excess water seeps downward to replenish groundwater reserves.[87] The region's high [[Permeability of soils]] also facilitates the formation of erosion cirques, particularly on steep slopes where groundwater undercutting and concentrated surface runoff progressively destabilize hillsides, often culminating in [[Landslide]].[87] These geomorphic hazards have become increasingly pronounced in Kinshasa's rapidly urbanizing fringe zones, where informal settlement expansion, [[Deforestation]], and inadequate [[Land-use planning]] intensify environmental vulnerability.[87]
The soils of Kinshasa predominantly belong to the Arenoferrasol classification,[90][91] characterized by fine-textured sands with [[Clay]] content typically below 20%, low [[Organic matter]], and saturated absorbent complexes.[82] These soils exhibit a strong [[Acid]] and are chemically deficient.[87] Despite their limited nutrient availability, they experience regular rainfall for approximately eight to nine months annually, resulting in significant leaching and intense [[Hydrolysis]] of soil [[Mineral]].
This extended exposure to precipitation adversely affects [[Soil fertility]] and agricultural potential.[87]
Geologically, Kinshasa rests on a [[Precambrian]] basement complex, composed predominantly of finely stratified red [[Sandstone]] often containing [[Feldspar]] minerals.[82] These geological formations are prominently visible at the base of the rapids near Mount Ngaliema and to the south of the N'djili River, where they display considerable resistance to erosion.[82]
The region's diverse geological substrata have a notable impact on local [[Soil#Composition]].
[[Schist]]-[[Limestone]] formations, along with older [[Lithology]] associated with the West-Congolian Orogeny, give rise to yellow, clay-rich soils that are largely sterile, exhibiting low permeability directly correlated with their [[Sand]] content.[87] Conversely, schist-sandstone and clay-limestone substrates produce yellow to light brown clayey sands.
Although these soils demonstrate slightly improved permeability, they still possess low fertility and minimal agricultural utility.[87] Fertile soils are primarily located within [[Alluvium]] and [[Colluvium]] deposits, where sediment accumulation enhances nutrient content and moisture retention.[87]
In elevated terrains and along the slopes of deeply incised valleys, hydric erosion actively reshapes the schist-sandstone relief and ancient [[Massif]].
Kinshasa's vegetation consists of gallery [[Forest]], [[Savanna]], and semi-[[Aquatic plant]] to [[Aquatic plant]] communities, particularly within the valleys surrounding the Pool Malebo.[82] The hilly zones of the region were originally dominated by grassland species, notably [[Loudetia#species]] and [[Schizachyrium]], which are characteristic tufted hemicryptophytes.[87] However, the natural vegetation has undergone substantial transformation due to [[Human impact on the environment]], most notably [[Urban sprawl]].
As the city expanded, inhabitants introduced a range of [[Fruit]]-bearing trees and [[Ornamental plant]], often cultivated as living hedges.[87]
The gallery forests, typically aligned along principal watercourses and occupying humid valleys associated with the Guineo-Congolese ombrophile-type, have experienced progressive degradation.[82] These once-continuous forest belts have been reduced to fragmented pre-forest fallows, consisting of [[Secondary growth]] of varying maturity and structure.[82] Historical vegetation mapping reveals that Kinshasa's [[Forest cover]] declined significantly over the latter half of the 20th century: from 46% in 1960 to 36% in 1982, and plummeting further to just 15% by 1987.[87] In parallel, the coverage of forest–savanna mosaics and terrestrial [[Grassland]] formations expanded, rising from 48% in 1960 to 56% in 1982, and reaching 64% by 1987.[87] In contrast, areas dominated by aquatic and [[Swamp]] vegetation remained relatively stable throughout this period.[87]
Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums.[92] The older and wealthier part of the city (ville basse) is located on a flat area of [[Alluvium]] near the river, while many newer areas are found on the [[Erosion]] red soil of surrounding hills.[2][77] Older parts of the city were laid out on a geometric pattern, with de facto racial segregation becoming de jure in 1929 as the European and African neighborhoods grew closer together.
[[Urban planning]] of the 1920s–1950s featured a [[Cordon sanitaire (politics)]] or buffer between the white and black neighborhoods, which included the central market as well as parks and gardens for Europeans.[93]
The Mission Française d'Urbanisme drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for [[Automobile]] transportation but did not predict the city's significant population growth.
Thus much of the [[Urban structure]] has developed without guidance from a master plan.
According to [[UN-Habitat]], the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year.
It describes many of the new neighborhoods as [[Slum]], built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure.[94] Nevertheless, spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the [[Grid plan]] of the original city.[92]
Kinshasa is both a city (ville in French) and a province, one of the 26 [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
Nevertheless, it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 [[Communes of Kinshasa]] (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings.[95] [[Maluku, Kinshasa]], the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the 9,965 km2 (3,848 sq mi) total land area of the city-province,[28] with a population of 200,000–300,000.[92] The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions.
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kinshasa has a [[Tropical wet and dry climate]] (Aw).
Kinshasa lies south of the [[Equator]], so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June.
Kinshasa is the most populous city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with its metropolitan area estimated to host approximately 17.8 million people as of mid-2025.[103][104] It ranks as the [[List of cities and towns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[List of urban areas in Africa by population]] in Africa, and the [[List of national capitals by population]] globally.
In 1889, the population of Kinshasa was recorded at a mere 5,000.[105] By 1910, this figure had doubled to 10,000, and by 1930, it escalated to 39,530, driven by an annual increase of approximately 4,700 residents.[106] Between 1935 and 1945, the annual growth rate increased from 1.1% to 1.5%, largely attributable to economic revitalization efforts associated with [[Belgian Congo in World War II]], which necessitated significant labor forces to support wartime industries mandated by the colonial administration.[106] During the 1940s, the city's population surged from 50,000 to over 200,000.[107] By 1960, coinciding with [[Congolese Independence Speech]], Kinshasa expanded to cover 5,500 hectares and approximately 400,000 residents were recorded.[108] Following independence, the city experienced heightened [[Rural flight]], population displacement due to armed conflicts, and a natural annual population increase of 3.8%.[108] The national census of 1984 recorded 2.6 million residents,[109] while estimates for 2005 varied between 5.3 million and 7.3 million.[92] By 2015, the population approached 12 million, placing Kinshasa among the world's largest metropolises.[106]
According to [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme]], the city receives an average of 390,000 new migrants annually, many fleeing conflict or economic hardship.[111] Projections anticipate that Kinshasa's metropolitan population will reach 35 million by 2050, 58 million by 2075, and 83 million by 2100, making it one of the largest projected urban areas on the planet.[112]
Other groups closely linked to Kinshasa's early history include the [[Yaka people]], Banunu, and [[Yanzi people]], primarily from Kongo Central.
The city's rapid urbanization has been driven largely by [[Internal migration]].
Beginning during the colonial era and intensifying after independence in 1960, waves of Congolese from various provinces moved to Kinshasa in search of economic opportunity, political stability, and access to education and services.[115] This demographic surge was channeled through two principal corridors: a river route from northern and central Congo and a road route through [[Bandundu Province]] and Kongo Central.
The [[Lari people (Congo)]], from the Republic of the Congo, settled on fertile vacant lands and introduced new agricultural practices, including vegetable gardening.[115] Equally salient was the arrival of the Coastmen, or Ndingari, a term for [[West Africa]] migrants from present-day [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[Benin]], [[Guinea]], and [[Togo]].
Predominantly Muslim, they were active in commerce, public works, and artisanal trades.[115] They also influenced the city's cultural makeup by introducing [[African wax prints]] and socio-familial practices including [[Polygamy]].[115] Among the most demographically and culturally prominent expatriate communities are the Zombo, originally from [[Maquela do Zombo]] in Angola's [[Uíge Province]].
As the most populous foreign African demographic in Kinshasa, the Zombo initially migrated as traders and laborers.[115] From the 1950s onward, they were extensively conscripted to work at the port of [[Compagnie Industrielle et de Transports au Stanley Pool]] (Compagnie Industrielle et de Transport au Stanley Pool), where their primary responsibilities included the handling and conveyance of colonial commodities such as palm derivatives, copal resin, cotton, and ivory.[115]
Outside the workplace, they introduced door-to-door commerce in indigenous neighborhoods, selling rice, doughnuts, and beans, a practice that evolved into mobile street vending using handmade carts (pousse-pousse).[115] Their numbers escalated markedly during World War II, spurred by both economic incentives in the Belgian Congo and repressive governance in Angola under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].
The authoritarian policies of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)]] regime, particularly the brutal enforcement tactics of the [[PIDE]] (Portuguese secret police), pushed many Angolans to seek refuge in Kinshasa.[115] Belgian colonial authorities, constrained by porous borders and entrenched kinship networks among the [[Kongo people]] across both nations, were largely ineffectual in stemming this migratory tide.[115]
Avoiding repatriation, they raised successive generations in Kinshasa, where they assimilated both culturally and linguistically.[115] Youths often enlisted in the [[Force Publique]], while their elders gained renown for frugality, temperance, and entrepreneurial self-sufficiency.[115] Over time, many transitioned into artisanal vocations and small-scale manufacturing, introducing innovations such as handcrafted women's footwear fashioned from repurposed automobile tires.[115]
The official language is French (See: [[African French#Kinshasa French]]).
Kinshasa is the largest officially [[Francophonie]] city in the world, though many residents struggle to speak it.[116][117][118] Although [[Lingala]] is widely used as a spoken [[National language]], French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes.
People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages ([[Kongo language]], [[Lingala]], [[Tshiluba]] or [[Swahili language]]) among themselves.[119] Kinshasa hosted the 14th [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] Summit in October 2012.[120]
Founded on 1 August 1881, as Léopold II's Station, Kinshasa has maintained a distinct administrative status over time, eventually becoming the administrative center for the [[Stanley Pool District]], Haute-N'sele, and Panzi-Kasaï.[121] A [[Royal order]] promulgated on 11 April 1914 instituted a territorial reform in the [[Belgian Congo]], reaffirming Kinshasa's dual role as the colonial capital and the central administrative seat for the districts of [[Bas-Congo District]], [[Kwango District]], [[Kasai District]], [[Sankuru District]], and Léopoldville.[121] In 1941, Legislative Ordinance No. 293/AIMO of 25 June granted Kinshasa official city status and established an Urban Committee.
Following Congolese independence, the colonial charter was replaced by the Fundamental Law of 19 May 1960, which designated Kinshasa as a neutral city and the political seat of national institutions.[121] This legal evolution culminated in Ordinance No. 68/024 of 20 January 1968, which granted Kinshasa the same politico-administrative status comparable to that of the provinces, thus expanding its [[Communes of Kinshasa]].
Pursuant to Article 2 of Law No. 08/012 of 31 July 2008, a province is defined as a political and administrative component of the national territory endowed with legal personality and managerial autonomy over its human, economic, financial, and technical resources.[122][121] Kinshasa exercises its constitutional mandates through two principal organs: the [[Provincial Assembly of Kinshasa]] and the Provincial Government.[121]
According to Article 7 of the same law, the [[Provincial Assembly of Kinshasa]] serves as the city's [[Legislative body]].
Its core prerogatives include enacting laws (by way of edicts), electing the provincial governor and vice-governor, and overseeing the provincial government.[122][121] Comprising 48 deputies elected by [[Universal suffrage]], the Assembly is administratively structured with a Bureau composed of a [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Vice-presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Questeur, [[Rapporteur]], and Deputy Rapporteur.[121] The Assembly's legislative authority and procedural framework are outlined in Articles 11, 12, and 13 of Organic Law No. 08/016 from 7 October 2008, which governs decentralized territorial entities.[122][121]
The provincial executive branch is constituted by the [[List of governors of Kinshasa]], the Vice-Governor, and a cabinet of provincial ministers.
The 24 communes are recognized as administrative subdivisions of the city, each further divided into smaller entities known as [[Communes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (neighborhoods).
Every commune is managed by a Bourgmestre and their Deputy, and each is provisioned with public services such as [[Civil registration]] (État civil), sanitation, and general population services.
These are supported by technical services representing central ministries, made available to municipal authorities to enable the exercise of devolved functions.[126] These technical services include [[Urban planning]] and development, rural infrastructure, [[Agriculture]], [[Fishery]] and [[Livestock]], [[Public health]], education, [[Environmental protection]], [[Renewable energy]], finance, budget, [[Demographic statistics]], and more.[126] Additionally, specialized branches such as the [[Agence nationale de renseignements (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] (ANR), the [[Direction Générale de Migration]] (DGM), and the Commissariat Communal of the [[Congolese National Police]] maintain a presence at the communal level.[126]
These quartiers vary in structure depending on whether they fall within formally planned urban zones or more informally developed areas.[126] Popular [[Peri-urbanisation]] neighborhoods often exceed the size of planned residential districts and represent the core of the city's urban makeup.
As of 2015, the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo]] (MLC) held legislative predominance; however, the [[2023 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election#Provincial assemblies]] resulted in a power shift in favor of the presidential coalition, the [[Sacred Union of the Nation]] (USN), led by President [[Félix Tshisekedi]]'s [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress]] (UDPS), which secured 14 seats.[121] Daniel Bumba assumed the governorship on 21 June 2024.[127] Kinshasa wields sovereign powers, encompassing the authority to issue [[Democratic Republic of the Congo passport]] and to act on behalf of the country in international forums.[77] The city also hosts the headquarters of the [[MONUSCO]] (MONUSCO), formerly known as MONUC.[128] In 2016, the United Nations bolstered its peacekeeping presence in Kinshasa in response to civil unrest related to President [[Joseph Kabila]]'s controversial extension of power.[129]
In addition to state institutions, international and [[Non-governmental organization]] exert significant influence on local development and governance.[130] The Belgian development agency, [[Enabel]], has been a key actor since 2016 through its sponsorship of the Programme d'Appui aux Initiatives de Développement Communautaire (PAIDECO), a €6 million initiative aimed at stimulating economic development in the region.
The initial implementation took place in [[Kimbanseke]], a densely populated hill commune with an estimated population of nearly one million.[131] In a strategic effort to address urban overcrowding and stimulate regional development, the provincial government established the Comité Stratégique pour la Supervision du Projet d'Extension de la Ville de Kinshasa (CSSPEVK) in October 2023.
During its economic peak, often nostalgically referred to as la belle époque, the city's industrial activities spanned diverse domains including [[Food processing]], [[Textile]], [[Metallurgy]], and [[Assembly line]] production.[135] These industries produced goods for [[Consumption (economics)]] and international export.
Surveys conducted between 1974 and 1977 indicated that 33.7% of Kinshasa's working population held positions as executives or skilled laborers, with respective shares of 6.5% and 27.2%.[135] In terms of industrial concentration, Kinshasa in 1977 accounted for 49.9% of the country's [[Manufacturing]] industries.[86] It ranked second in [[Secondary sector]] activity with 18%, following [[Katanga Province]], which held 67.3%.
In the [[Tertiary sector]], Kinshasa ranked first with 27.3%, followed by Katanga at 22%.
The city also hosted 22.8% of all [[Company register]] nationwide, compared to 18% in Katanga.[86] By 1980, an estimated 412,000 people were in stable employment, supporting an average household of six.
However, by the 1990s, inflation and economic deterioration significantly diminished [[Purchasing power]].[135] Studies revealed that by 1988, only 20% of workers could meet basic [[Cost of living]] on their wages, and by 1990, Kinshasa had become more expensive to live in than other interior cities of the country.[135] In 1977, wages could cover 62% of basic needs and 51% of family needs; these figures declined steeply in the subsequent decades.[135]
Subsequent years of [[Political decay]] and warfare further paralyzed the city's already weakened economic sectors.[135] Since then, industrial activity in Kinshasa has largely stagnated or been dismantled altogether.
The city's rapidly expanding population, combined with a shortage of economic reintegration mechanisms for [[Graduate unemployment]] from technical and tertiary institutions, has worsened the unemployment crisis.[135] The dismantling of the industrial sector has been significant, with much of the wage-earning population absorbed into the [[Informal economy]].
In 2022, Kinshasa's GDP exceeded initial expectations by expanding 8.5%, as reported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).
The [[Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the DRC has been instrumental in maintaining a positive economic outlook, even amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].
[[Raw material]] exports, particularly [[Cobalt]] and [[Copper]], have experienced historically high prices, resulting in substantial investment in the industry.
Despite facing external challenges, including the repercussions of the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]], the DRC has shown [[Fiscal sustainability]].
There are many other industries, such as [[Trust Merchant Bank]], located in the heart of the city.
Although home to only 13% of the DRC's population, Kinshasa accounts for 85% of the [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as measured by gross domestic product.[94] A 2004 investigation found 70% of inhabitants employed informally, 17% in the public sector, 9% in the formal private sector, and 3% other, of a total 976,000 workers.
Most new jobs are classified as informal.[92] By the end of 2022, Kinshasa's [[Foreign exchange reserves]] had seen a significant improvement, soaring past $4.5 billion.
The DRC benefits from support and partnerships with several global organizations and financial institutions, including the IMF, [[World Bank]], [[African Development Bank]], [[European Union]], [[China]] and [[France]].[138]
The [[People's Republic of China]] has been heavily [[China–Democratic Republic of the Congo relations]] since the 1970s, when they financed the construction of the [[Palais du Peuple (Kinshasa)]] and backed the government against rebels in the [[Shaba I]].
In 2007–2008 China and Congo signed an agreement for an $8.5 billion loan for infrastructure development.[140] [[Chinese people in the DRC]] are gaining an increasing share of local marketplaces in Kinshasa, displacing in the process formerly successful Congolese, West African, Indian, and Lebanese merchants.[141]
Kinshasa is home to several education institutes, covering a wide range of disciplines, including [[Civil engineering]], [[Nursing]], and [[Journalism]].
Located in Kinshasa are the [[National Museum of the Democratic Republic of Congo]] and the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts (Kinshasa)]].[147]
Kinshasa has a flourishing music scene which, since the 1960s, has operated under the patronage of the city's elite.[77] The [[Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste]], formed in 1994, began using improved musical instruments and has since grown in means and reputation.[148]
Adrien Mombele, a.k.a. Stervos Niarcos, and musician [[Papa Wemba]] were early exemplars of the mikiliste style.[77] [[La Sape]], a linked cultural trend also described as [[Dandy]], involves wearing flamboyant clothing.[149]
Among the [[Places of worship]], which are predominantly [[Christianity]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Kimbanguist Church]], [[Baptist Community of Congo]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Baptist Community of the Congo River]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[The Salvation Army]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] which has a temple and over 100 congregations in Kinshasa, [[Presbyterian Community in Congo]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).[151] There are also [[Islam]] mosques.
The 2023 [[World Press Freedom Index]] rated the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 48.55%.[154] State-run channels generally provide minimal political content, and restrictive regulations limit [[Investigative journalism]].
Mirador TV is owned by Michel Ladi Luya, a former Member of Parliament and newspaper publisher.[153][155] Digital Congo TV was co-founded by [[Croats]] businessman Nicolas Vazonne and [[Jaynet Kabila]], twin sister of then-President Joseph Kabila.[153] Africa TV is associated with [[Azarias Ruberwa]], a former vice president and [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], and [[Eugène Serufuli Ngayabaseka]], the then-governor of [[North Kivu]].
CCTV (Canal Congo Télévision) and Canal Kin are linked to [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].[153] While many of these channels deny formal political affiliations, their ownership structures suggest otherwise.[153] Not all stations are politically aligned.
Neutral and independent outlets such as [[Antenne A]] and Congoweb TV contribute to a more balanced media environment.
[[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise]] remains the primary public broadcaster with nationwide reach, while other widely viewed stations include [[Radio Television Groupe Avenir]] ([[Radio Television Groupe Avenir]]), Digital Congo TV, Mirador TV, Congoweb TV, and Antenne A.[153]
The [[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise]] operates multiple channels, RTNC1, RTNC2, RTNC3, and RTNC4, providing news, cultural programming, and public service broadcasts.
The [[United Nations]]-supported [[Radio Okapi]], jointly managed with [[MONUSCO]], is also based in the city and is widely regarded for its balanced reporting.[155][156] Other notable broadcasters include Top Congo FM, RTGA, Radio Télévision Message de Vie (RTMV), Raga FM, and Digital Congo FM.
International broadcasters such as the [[BBC]] (on 92.6 FM), [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI), Africa Radio, [[China Radio International]], and [[Euronews]] are also present and broadcast according to the editorial policies of their parent organizations.[155][153]
Among the most prominent publications are [[L'Avenir (Congolese newspaper)]], L'Observateur, [[Le Potentiel]], Le Phare, Le Soft, La Conscience, and LeCongolais.[160]
[[Sports]], especially [[Association football]] and [[Martial arts]] are popular in Kinshasa.
The city is home to the country's national stadium, the [[Stade des Martyrs]] (Stadium of the Martyrs).
The [[AS Vita Club]], [[DC Motema Pembe]] and [[AS Dragons (Kinshasa)]] frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the Stade des Martyrs.
[[Dojo]] are popular and their owners influential.[77]
In 1974, Kinshasa hosted [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]], in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World [[Heavyweight]] title.
Kinshasa is home to the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] including:
The [[Central Bank of the Congo]] has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace.
Notable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and [[Hotel Memling]]; L'ONATRA, the building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the [[Limete Tower]].
The city's infrastructure for [[Tap water]] and electricity is generally in bad shape.[161] The [[Electric power distribution]] is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic [[Power outage]] are normal, and exposed [[Electrical wiring]] sometimes electrify pools of rainwater.[77][92]
[[Regideso]], the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and without uniform quality.
The housing market has seen rising prices and [[Renting]] since the 1980s.
[[Gated communities]] and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006.
[[Urban renewal]] projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement.[77][162] The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal [[Shantytown]] such as Pakadjuma.[111]
The [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city.
The city has two airports: [[N'djili Airport]] (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations.
[[N'Dolo Airport]], located close to downtown, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft.
Several international airlines serve Ndjili Airport including [[Kenya Airways]], [[South African Airways]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], [[Brussels Airlines]], [[Air France]] and [[Turkish Airlines]].
An average of ten international flights depart each day from N'djili Airport.[165] A small number of airlines provide domestic service from Kinshasa, for example [[Congo Airways]] and [[FlyCAA]].
The [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]][167] connects Kinshasa with [[Matadi]], Congo's Atlantic port.
According to the [[Société commerciale des transports et des ports]] (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June.
Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the [[Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo]] (Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo; SNCC).
Kinshasa is the major [[River port]] of the Congo.
The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about 7 km (4 mi) along the river, comprising scores of [[Quay]] and [[Jetty]] with hundreds of boats and barges tied up.
Ferries cross the river to [[Brazzaville]], a distance of about 4 km (2 mi).
River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as [[Kisangani]] and [[Bangui]].
There are road and [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway]] links to [[Matadi]], the [[Sea port]] in the Congo estuary 150 km (93 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean.
Since the [[Second Congo War]], the city has been striving to recover from disorder, with many youth gangs living and operating from Kinshasa's poorer areas.[168] The U.S. State Department in 2010 informed travelers that Kinshasa and other major Congolese cities are generally safe for daytime travel, but to beware of robbers, especially in traffic jams and in areas near hotels and stores.[169]
In 2024, the population of Makala Prison was reported at 15,000.[172]
The Congolese military intelligence organization, Détection Militaire des Activités Anti-Patrie ([[DEMIAP]]) operates the Ouagadougou prison in [[Kintambo]] commune with notorious cruelty.[171][173]
Kinshasa is [[Twin towns and sister cities]] with:
With its mix of culture, [[History of Kinshasa]], and lively atmosphere, Kinshasa has become a focus for filmmakers, musicians, writers, and artists.[186]
Kinshasa has been represented in various films, most notably in the film [[When We Were Kings]] (1996).
This documentary chronicles the historic [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]], held in Kinshasa in 1974.
In [[Viva Riva!]] (2010), directed by [[Djo Tunda Wa Munga]], the film offers a gritty portrayal of the city's underworld, showing the tension between [[Corruption]], [[Ambition (character trait)]], and [[Survival]].[190]
Kinshasa's social complexities are explored in [[Félicité (2017 film)]] (2017), directed by [[Alain Gomis]].
In 2019, [[The Widow (TV series)]] was released on Amazon Prime and the UK's ITV network.
Throughout history, authors have depicted the essence of Kinshasa in their writing, delving into its diverse [[Textile]], [[History]], and the [[Personal narrative]] of its residents.
[[Fiston Mwanza Mujila]]'s Tram 83 depicts the city's [[Nightlife]] while exploring themes of [[Postcolonialism]] [[Identity (social science)]] and the struggle for [[Social economy]] and [[Economic progressivism]].[193] Meanwhile, In [[In Koli Jean Bofane]]'s novel Congo Inc.: Bismarck's Testament the city serves as a microcosm of post-colonial Congo, exploring themes of globalization, political corruption, and environmental degradation.[194]
Artists like [[Franco Luambo]], [[Syran Mbenza]], [[Le Grand Kallé]], [[Nico Kasanda]], [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]], [[M'bilia Bel]], [[Madilu System]], [[Papa Noël Nedule]], [[Vicky Longomba]], [[Awilo Longomba]], [[Pépé Kallé]], [[Kanda Bongo Man]], [[Nyboma]], [[Defao]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Koffi Olomide]], [[Werrason]], [[Abeti Masikini]], [[Lokua Kanza]], [[Fally Ipupa]], and [[Ferré Gola]] have played a key role in popularizing [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on the international stage, many of whom began their careers in Kinshasa.[195][196][197] During the 1950s and 60s, the city became "[[Music industry and copyright in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]",[198] famously described by Gary Stewart in Rumba on the River as home to several Greek-owned studios where local artists could earn a living recording.[199] As Congolese rumba gained strength at the heart of Congolese life, Congolese-owned studios began to flourish.
In 1971, Mobutu Sese Seko enlisted [[TPOK Jazz]] to tour the nation in support of his [[Authenticité (Zaire)]] campaign, which sought to elevate local culture above Western influences.[199] However, this golden era was short-lived — Mobutu's authoritarian rule, combined with economic decline, falling copper prices, and high inflation, crippled Kinshasa's once-thriving music industry.[199] Many recording companies relocated abroad, especially to France and Belgium, while smaller domestic bands struggled to survive.
Nonetheless, Congolese music adapted creatively, most notably through [[Libanga]], a "[[Name-dropping]]" system where musicians earn income by mentioning patrons' names during performances, often accounting for most of their earnings.[199]
Tabu Ley Rochereau's 1971 track "Kinshasa" and Franco's 1980 composition "Kinshasa mboka ya makambo" ("Kinshasa, city of problems") reflect pride and criticism, capturing the spirit and struggles of urban life.[200] Cameroonian jazz saxophonist [[Manu Dibango]] echoed these themes in his track "Twist à Léo" (1960s), depicting the city's youth dancing to global rhythms during the twilight of the colonial era.[200] Following the upheavals of the 1990s, the city's music scene evolved dramatically: while some artists turned to [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Religious music]], others revived [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Traditional music and instruments]] through the tradi-modern movement, led by bands like Swédé Swédé and supported by Belgian producer [[Vincent Kenis]].[200] This led to the acclaimed [[Congotronics]] album series, which introduced international audiences to groups like [[Konono Nº1]], [[Kasai Allstars]], [[Staff Benda Bilili]], and [[Mbongwana Star]], who performed using handmade instruments and rudimentary amplification.[200]
In 2011, the DRC Music collective, curated by [[Damon Albarn]], recorded the collaborative album [[Kinshasa One Two]] in just five days, bringing together over fifty Congolese musicians and international producers to celebrate the city's musical ingenuity.[200] Among the featured artists was [[Jupiter Bokondji]], whose band Okwess International has championed bofenia rock, a genre drawing from Congo's immense ethnic and musical diversity.
His albums, such as Hotel Univers and Kin Sonic, incorporate Congolese rhythms, Western [[Rock music]] influences, and multilingual lyrics.[200][201][202] The city has also become a site for international artistic exchange, as since 2009, the [[Royal Flemish Theatre]] in Brussels has organized the Connexion Kin arts festival in [[Limete]], transforming it into a hub of cross-cultural collaboration between artists from Kinshasa and their European counterparts.[200] A notable product of this initiative was the acclaimed 2014 performance Coup Fatal, which combined Congolese guitar with classical [[Opera]], [[Jazz]], and contemporary choreography, earning praise at the [[Festival d'Avignon]] and in Brussels.[200]
In 2011, Belgian-Congolese rapper and singer [[Baloji (rapper)]], who was born in [[Lubumbashi]], returned to Kinshasa to record his album Kinshasa Succursale.
Blending Congolese rumba, [[Hip-hop]], [[Funk]], and [[Experimental music]], his style symbolizes a diasporic artists' reconnection with Kinshasa's musical roots while blending them with contemporary global influences.[200]
Kinshasa's [[Street art]] scene has gained recognition globally, with talented artists using their creations to express social and political messages.
[[Mural]] and [[Graffiti]], adorned with [[Color symbolism]], can be found throughout the city.[203][204][205]
The [[La Sape]] subculture, characterized by extravagant and dapper fashion choices, has become an emblem of [[Style (form of address)]], [[Self-expression values]], and [[Identity (social science)]] for the [[Sapeurs]] of Kinshasa.
It has gained [[Diplomatic recognition]] through the lens of well-known photographers such as Daniele Tamagni.
Musicians such as [[Papa Wemba]] have embraced La Sape as an essential part of their artistic identity.[206][208][209]
[[WWE]] wrestler [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] uses a running knee strike, called the Kinshasa, as his finisher, a reference to the eponymous city.
The move was previously named as Bomaye (which translated to "kill him") during his time in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] but was renamed in 2016 when he was signed with the WWE for trademark reasons.[210] Both Bomaye and Kinshasa are homages to Nakamura's mentor, [[Antonio Inoki]], who received Bomaye as a nickname from [[Muhammad Ali]] when Inoki and Ali fought in 1976, with Ali first hearing Bomaye in Kinshasa during the [[Rumble In The Jungle]].[210]
