[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva[b] (born Luiz Inácio da Silva; 27 October 1945), known [[Mononym]] as Lula, is a Brazilian politician, trade unionist and former metalworker who has served as the 39th [[President of Brazil]] since 2023.
A member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]], Lula was also the 35th president from 2003 to 2011.
Born in [[Pernambuco]], Lula quit school after second grade to work, and did not learn to read until he was ten years old.
As a teenager, he worked as a metalworker and became a [[Trade union]].
Between 1978 and 1980, he led the [[1978–1980 ABC Paulista strikes]] during Brazil's [[Military dictatorship in Brazil]], and in 1980, he helped start the Workers' Party during [[Redemocratization in Brazil]].
Lula was one of the leaders of the 1984 [[Diretas Já]] movement, which demanded direct elections.
In [[1986 Brazilian legislative election]], he was elected a federal deputy in the state of [[São Paulo (state)]].
He ran for president in [[1989 Brazilian presidential election]], but lost in the second round.
He also lost presidential elections in [[1994 Brazilian general election]] and [[1998 Brazilian general election]].
He finally became president in [[2002 Brazilian presidential election]], in a runoff.
In [[2006 Brazilian presidential election]], he was successfully re-elected in the second round.
Described as left-wing, his [[First presidency of Lula da Silva]] coincided with South America's first [[Pink tide]].
During his first two consecutive terms in office, he continued fiscal policies and promoted social welfare programs such as [[Bolsa Família]] that eventually led to GDP growth, reduction in external debt and inflation, and helping millions of Brazilians escape poverty.
He also played a role in foreign policy, both on a regional level and as part of global trade and environment negotiations.[1] During those terms, Lula was considered one of the most popular politicians in Brazil's history and left office with 80% approval rating.[2][3][4] His first term was also marked by notable corruption scandals, including the [[Mensalão scandal]].
After the [[2010 Brazilian general election]], he was succeeded by his former chief of staff, [[Dilma Rousseff]], and remained active in politics and gave lectures.
In July 2017, Lula was convicted on charges of [[Money laundering]] and corruption in the [[Operation Car Wash]] context, after which he spent a total of 580 days in prison.
He attempted to run in the [[2018 Brazilian presidential election]], but was disqualified under Brazil's [[Ficha Limpa]] law.
His two convictions were nullified in 2021 by the [[Supreme Federal Court]], in a ruling which also found serious biases in the first case against him, also annulling all other pending cases.
Once legally allowed to make another run for the presidency, Lula did so in the [[2022 Brazilian general election]] and ultimately defeated the incumbent [[Jair Bolsonaro]] in a runoff.
Luiz Inácio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945[5] (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in [[Caetés, Pernambuco]] (then a district of [[Garanhuns]]), 250 km (160 mi) from [[Recife]], capital of [[Pernambuco]], a state in the [[Northeast of Brazil]].
He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides Inácio da Silva and Eurídice Ferreira de Melo, farmers who had experienced famine in one of the poorest parts of the [[Agreste]].[6]  He was raised [[Catholic Church]].[7] Lula's mother was of [[Portuguese Brazilian]] and partial [[Italian Brazilian]] descent.[8] Two weeks after Lula's birth, his father moved to [[Santos, São Paulo]], with – though Eurídice was not aware of it – her younger cousin Valdomira Ferreira de Góis.[9]
In December 1952, when Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to [[São Paulo (state)]] to rejoin her husband.
After a journey of 13 days in a pau-de-arara (open [[Pickup truck#Pickup bed styles]]), they arrived in [[Guarujá]] and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira, with whom he had 10 more children.[10] Aristides's two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, his mother moved with him and his siblings to a small room behind a bar in [[São Paulo]].
Twice a [[Widower]], Lula has been married three times, and has a daughter from a fourth relationship.
Two months later, in May 1974, Lula married [[Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva]], a 24-year-old widow whom he had met the prior year.
Later that same year, he met and started a relationship with [[Rosângela Lula da Silva]], known as Janja.
The relationship only became public in 2019 while he was serving time in jail in [[Curitiba]], Paraná, on corruption charges.[19] Lula and Janja married on 18 May 2022.[20]
Lula is [[Catholic Church]].[21]
Inspired by his brother Frei Chico, a member of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]], Lula joined the [[Labour movement]] when he worked at Villares Metals, rising through the ranks.[27] He was elected in 1975, and re-elected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers' Union of [[São Bernardo do Campo]] and [[Diadema, Brazil]].
Both cities are located in the [[ABCD Region]], home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including [[Ford do Brasil]], [[Volkswagen do Brasil]], [[Toyota]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]].
In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major [[1978-1980 ABC Paulista strikes]].
[[Labour court]] found the strikes illegal, and in 1980, Lula was jailed for a month.
On 10 February 1980, a group of academics and union leaders, including Lula, founded the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with [[Progressivism]] ideas.[28][29][30][31] In 1983, he helped found the [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores]] (CUT) trade union association.[32]
Lula first ran for office in 1982 for the state government of [[São Paulo (state)]], but lost with 11% of the vote.
Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] urged him to continue on as a politician, during a trip by Lula to Cuba.[33][34] In the 1986 election, Lula won a seat in the [[National Congress of Brazil]] with the most votes nationwide.[35]
Lula advocated immediate land reform and that Brazil [[Default (finance)]] on its [[External debt]].
A minor candidate, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], quickly amassed support with a more business-friendly agenda and by taking emphatic anti-corruption positions.
He beat Lula in the second round of the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election]].
Former [[PSDB]] Minister of Finance [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] defeated Lula who received only 27% of the vote in the presidential elections in [[1994 Brazilian general election]], and again, by a somewhat smaller margin, as Lula garnered only 32% of the vote in [[1998 Brazilian general election]].
An article in [[The Washington Post]] said that before 2002, Lula had been a "strident [[Union organizer]] known for his bushy beard and [[Che Guevara]] T-shirts".[37] In the 2002 campaign, Lula abandoned both his informal clothing style and his platform plank that Brazil should not pay its foreign debt unless it links the payment to a prior thorough audit.
Lula in  the [[2002 Brazilian general election]], defeated PSDB candidate [[José Serra]] in a runoff, to become the country's first [[Leftist]] president following the fall of the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil]].[38] In the [[2006 Brazilian general election]], Lula won a [[Two-round system]] over the PSDB's [[Geraldo Alckmin]].[39]
In September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned Lula from running for president in [[2018 Brazilian general election]] due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with Brazil's [[Lei da Ficha Limpa]] law.[40] Instead, [[Fernando Haddad]] ran for president on the Workers Party ticket, and was defeated by [[Jair Bolsonaro]].[41]
Some wings of the Worker's Party disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties, and left the party to form other parties, such as during Lula's presidency, the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]].
Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents [[José Sarney]] and Fernando Collor, have been a cause of disappointment for some.[46]
It was financed by an increase in tax revenues, coupled with a decrease in government expenditures on both wages and on benefits paid to public employees, as well as a decrease in government expenditures on infrastructure.[52] The programme followed the lead of a project that had already been put into practice in 1995 by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, which was named [[Education policy in Brazil#Bolsa Escola]] (School Stipend).[53] It expanded that initiative with the new [[Fome Zero]] ("Zero Hunger") programme, which was part of the [[Bolsa Família]] (Family Allowance) plan.[54][55]
During Lula's first term, [[Undernutrition in children]] in Brazil decreased by 46%.
In May 2010, the UN [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) awarded Lula the title of "World Champion in the Fight against Hunger".[58] A number of other social projects were introduced during Lula's first presidency.[59]
More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of [[Favela]], and more than 40 billion in housing.
The government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupied the "risk zones", prone to floods or landslides; at the end of the day, however, at least 212 people died and at least 15,000 people were made homeless by the [[April 2010 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides]] alone.
Lula's first two terms coincided with a strong [[2000s commodities boom]].[61][62][63] This fueled an economic boom in Brazil, which in turn allowed Lula to spend heavily on social programmes and pay off a $15 billion IMF loan a year early.[61][62][63]
In the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of Lula taking drastic measures, and comparisons of him with [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]], increased internal market speculation.
This led to a drop in the value of the [[Brazilian real]], and a downgrade of Brazil's [[Credit rating]].[64] Lula chose [[Henrique Meirelles]] of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), a market-oriented economist, as head of the [[Brazilian Central Bank]].
As a former CEO of [[BankBoston]] he was well known to the market.[65]
Lula and his cabinet followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government in economics.[66] It renewed all agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on its own deals in 2001.
His government achieved a satisfactory primary [[Budget surplus]] in the first two years, as required by the IMF agreement, exceeding the target for the third year.
In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule.[67] The Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the 2005 [[Mensalão scandal]], which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.[68]
In June 2005, economist and attorney [[José Dirceu]], Lula's chief-of-staff since 2003, resigned after he was caught up in a massive corruption scheme in the legislature, the Mensalão corruption scandal.[69][70][71][72] In March 2006, Lula's finance minister [[Antonio Palocci]], who had continued the anti-inflation and pro-market policies of the previous centrist government, resigned due to his involvement in a corruption and [[Abuse of power]] scandal.[73][74][75] Lula then appointed [[Guido Mantega]], a PT economist, as finance minister.
Not long after the start of his second term, in 2007 Lula's government announced the [[Growth Acceleration Program]] (Programa de Aceleração de Crescimento, PAC), an investment programme which sought to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly.
The money pledged to be spent on this programme was to be around [[Brazilian real]] 500 billion (US $260 billion) over four years.
Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of [[Privatization]].[77] His administration created [[Public-private partnership]] concessions for seven federal roadways.[78] After decades with the largest [[Foreign debt]] among [[Emerging economies]], Brazil became a net creditor for the first time in January 2008.[79] By mid-2008, both [[Fitch Ratings]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] had elevated the classification of Brazilian debt from speculative to investment grade.
The [[2008 financial crisis]] might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, Lula declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little 'ripple' ("uma marolinha").
The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of Lula's reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.[81] In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to mitigate the [[2008 financial crisis]] with a large [[Economic stimulus]] lasting, at least, until 2014.[82] According to [[The Washington Post]]: "Under Lula, Brazil became the world's eighth-largest economy, [and] more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty ..."[37]
At the same time, in 2010 The Wall Street Journal noted that: "[Brazil's] [[Public sector]] is bloated and riddled with corruption.
The business environment is restrictive, with a labour code ripped from the pages of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s economic playbook.
In May 2008, environmental minister [[Marina Silva]] resigned, blamed "stagnation" in the government, after she lost disagreements with Lula when she opposed approval of new [[Hydroelectric dam]] in the Amazon and criticized Lula's [[Biofuels]] programme.[85]  Dr. Daniel Nepstad of the [[Woods Hole Research Center]] said the growing demand for biofuels may ultimately result in more Amazon deforestation.[86] In particular, environmentalists warn that while biofuels reduce emissions of [[Greenhouse gas]], they may well also trigger a significant expansion of the biofuel crops; that, in turn, may push agriculture deeper into forests, destroying habitat and [[Biodiversity]].[87]
The creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a decrease of around 75% in deforestation starting in 2004.[88] In Lula's first year in office, in 2003–04, 25,000 [[Square kilometer]] of Brazilian forest were destroyed, the second-worst devastation since 1977.[89] In late 2006, the Instituto Soicioambiental environmental group said that deforestation in Lula's first four years had been worse than in any four-year period since 1988.[90][89][91] By 2009, Brazil's Amazon destruction—though lower—was still about 7,000 square kilometers a year, larger than the US state of [[Delaware]].[92] Critics said, however, that Brazil's lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 was a function of the [[2008 financial crisis]].[93] Paulo Adario of [[Greenpeace]] said that it was a function not of efforts to protect the climate, but of the fact that the "demand for beef, soya and wood ha[d] dramatically fallen".[93]
In February 2010, Lula's government approved the construction of a controversial hydroelectric mega [[Belo Monte Dam]] in the middle of the Amazon rain forest in the Brazilian state of [[Pará]].[93] It was to be the third-largest hydroelectric dam in the world.[93] Environmental activists protested the building of the dam.[93] It was expected to cause a significant decline in the [[Water table]], resulting in significant losses of aquatic and terrestrial [[Fauna]], and adversely impact [[Aquatic mammal]].[94]  Approximately 20,000-40,000 indigenous people were to be resettled with little or no compensation, and 516 square kilometers (199 square miles) of rain forest were to be flooded for the dam's construction.[93][94]
He answered: [[Gandhi]], [[Che Guevara]], and [[Mao Zedong]].[95] Upon being asked to give additional examples, he added [[Fidel Castro]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] and saying about the latter: "I admire in a man the fire to want to do something, and then his going out to try to do it."[96][95]
Leading a large agricultural state, Lula generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and this position has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Cancún [[World Trade Organization]] talks in 2003 over [[G8]] agricultural subsidies.[97] Brazil played a role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and [[Colombia]], and made efforts to strengthen [[Mercosur]].[98] During the Lula administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003.
Brazil also provided UN peacekeeping troops and led a peacekeeping mission in [[Haiti]].[99]
According to [[The Economist]] of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites.
As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] and U.S. President [[George W.
Bush]].[100] Former [[Finance Minister]], and current advisor, Delfim Netto, said: "Lula is the ultimate pragmatist".[101]
From 2003 to 2010, Lula embraced China as central to reforming what he considered an unjust global order.[103] He intertwined the Chinese and Brazilian economies.[104][105][103]  Lula stated Brazil's commitment to the One China principle that is the position held by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the ruling [[Chinese Communist Party]], saying that the government of the People's Republic of China was the sole legal government representing the whole of China, including [[Taiwan]]—as part of China.[106]
Lula and Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] were longtime friends.[107][108] Under Lula, Brazil provided money and corporate support to Cuba.[109][110] The state-controlled Brazilian oil company [[Petrobras]] studied the possibility of drilling for oil off of Cuba, while the [[Odebrecht]] construction firm headed a revamp of the Cuban port of [[Mariel, Cuba]] into the island's main commercial port.[110][111] Brazil's state-run [[Brazilian Development Bank]] gave $300 million to Odebrecht to build new roads, rail lines, wharves, and warehouses at Mariel.[110] Brazil also offered Cuba up to $1 billion in [[Line of credit]] to pay for Brazilian goods and services.[111]
The conviction by an Iranian court of Iranian [[Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani]] for the crime of adultery, with a sentence in 2006 of execution by stoning, led to calls for Lula to intercede on her behalf.
The Iranian government declined his offer.[112][113] [[Mina Ahadi]], an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula's offer, but reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requested a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government.[114][115][116][117] [[Jackson Diehl]], deputy [[Editorial page]] editor of [[The Washington Post]], called Lula the "best friend of tyrants in the democratic world," and criticised his actions.[112] [[Shirin Ebadi]], Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate called Lula's comments a "powerful message to the Islamic Republic".[118]
In 2009, Lula warmly hosted Iranian president [[Ahmadinejad]], who made a controversial visit to Brazil.[119][120]  Some demonstrators expressed displeasure over Ahmadinejad's positions on human rights and his denial of [[The Holocaust]].[121]
In May 2010, Lula and Turkey's prime minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] negotiated a preliminary fuel swap agreement with the Iranian government on [[Uranium enrichment]], that ultimately failed.[122] The preliminary agreement that they presented to the United Nations was at odds with what the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and other countries viewed as necessary actions to stop Iran from obtaining [[Weapons grade]] materials.[122] Within hours of signing the agreement, Iran did an about-face and announced that it would continue to enrich some uranium.[123] U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] said Brazil was being "used" by Tehran.[123]  The [[UN Security Council]] ultimately rejected it when permanent member country representatives argued that "the swap proposal negotiated by Brazil and Turkey would leave Iran with enough material to make a nuclear weapon," and that "Iran intends to continue a new programme of enriching uranium to a higher level."[122][102] [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning journalist [[Thomas Friedman]] wrote: "Is there anything uglier than watching democrats sell out other democrats to a Holocaust-denying, vote-stealing Iranian thug just to tweak the U.S. and show that they, too, can play at the big power table?"[124] [[Moisés Naím]], editor in chief of [[Foreign Policy]] magazine and former Minister of Trade in Venezuela, said "Lula is a political giant, but morally he has been a deep disappointment."[124] In 2010, in addition, Brazilians largely disagreed with Lula as to how to handle Iran and Iran's nuclear weapons programme.[125] While Lula opposed additional international economic sanctions against Iran, of the 85% of Brazilians who opposed Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, two-thirds approved of tighter international sanctions on Iran to try to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.[125]
In 2003, Lula condemned the U.S.-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], saying that the United States had no right "to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world".[126] He said that "the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened the United Nations".[127]
Brazil, as a non-permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]], abstained from the vote authorising "all necessary measures" against Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].[128]  It opposed the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]].[128] Lula said: "These invasions only happen because the United Nations is weak."[128]
Lula was close with [[Venezuela]]'s president [[Hugo Chávez]], a close ally of Communist Cuba and an antagonist of the United States.[129][130] In November 2007, Lula defended Chávez as the democratic choice of his people.[130] He said: "There is no risk with Chávez."[130] Expressing his admiration for Chávez, he said "Only thanks to Chávez's leadership, the people [of Venezuela] have had extraordinary achievements," and that in 2008 that Chávez was "the best president the country has had in 100 years."[131] However, in 2010 Brazilians largely had a different view than Lula, as only 13% had at least some confidence in Chávez, while 70% had little or no confidence in him.[125]
After Lula was infuriated by a 9 May 2004, New York Times article that claimed he had a drinking problem, Brazil ordered the New York Times reporter, [[Larry Rohter]], to leave the country and revoked his visa because he had written a story "offensive to the honour of the president."[132][133] Lula said: "Certainly its author ...
it deserves action."[133]  Brazil's presidential palace threatened to take legal action against the New York Times, which stood by the story and said that the expulsion raised serious questions about [[Freedom of expression]] and [[Freedom of the press]] in Brazil.[133] No journalist had been expelled from Brazil since its military dictatorship ended in the mid-1980s.[133] Brazilian opposition senator [[Tasso Jereissati]] said: "This is ridiculous.
It's more like the immature act of a dictator of a third-rate republic..."[133] Brazil's second largest union, [[Força Sindical]], issued a statement expressing concern that: "it is a reaction typical of authoritarian governments that don't like contrary voices."[133] Despite criticism, on 13 May 2004, Lula said "he would not consider revoking the action."[133] The government subsequently changed its position, and allowed the reporter to remain.[134]
Lula's administration was plagued by numerous corruption scandals, notably the [[Mensalão scandal]] and Escândalo dos sanguessugas [pt] during Lula's first term.[136][137][138]
Among those convicted were [[Jose Dirceu]] (who was Lula's chief of staff and right-hand man from 2003 to 2005; he was sentenced to over 10 years in jail), and both the former head of Lula's Workers Party, [[Jose Genoino]], and its treasurer, [[Delubio Soares]].[71][140] Dirceu and officials [[Luiz Gushiken]] and [[Humberto Costa]] said that Lula was not involved.
[[Roberto Jefferson]] said that if Lula didn't "commit a crime by action, he committed it by omission."[141] But one of Lula's own party members, [[Arlindo Chinaglia]], alleged that Lula had been warned about the matter, and businessman [[Marcos Valério]], who was sentenced to more than 40 years in prison for his involvement in the scandal, alleged in testimony after he was convicted that Lula had authorized loans for the scheme and used some of the money to pay for his personal expenses.[142][143]
His administration was criticized for relying on local, right-of-centre political barons, like [[José Sarney]], [[Jader Barbalho]], [[Renan Calheiros]] and Fernando Collor to ensure a majority in [[Congress of Brazil]].
Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a "Federal Council of Journalists" (CFJ) and a "National Cinema Agency" (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for [[Electronic media]].
Before a [[G-20 summit]] in London in March 2009, Lula caused an uproar by declaring that the [[Great Recession]] was caused by "the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes, who before seemed to know everything, and now have shown they don't know anything".[146] He added: "I don't know any black or indigenous bankers."[147] He repeated the accusation the following month.[147]
When Italian far-left terrorist [[Cesare Battisti (1954)]] of the [[Armed Proletarians for Communism]], wanted for four murders, was arrested in Rio de Janeiro in March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice [[Tarso Genro]] granted him status as a political refugee.
In February 2009, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a resolution in support of Italy, and held a minute's silence in memory of Battisti's victims.
Italy planned to appeal to the [[International Court of Justice]] in the Hague, saying Brazil had breached an extradition treaty.[150] President Michel Temer revoked his status as a permanent resident in December, 2018 and an arrest warrant was issued; Battisti then entered Bolivia illegally, and was arrested and extradited from Bolivia in January 2019.[151]
Prosecutors alleged they helped pass Provisional Measure 471 (which was later converted into Law 12,218/2010) in 2009 in order to benefit the automotive companies [[Grupo Caoa]] and MMC.[152] On 21 June 2021, Judge Frederico Botelho de Barros Viana of the 10th Federal Court of Brasilia acquitted all the accused, saying that the prosecution did not convincingly demonstrate that the defendants were involved in a criminal conspiracy.[153]
In 2014, Brazil began Operação Lava Jato (English: [[Operation Car Wash]]), resulting in multiple arrests and convictions, including nine suits against Lula.
In April 2015, the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)]] of Brazil opened an investigation into allegations of [[Influence peddling]] by Lula, which alleged that between 2011 and 2014 he had lobbied for government contracts in foreign countries for the [[Odebrecht]] company and had also persuaded the Brazilian Development Bank to finance the projects in [[Ghana]], [[Angola]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Dominican Republic]].[154] In June 2015, [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], president of Odebrecht, was arrested on charges that he had paid politicians $230 million in bribes.[155] Three other company executives were also arrested, as well as the chief executive of [[Andrade Gutierrez]], another construction conglomerate.[156]
On 4 March 2016, as part of "Operation Car Wash", Brazilian authorities raided Lula's home.[157][158] After the raid, the police detained Lula for questioning.[159][160] A police statement alleged that Lula had collaborated in illegal bribes from the oil company [[Petrobras]] to benefit his political party and presidential campaign.[159] Prosecutor Carlos Fernando said, "The favours to Lula from big construction companies involved in the fraud at Petrobras were many and hard to quantify".[161] Lula said that he and his party were being politically persecuted.[162][163][164]
On 16 March 2016, Rousseff appointed Lula as her [[Chief of Staff of Brazil]], a position comparable to that of prime minister.
This would have shielded him from arrest due to the immunity that went with the position.[165] Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among close to seven hundred senior government officials enjoying special judicial standing, which means they can only be tried by Brazil's [[Supreme Federal Court]].
Supreme Court Judge [[Gilmar Mendes]] suspended Lula's appointment on the grounds that Rousseff was trying to help Lula circumvent prosecution.[166][167][168][169]
On 28 July 2016, Lula filed a petition with the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], a panel of experts, requesting that it provide a view on his accusation that Moro had violated his rights.
The Brazilian ambassador to the [[UK]] wrote: "The (Brazilian) judiciary is fully independent and due process of law is faithfully observed.
On 14 September 2016, prosecutors filed corruption charges against Lula, accusing him of being the mastermind or 'maximum commander of the scheme'.[172] On 19 September 2016, 13th Circuit ([[Paraná (state)]]) federal judge [[Sergio Moro]], who was leading the corruption probe, accepted an indictment for money laundering against Lula and his wife [[Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva]].
On 11 May 2017, Lula answered a summons by appearing in [[Curitiba]] and was questioned by Moro.
Lula was found guilty by the lower court of accepting R$3.7 million in bribes ($940,000 US) in the form of improvements to his beachfront house, made by construction company Grupo Metha [pt], which in turn received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]].[174] Lula also faced other charges, including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.[175][174] On 12 July 2017, [[Sergio Moro]] sentenced Lula to nine and a half years in prison.[176] Lula remained free pending his appeal.[177] Lula's lawyer accused the judge of bias and the judge replied that nobody, not even the former president, should be above the [[Rule of law]].[177]
On 5 April 2018, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted 6–5 to deny Lula's [[Habeas corpus]] petition.[180] The court ruled that Lula must begin serving his sentence relating to his 12 July 2017 graft conviction for taking bribes from an engineering firm in return for help to land contracts with state-run oil company [[Petroleo Brasileiro SA]], despite him not having exhausted all of his appeals, but rather only one appeal, at which the appellate court had unanimously upheld his sentence.[181][182][183] Brazilian financial markets rallied, as the decision increased the chances a market-friendly candidate winning the election.[183] Lula and his party vowed to continue his campaign from prison following the court's decision that he must surrender himself by 6 April.[184] The head of Brazil's army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, called for Lula to be placed behind bars.[185] Following Judge Moro's issuance of an arrest warrant for Lula on 6 April 2018, Lula appealed to the UN Human Rights Committee to – in addition to his primary case – take emergency action by asking the government of Brazil to prevent his arrest until he had exhausted all appeals, arguing that the Brazilian Supreme Court had narrowly adopted its ruling with only six votes against five, which "shows the need for an independent court"; the Committee ultimately denied Lula's request.[186][187] In June 2018, the Committee denied Lula's request.[188]
Lula failed to turn himself in at the scheduled time,[189] but he did so on the following day on 7 April 2018.[190] After Lula was imprisoned, protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil.[191] Lula's imprisonment led to the formation of the [[Free Lula Movement]].
On 8 July 2018, [[On-call]] weekend duty federal judge for the 4th region Rogério Favreto ordered Lula's release.[195] Moro said that Favreto did not have the authority to release Lula, and Favreto's ruling was overturned the same day by the Judge Pedro Gebran Neto, president of the 4th regional court.[196]
On 2 August 2018, Pope Francis received three former allies of Lula in Rome: [[Celso Amorim]], [[Alberto Fernández]] and [[Carlos Ominami]].[197] Later, the pope addressed a handwritten note to Lula (posted on his Twitter account) with the following text: "To Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with my blessing, asking him to pray for me, Francisco".[198]
On 9 June 2019, [[The Intercept]] published [[Vaza Jato]] [[Telegram (app)]] messages between the judge in Lula's case, [[Sergio Moro]], and the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, [[Deltan Dallagnol]], in which they allegedly conspired to convict Lula to prevent his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election.[199][200][201][202][203][204][205] Moro was accused of lacking impartiality in Lula's trial.[206] Following the disclosures, the resumption of legal proceedings was determined by the Supreme Court.[207] Moro denied any wrongdoing or [[Judicial misconduct]] during the course of Operation Car Wash and his investigation of Lula, claiming that the conversations leaked by The Intercept were misrepresented by the press and that conversations between prosecutors and judges are normal.[208] Moro became [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security (Brazil)]] after the election of president Jair Bolsonaro.
A group of 17 lawyers, ministers of Justice, and high court members from eight countries reacted to the leaks by describing former president Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release.[209] United States Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] said Lula should be released and his conviction annulled.
American Congressman [[Ro Khanna]] asked the Trump administration to investigate Lula's case, saying that "Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail".[210] A number of international intellectuals, activists and political leaders, including professor [[Noam Chomsky]] and 12 US Congressmen, complained that the legal proceedings appeared to be designed to prevent Lula from running for president in 2018.[211][212][better source needed] American talk show host [[Michael Brooks (political commentator)]], a vocal advocate for Lula, opined that Lula's imprisonment and Moro's alleged political motives had rendered the results of the 2018 election "fundamentally illegitimate".[213]
On 27 November, the Federal Regional Tribunal of Region 4 [pt] in [[Porto Alegre]] increased Lula's sentence to 17 years.[221]
On 8 March 2021, Judge [[Edson Fachin]] of the Supreme Federal Court annulled all convictions against Lula, ruling that the court in Curitiba, in [[Paraná (state)]] state, which convicted him lacked jurisdiction to do so because the crimes he was accused of did not take place in that state, as at the time Lula resided in the capital, Brasilia.[222] Justice Fachin said the cases against him should therefore be retried by a court in that city.[223] The judge did not rule as to whether Lula was guilty or not of the corruption charges.[222] On 15 April, a full Supreme Court upheld the ruling in an 8–3 decision.[224]
On 29 October 2011, it was announced that Lula, a former smoker, had a [[Malignant tumor]] in his [[Larynx]],[228] which was detected after his voice became unusually hoarse.[229]  He had [[Chemotherapy]] to treat the tumor,[230] and was later treated with [[Radiation therapy]]; his [[Laryngeal cancer]] went into remission.
On 21 January 2021, Lula tested positive for [[COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba]] while participating in the filming of an [[Oliver Stone]] documentary in Cuba, five days after arriving on the island.
He recovered without needing to be admitted to hospital.[232] On 13 March 2021, Lula received his first dose of the [[CoronaVac]] vaccine.[233]
In October 2023, Lula had [[Hip replacement]] for a [[Implant (medicine)]], replacing the top of his right [[Femur]] with an implant to treat his [[Arthrosis]].[234][235]
[236] He also had a [[Blepharoplasty]], a cosmetic plastic surgery to remove excess skin from both of his eyelids.[234][237][235]
In 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers' Party candidate for president again in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]].
In September, he led a caravan of supporters which travelled through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor was Lula's political ally [[Fernando Pimentel]].[238] While traveling through the [[South Region, Brazil]], the caravan became the target of protests.
In a poll conducted by [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics]] in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)]] candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] polling second with 15%.[240] Lula negotiated a national coalition with the [[Partido Comunista do Brasil]] and regional alliances with the [[Partido Socialista Brasileiro]].[241]
Actor [[Sérgio Mamberti]] read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence.
If Lula was declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with [[Manuela d'Ávila]] replacing Haddad as the vice-presidential candidate.[242]
In response to a petition from Lula, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] on 17 August 2018 suggested to the Brazilian government that it allow Lula to exercise his political rights.[243]
The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)]] candidate Jair Bolsonaro, by 52 to 32.[244]
Lula's [[Candidate]] was denied by the [[Superior Electoral Court]] on 31 August 2018 by a majority vote of the seven-judge panel.[245] On 11 September 2018, Lula officially withdrew  and was replaced by Fernando Haddad, whom Lula endorsed.[246]
In May 2021, Lula said that he would run for a third term in the October 2022 general election, against the incumbent President [[Jair Bolsonaro]].[247][248][249] He was 17% ahead of Bolsonaro in a poll in January 2022.[250] In April 2022, Lula announced that his running mate would be [[Geraldo Alckmin]], a three-term governor of São Paulo state who had run against Lula in the 2006 presidential elections.[251]
He became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms, the first since [[Getúlio Vargas]] to serve in non-consecutive terms, and the first to unseat an incumbent president.
Lula said that his main commitments were: the reconstruction of the country in the face of the economic crisis; democracy, sovereignty and peace; economic development and stability; fighting poverty; education; implementation of a National System of Culture and the expansion of housing programmes.[259] He held the presidency of the [[G20]] from 2023 (succeeding [[India]]) until the [[2024 G20 Rio de Janeiro summit]], where after this the presidency was handed over to [[South Africa]].[260][261]
On 23 October 2025, Lula announced that he would run for reelection as president in the [[2026 Brazilian general election]].[262]
In March 2023, Lula met in [[China]] with [[Paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]], and signed 15 memoranda of understanding and 20 agreements on a wide range of issues.[263] Lula gave a speech in which he said that no one would keep Brazil from improving its relationship with China—which was taken as a reference to the United States.[264][265] In January 2024, Lula reaffirmed to Director of the [[Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission]] [[Wang Yi]] his recognition of China's policy of "[[One China]]", under which China claims Taiwan.[266] [[Human Rights Watch]], in the meantime, cautioned Lula against cozying up to China, while remaining silent about [[Human rights in China]].[103][267][268]
In September 2023, Lula called Cuba a "victim" of an "illegal" [[United States embargo against Cuba]].[269][268] He also denounced the inclusion of Cuba on the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)]].[269][270]
In March 2023, Lula's administration allowed two [[Iranian Navy]] warships, [[Expeditionary Mobile Base]] [[IRIS Makran]] and [[Moudge-class frigate]] [[IRIS Dena]], to dock in Rio de Janeiro.[271][272][273] U.S. Ambassador to Brazil [[Elizabeth Bagley]] said that in the past the warships had facilitated terrorist activities, and US Senator [[Ted Cruz]] said that "the docking of Iranian warships in Brazil is a dangerous development and a direct threat to the safety and security of Americans."[273]
Lula endorsed admitting Iran into the [[BRICS]] organization, and in August 2023 met with Iranian president [[Ebrahim Raeisi]].[274][275] Lula stopped short of condemning [[Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran]].[275]
In June 2023, at an [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) summit, Lula tried to soften OAS criticism of Nicaragua's government, which was accused of repression and of violations of human rights and property rights.[276][277][278][279] Nicaragua's former ambassador to the OAS, [[Arturo McFields]], said that the proposed softening was "shameful," and that "President Lula is lying and telling another story that never existed in Nicaragua."[279]
In May 2023, he declined an invitation to the [[Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum]], saying that he "can't visit Russia at the moment", while confirming that he had spoken to Putin.[280] In December 2023, Lula said he would invite Vladimir Putin to the [[BRICS]] and [[2024 G20 Rio de Janeiro summit]] in Brazil.
Due to Brazil being a signatory of the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], Putin could be [[International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Russian figures]] by the Brazilian authorities if he sets foot on Brazil's territory.
Lula said Putin could be arrested in Brazil, but that would be the decision of Brazil's [[Judiciary of Brazil]], not his government.[281] In February 2024, he was visited by Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]].[282] In May 2025, he attended the [[2025 Moscow Victory Day Parade]] in Moscow.[283]
Lula has commented often on the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]].
He condemned the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]],[284] but Ukraine called some of his comments as "Russian attempts to distort the truth".[285][286]
In May 2022, Lula blamed both Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying that Zelenskyy "is as responsible as Putin for the war".[287] Lula also repeatedly criticized [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] for being partially responsible for the war.
U.S. [[National Security Council]] spokesman [[John Kirby (admiral)]] responded by accusing Lula of "parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda", describing his comments as "simply misguided" and "suggesting the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war".[289]
In April 2023, Lula initially condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory it has occupied since February 2022.[284] Later, however, that same month, he suggested that Ukraine should "give up [[Crimea]]" to Russia in exchange for [[Peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and Russia's withdrawal from Ukrainian territory [[Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine]] after February 2022, saying Zelenskyy "cannot want everything".[290][291]
After Germany appealed to Lula to [[List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War]] by selling it arms, Lula refused.[292] On 26 April, in a joint press conference, Spanish prime minister [[Pedro Sánchez]] questioned Lula's position, stressing that as the victimized country Ukraine needed to be supported.[293][better source needed] Lula said that he is seeking peace in accordance with a binding foreign policy principle in the pacifist [[Brazilian Constitution of 1988]].[294] He said that the countries of the [[Global North and Global South]], including Brazil, India, Indonesia and China "want peace", but both Putin and Zelenskyy "are convinced that they are going to win the war" and do not want to talk about peace.[295] He noted the [[Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War]], as well as the war's impact on [[2022–2023 food crises]], [[2021–2023 global energy crisis]], and [[Global supply chain]].[296][297]
In November 2023, Lula met in [[Riyadh]] with the prime minister and crown prince of Saudi Arabia, [[Mohammed bin Salman]].[298][299][300] They discussed strengthening bilateral relations, and investments in both countries.[299][300] Salman said that a more robust strategic partnership between the two countries would benefit both sides.[299] The $10 billion that the [[Sovereign wealth fund]] of Saudi Arabia pledged to invest in Brazil was one topic of conversation.[299][300]  Lula mentioned Brazil's rapprochement with Arab countries.[299] Salman also discussed Saudi Arabia's entry into BRICS in January 2024.[299]  Lula invited Salman to visit Brazil in 2024.[299][301][300]
In February 2024, Saudi Ambassador to Brazil Faisal Ghulam participated in a reception held by the ambassadors of [[Arab countries]] and [[Islamic countries]] in honour of Lula, and on behalf of the ambassadors of the Arab and Islamic countries, Ghulam delivered a speech in which he reviewed the developing relations between the Arab and Islamic countries and Brazil.[302]
Lula condemned the [[Gaza war]] carried out on 7 October 2023.[303] On 11 October 2023, he called for a ceasefire in the [[Gaza war]], stating, it was "urgently needed in defence of Israeli and Palestinian children".[304] Lula urged [[Hamas]] to release [[Gaza war hostage crisis]] Israeli children and Israel to stop bombing the [[Gaza Strip]] and allow Palestinian children and their mothers to leave the war zone.[305] On 25 October 2023, Lula stated, "It's not a war, it's a [[Palestinian genocide accusation]]".[306] On 18 February 2024, he drew comparisons to the [[The Holocaust]].[307] That same day, he was accused of "blatant antisemitism" by [[Dani Dayan]], the Chairman of [[Yad Vashem]], the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre, for comparing Israel's actions to Adolf Hitler.[308] Brazil's ambassador to Israel [[Frederico Meyer]] was recalled after these comments, and President Lula was designated a [[Persona non grata]] in the State of Israel.[309][310] Lula subsequently declined to apologise and despite having invoked a comparison with Adolf Hitler, he stated "I did not say the word Holocaust, that was the interpretation of the prime minister of Israel, it was not mine."[311]
In April 2023, alluding to the support of the United States for Ukraine in the wake of the  Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lula said that the US needs to "stop encouraging war."[312] In May 2023, he said that US economic sanctions on Venezuela were  "worse than a war" and "kill" women and children.[313] In February 2024, [[University of São Paulo]] foreign policy expert Feliciano de Sa Guimaraes said Lula only listens to one side in his government, "the left-wing, anti-American voices who very aggressively speak of a radical change in the global order."[314]
Lula restored diplomatic ties that Brazil had cut off with Venezuela's [[Nicolas Maduro]] government after 2018 elections that had been [[Venezuelan presidential crisis]].
In May 2023, Lula warmly embraced and fully supported Venezuela's authoritarian leftist President Nicolás Maduro.[317]  Lula dismissed charges against Maduro of [[Human rights]] and [[Civil rights]] abuses as a political "constructed narrative."[129]  Lula was criticized by Uruguay's President [[Luis Lacalle Pou]], who said that the "worst thing we can do" is pretend there are no significant human rights problems in Venezuela, and by Chile's President [[Gabriel Boric]], who said that Lula was making light of [[Human rights in Venezuela]].[317] Lula also criticized as "unjustified" [[Sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis]] for its alleged human rights abuses, and criticized the United States for denying the legitimacy of Maduro, who the U.S. said had not allowed free elections.[318][319][320]
In August 2024, amid [[2024 Venezuelan presidential election protests]] against Maduro, Lula described Maduro's government as "a very unpleasant regime" with an "authoritarian slant", but not a dictatorship.[321] Regarding Maduro's victory in the [[2024 Venezuelan presidential election]], which UN election experts said lacked "basic transparency and integrity", Lula said that Maduro should either hold new elections or form a [[Coalition government]].
The programme was created during the first term of Lula and then significantly cut by [[Jair Bolsonaro]], with its goal being help to around 60 million Brazilians suffering from poverty.[322] According to [[The World Bank]] estimates, the reinforced programme would reduce the poverty rate in Brazil to 24.3% – the level before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].[323][324]
The project also aims to boost economic growth and develop [[Clean energy]].[325][326]
In 2025, Lula became the first Brazilian president since 1992 to have one of his decrees overturned by [[Brazilian National Congress]] following its rejection of a proposal to raise a financial transactions tax.[330]
During his campaign, Lula pledged to end [[Illegal logging]].[331] In 2004, Lula had presented a road map for curbing [[Deforestation]].
Lula re-affirmed the plan's goals in his third term, with a new target of zero illegal deforestation by the year 2030.[333] The plan includes different measures for creating a sustainable economy in the Amazon region, like [[Bioeconomy]], rural credits and managed fishing.[334]
In the beginning of August Lula participated in the Belem summit,  8 Amazonian nations renewed [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization]].[338][needs update][339]
However, there are concerns that illegal loggers have partly moved their action from the Amazon rainforest to [[Cerrado]], where the environmental destruction has increased.[340]
In April, Biden pledged to give $500 million to the [[The Amazon Fund]] which was frozen during the rule of Bolsonaro and reactivated when Lula returned to power, to deal with [[Climate change]]".[343] According to [[John Kerry]], the overall financial help from US to Brazil for stopping deforestation through different channels will be around 2 billion US dollars.[344]
Lula and French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] agreed about cooperation between Brazil and France on different environmental issues, including the transmission of 1.1 billion dollars for preserving the Amazon rainforest.[345]
Lula pledged to recognize 14 new [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)]].
Several hours after Lula talked about leaving fossil fuels at the [[2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (also known as COP28), his government held an auction in which it offered 603 territorial blocks for oil extraction.
Lula has expressed support for the paving of [[BR-319 (Brazil highway)]], a project initiated by the Bolsonaro government.
Although he argues that the project can be done sustainably, one study found that the road could enable [[Deforestation]] on a scale of territory the size of [[Florida]] by 2030.
In November 2025, Lula took the unusual step for a head of state of personally attending the [[2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] conference in [[Belém]] in an attempt to smooth over geopolitical rifts preventing a climate deal from being reached.[350]
In March 2023, the Lula government launched a campaign to fight "misinformation".[351][352] The initiative was viewed by many as a tool for Lula's administration to delegitimize criticism it faces—under the guise of "fact-checking", and raised serious concerns about freedom of expression.[353][351] In response, the senior programme director of the [[International Center for Journalists]], Christina Tardáliga, tweeted "There is no such thing as government fact-checking.
In late October 2024, Lula suffered a fall in the official residence, which resulted in trauma to the back of his head and a small brain hemorrhage in the temporal-frontal region, prompting him to cancel, under advice from his doctors, a planned trip to a [[16th BRICS summit]].[354][355] In December of the same year, he was admitted to hospital after complaining of a headache.
A brain haemorrhage was discovered after an [[MRI scan]], and an emergency [[Craniotomy]] was performed.
The [[Intracranial haemorrhage]] was attributed to his fall in October.
After the operation he was reported to be recovering in [[Intensive care]].[356]
In May 2025, Lula was diagnosed with [[Labyrinthitis]] after suffering from vertigo.[357]
Lula has advocated "[[Socialism of the 21st century]]", but Lulism is considered to be substantially similar to [[Social liberalism]].[358][359][360] Although he showed a moderate centre-left liberal tendency economically, he highlighted his closeness with the [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]] and negatively evaluated [[Juan Guaidó]] during the [[Venezuelan crisis]].[361] He is "personally against" abortion, but maintains that it should be treated as a [[Unsafe abortion#Health risks]].[362][363]
Lula criticized the decisions by [[Western countries]] to cut funding to UNRWA and in response pledged to the [[State of Palestine]] that Brazil would increase its funding to UNRWA.
Lula has called for a [[Two-state solution]] with Palestine "definitively recognised as a full and sovereign state".[364]
On 18 February 2024, Lula told reporters in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]] while attending the African Union Summit, "What's happening in the [[Gaza Strip]] isn't a war, it's a [[Genocide]].
What's happening in the Gaza Strip with the [[Palestinian]] people hasn't happened at any other moment in history.
Actually, it has happened: when [[Adolf Hitler]] decided to kill the [[Jews]]".[364]
Academy Award-nominated Brazilian director [[Fábio Barreto]] directed the 2009 Brazilian biographical film [[Lula, Son of Brazil]] that depicts the life of Lula up to 35 years of age.[412]  Upon its release, it was the most expensive Brazilian film ever.[413] The film was a commercial and critical failure.[414][415] Critics charged that it was election propaganda, fostering a [[Cult of personality]].[416][417][418]
The Netflix Brazilian series [[The Mechanism (TV series)]] deals with Operation Car Wash, and has a character inspired by Lula, who is referred to as João Higino in the series.[419][420]
The 2019 Brazilian documentary, [[The Edge of Democracy]], written and directed by [[Petra Costa]], chronicled the rise and fall of Lula and Dilma Rousseff, and the socio-political upheaval in Brazil during the period.[421] Lula is also featured in the director's 2024 documentary [[Apocalypse in the Tropics]].[422]
