Namibia,[C] officially the Republic of Namibia,[D] is a country in [[Southern Africa]].[24]  Its borders include the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, [[Angola]] and [[Zambia]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east and [[South Africa]] to the south; in the northeast, approximating a [[Quadripoint]],[25] [[Zimbabwe]] lies less than 200 metres (660 feet) away along the [[Zambezi]] near [[Kazungula]], Zambia.
Namibia's capital and largest city is [[Windhoek]].
Namibia is the driest country in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],[26] and has been inhabited since prehistoric times by the [[Khoekhoe]], [[San people]], [[Damara people]] and [[Nama people]].
Around the 14th century, [[Immigration]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]].
From 1600 the [[Owambo people#History]] formed kingdoms, such as [[Ondonga]] and [[Oukwanyama]].[27]
In 1884, the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as [[German South West Africa]].
Between 1904 and 1908, German troops waged a punitive campaign against the [[Herero people]] and [[Nama people]] which escalated into the [[Herero and Nama genocide]] of the 20th century.
German rule ended during the [[First World War]] with a 1915 defeat by [[Union of South Africa]] forces.
In 1920, after the end of the war, the [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate]] administration of the colony to South Africa.
The [[National Party (South Africa)]], elected to power in 1948 in South Africa, applied [[Apartheid]] to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].
In the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation resulted in the [[United Nations]] assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained de facto rule until 1973.
That year the UN recognised the [[South West Africa People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people.
Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the [[South African Border War]].
However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.
Namibia is a stable [[Parliamentary democracy]].
Agriculture, [[Tourism in Namibia]] and the [[Mining in Namibia]] – including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining]], [[Gold mining]], [[Silver mining]] and [[Base metal]] – form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia]], while the manufacturing sector is comparatively small.
Despite significant [[Gross domestic product]] growth since its independence,[28] [[Poverty in Namibia]] and [[Wealth inequality]] remain significant in the country.
40.9% of the population is affected by [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]],[29] and more than 400,000 people continue to live in [[Informal housing]].[30] [[Income disparity]] in the country is one of the world's highest with a [[Gini coefficient]] of 59.1 in 2015.[31]
With a population of 3.1 million people, Namibia is one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density]] countries in the world.
Since the end of the [[Cold War]], it has attracted notable immigration from Germany, Angola, and Zimbabwe.[32] In 2021, German and Namibian diplomats created a "reconciliation agreement" acknowledging atrocities from the German colonial period.[33]
Namibia is a member state of the [[United Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]], the [[African Union]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].
The name of the country is derived from the [[Namib]] desert, the oldest desert in the world.[34] The word Namib itself is of [[Khoikhoi language]] origin and means "vast place".
The name was chosen by [[Mburumba Kerina]], who originally proposed "Republic of Namib".[35] Before Namibia became independent in 1990, its territory was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (Deutsch-Südwestafrika), and then as [[South West Africa]], reflecting its colonial occupation by Germans and South Africans, respectively.
The dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since prehistoric times by the [[San people]], [[Damara people]], and [[Nama people]].
For thousands of years, the [[Khoisan]] peoples of Southern Africa maintained a [[Nomad]] life, the [[Khoikhoi]] as pastoralists and the San people as [[Hunter-gatherer]].
Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.[36]
From the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.[37] Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful.
They received the missionaries accompanying the Oorlam very well,[38] granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment.[39] On their way further north, however, the Oorlam encountered clans of the [[OvaHerero people]] at Windhoek, [[Gobabis]], and [[Okahandja]], who resisted their encroachment.
The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.[40]
In 1878, the [[Cape Colony]], then a British colony, annexed the port of Walvis Bay and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910.
The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485[41] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area.
Like most of the interior of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century.
In 1870, [[Finland]] missionaries came to the northern part of Namibia to spread the [[Lutheranism]] among the [[Owambo people]] and [[Kavango people]].[42] In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]] crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic]] to Angola.
Namibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (Deutsch-Südwestafrika).[43] The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in [[Cape Town]] determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of Walvis Bay was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.
In 1897, a [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic]] caused massive cattle die-offs of an estimated 95% of cattle in southern and central Namibia.
In response the German colonisers set up a veterinary [[Cordon sanitaire (medicine)]] fence known as the [[Red Line (Namibia)]].[44] In 1907 this fence then broadly defined the boundaries for the first Police Zone.[45]
From 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people]] and the [[Nama people]] [[Herero Wars]] against ruthless German settlers.
In a calculated punitive action by the German settlers, [[Government of Namibia]] officials ordered the extinction of the natives in the OvaHerero and Nama genocide.
In what has been called the "first genocide of the 20th century",[46] the Germans systematically killed 10,000 Nama (half the population) and approximately 65,000 Herero (about 80% of the population).[47][48] The survivors, when finally released from detention, were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labour, racial segregation, and discrimination in a system that in many ways foreshadowed the [[Apartheid]] established by South Africa in 1948.
Most Africans were confined to so-called native territories, which under South African rule after 1949 were turned into "homelands" ([[Bantustans]]).
Some historians have speculated that the downfall of the Herero in Namibia was a model for the [[Nazism]] in [[The Holocaust]].[49] The memory of what happened under German rule has contributed to shape the ethnic identity in independent Namibia and has kept its significance in today's relations with Germany.[50]
However, the German government distanced itself from this apology.[51] Only in 2021 did the [[Government of Germany]] acknowledge the genocide and agree to pay €1.1 billion over 30 years in community aid.[52]
During World War I, South African troops under General [[Louis Botha]] [[South West Africa campaign]] and deposed the German colonial administration.
The end of the war and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] resulted in South West Africa remaining a possession of South Africa, at first as a [[League of Nations mandate]], until 1990.[53] The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated for an Allied annexation of former German and Ottoman territories and a proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.[53] It permitted the South African government to administer South West Africa until that territory's inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination.[54] South Africa interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare South West Africa for future autonomy.[54]
As a result of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in 1945, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system.
Article 77 of the [[United Nations Charter]] stated that UN trusteeship "shall apply...to territories now held under mandate"; furthermore, it would "be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms".[55] The UN requested all former League of Nations mandates be surrendered to its [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] in anticipation of their independence.[55] South Africa declined to do so and instead requested permission from the UN to formally annex South West Africa, for which it received considerable criticism.[55] When the UN General Assembly rejected this proposal, South Africa dismissed its opinion and began solidifying control of the territory.[55] The UN General Assembly and Security Council responded by referring the issue to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which held a number of discussions on the legality of South African rule between 1949 and 1966.[56]
South Africa began imposing [[Apartheid]], its codified system of racial segregation and discrimination, on South West Africa during the late 1940s.[57] Black South West Africans were subject to [[Pass laws]], curfews, and a host of residential regulations that restricted their movement.[57] Development was concentrated in the southern region of the territory adjacent to South Africa, known as the "Police Zone", where most of the major settlements and commercial economic activity were located.[58] Outside the Police Zone, indigenous peoples were restricted to theoretically self-governing [[Bantustan#Bantustans in South West Africa]].[58]
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accelerated [[Decolonisation of Africa]] and mounting pressure on the remaining colonial powers to grant their colonies self-determination resulted in the formation of nascent nationalist parties in South West Africa.[59] Movements such as the [[South West African National Union]] (SWANU) and the [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) advocated for the formal termination of South Africa's mandate and independence for the territory.[59] In 1966, following the ICJ's controversial ruling that it had no legal standing to consider the question of South African rule, SWAPO launched an armed insurgency that escalated into part of a wider regional conflict known as the [[South African Border War]].[60]
In 1971 Namibian contract workers led a [[1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike]] and in support of independence.[61] Some of the striking workers would later join SWAPO's [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]][62] as part of the South African Border War.
As SWAPO's insurgency intensified, South Africa's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline.[63] The UN declared that South Africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of South West Africa's indigenous inhabitants, and had thus disavowed its own mandate.[64] On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed Namibia.[64] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 269]], adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia illegal.[64][65] In recognition of this landmark decision, SWAPO's armed wing was renamed the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN).[66]
Namibia became one of several flashpoints for [[Cold War]] proxy conflicts in southern Africa during the latter years of the PLAN insurgency.[67] The insurgents sought out weapons and sent recruits to the Soviet Union for military training.[68] As the PLAN war effort gained momentum, the Soviet Union and other sympathetic states such as Cuba continued to increase their support, deploying advisers to train the insurgents directly as well as supplying more weapons and ammunition.[69] SWAPO's leadership, dependent on Soviet, Angolan, and Cuban military aid, positioned the movement firmly within the socialist bloc by 1975.[70] This practical alliance reinforced the external perception of SWAPO as a Soviet proxy, which dominated Cold War rhetoric in South Africa and the United States.[58] For its part, the Soviet Union supported SWAPO partly because it viewed South Africa as a regional Western ally.[71]
Growing war weariness and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers compelled South Africa, Angola, and Cuba to accede to the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)]], under pressure from both the Soviet Union and the United States.[72] South Africa accepted Namibian independence in exchange for Cuban military withdrawal from the region and an Angolan commitment to cease all aid to PLAN.[73] PLAN and South Africa adopted an informal ceasefire in August 1988, and a [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the Namibian peace process and supervise the return of refugees.[74] The ceasefire was broken after PLAN made a final incursion into the territory, possibly as a result of misunderstanding UNTAG's directives, in March 1989.[75] A new ceasefire was later imposed with the condition that the insurgents were to be confined to their external bases in Angola until they could be disarmed and demobilised by UNTAG.[74][76]
By the end of the 11-month transition period, the last South African troops had been withdrawn from Namibia, all political prisoners granted amnesty, racially discriminatory legislation repealed, and 42,000 Namibian refugees returned to their homes.[70] Just over 97% of eligible voters participated in the country's first [[Namibian parliamentary election, 1989]] held under a [[Universal franchise]].[77] The United Nations plan included oversight by [[Election monitoring]] in an effort to ensure a [[Election#Non-democratic elections]].
SWAPO won a plurality of seats in the [[Members of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia]] with 57% of the popular vote.[77] This gave the party 41 seats, but not a two-thirds majority, which would have enabled it to draft the constitution on its own.[77]
The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990.[78][42] [[Sam Nujoma]] was sworn in as the first [[President of Namibia]] at a ceremony attended by [[Nelson Mandela]] of South Africa (who had been released from prison the previous month) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state.[79] In 1994, shortly before the first multiracial elections in South Africa, that country ceded Walvis Bay to Namibia.[80]
[[Multiparty democracy]] was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and [[Elections in Namibia]] held regularly.
Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the [[SWAPO]] has won every election since independence.[81] The transition from the 15-year rule of President [[Sam Nujoma]] to his successor [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] in 2005 went smoothly.[82]
In 1998, [[Namibia Defence Force]] (NDF) troops were sent to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as part of a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) contingent.
In 1999, the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern [[Caprivi Strip]].[82] The [[Caprivi conflict]] was initiated by the [[Caprivi Liberation Army]] (CLA), a [[Rebellion]] group led by [[Mishake Muyongo]].
In 2007, [[Twyfelfontein]] was inscribed as a cultural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], a prehistoric site with one of the largest concentrations of rock engravings on the African continent.[84] In December 2014, Prime Minister [[Hage Geingob]], the candidate of ruling SWAPO, won the [[2014 Namibian general election]], taking 87% of the vote.
His predecessor, President [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]], also of SWAPO, had served the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution.[85] In December 2019, President Hage Geingob was [[2019 Namibian general election]] for a second term, taking 56.3% of the vote.[86] On 4 February 2024, President Hage Geingob died and he was immediately succeeded by vice-president [[Nangolo Mbumba]] as new President of Namibia who finished the late President's term as it came to an end in March 2025.[87] SWAPO's first female presidential candidate, [[Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah]], was declared the winner of the [[2024 Namibian general election]] with 57% of the vote.[88] On 21 March 2025, she  was sworn in as Namibia's new president.[89]
At 825,615 km2 (318,772 sq mi),[90] Namibia is the world's 34th largest country (after [[Venezuela]]).
It lies mostly between latitudes [[17th parallel south]] and [[29th parallel south]] (a small area is north of 17°), and longitudes [[11th meridian east]] and [[26th meridian east]].
The Namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas, each with characteristic [[Abiotic component]] and vegetation, with some variation within and overlap between them: the Central Plateau, the [[Namib]] Desert, the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa]], the [[Bushveld]], and the [[Kalahari Desert]].
Namibia is situated between the Namib and [[Kalahari Desert]].
Areas within the Namib include the Skeleton Coast and the [[Kaokoveld]] in the north and the extensive Namib Sand Sea along the central coast.[34]
The Central Plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the [[Skeleton Coast]] (a coastal desert) to the northwest, the Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the southwest, the [[Orange River]] to the south, and the Kalahari Desert to the east.
The Central Plateau is home to the highest point in Namibia at [[Königstein, Namibia]] elevation 2,573 m (8,440 ft; 1.60 mi).[92][93]
The [[Succulent Karoo]] is home to over 5,000 species of plants, nearly half of them [[Endemism]]; approximately 10 percent of the world's [[Succulents]] are found in the Karoo.[96][97] The reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation.[98]
Its sand dunes, created by the strong onshore winds, are the highest in the world.[99] Because of the location of the shoreline, at the point where the Atlantic's cold water reaches Africa's hot climate, often extremely dense fog forms along the coast.[100] Near the coast there are areas where the dune-hummocks are vegetated.[101] Namibia has rich coastal and marine resources that remain largely unexplored.[102] The [[Caprivi Strip]] extends east from the northeastern corner of the country.
Its overall climate description is arid, descending from the Sub-Humid [mean rain above 500 mm (20 in)] through Semi-Arid [between 300 and 500 mm (12 and 20 in)] (embracing most of the waterless Kalahari) and Arid [from 150 to 300 mm (5.9 to 12 in)] (these three regions are inland from the western [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa]]) to the Hyper-Arid coastal plain [less than 100 mm (3.9 in)].
Temperature maxima are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region: only in the far south, [[Warmbad, Namibia]] for instance, are maxima above 40 °C (104 °F) recorded.[106]
It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] cuts the country about in half.
Both rainy seasons occur in summer: the small rainy season between September and November, and the big one between February and April.[107] Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the [[Skeleton Coast]] (a coastal desert) to more than 600 mm (24 in) in the Caprivi Strip.
Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing [[Benguela Current]] of the Atlantic Ocean, which accounts for very low [[Precipitation (meteorology)]] (50 mm (2.0 in) per year or less), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country.[108] In Winter, occasionally a condition known as [[Bergwind]] (German for "mountain wind") or Oosweer ([[Afrikaans]] for "east weather") occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast.
The Central Plateau and Kalahari areas have wide [[Diurnal temperature variation]] temperature ranges of up to 30C (54F).[108]
Efundja, the annual seasonal flooding of the northern parts of the country, often causes not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life.[113] The rains that cause these floods originate in Angola, flow into Namibia's [[Cuvelai-Etosha Basin]], and fill the oshanas ([[Oshiwambo]]: flood plains) there.
Namibia is the driest country in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and depends largely on groundwater.
More than 100,000 [[Borehole]] have been drilled in Namibia over the past century.
One third of these boreholes have been drilled dry.[116] An [[Aquifer]] called Ohangwena II, on both sides of the Angola-Namibia border, was discovered in 2012.
Namibia is one of few countries in the world to specifically address [[Wildlife conservation]] and protection of [[Natural resources]] in its constitution.[121] Article 95 states, "The State shall actively promote and maintain the welfare of the people by adopting international policies aimed at the following: maintenance of [[Ecology]], essential ecological processes, and biological diversity of Namibia, and utilisation of living natural resources on a sustainable basis for the benefit of all Namibians, both present and future."[121]
In 1993, Namibia's newly formed government received funding from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) through its Living in a Finite Environment (LIFE) Project.[122] The [[Ministry of Environment and Tourism (Namibia)]], with financial support from organisations such as USAID, [[Endangered Wildlife Trust]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], and Canadian Ambassador's Fund, together form a Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) support structure.
Namibia has various species of wildlife including the [[African wild dog]], [[Dik-dik]] and critically endangered [[Black rhinoceros]].
Namibia is a [[Unitary state]] [[Semi-presidential system]] [[Representative democracy]] [[Republic]].[12] The [[President of Namibia]] is elected to a five-year term and is both the [[Head of state]] and the [[Head of government]].[126] All members of the government are individually and collectively responsible to the legislature.[127][128]
The [[Constitution of Namibia]] outlines the following as the organs of the country's government:[129]
While the constitution envisaged a [[Multi-party system]] for Namibia's government, the [[SWAPO]] party has been [[Dominant-party system]] since independence in 1990.[131] According to 2023 [[V-Dem Democracy indices]] Namibia is ranked 66th electoral democracy worldwide and 8th [[Democracy in Africa]].[132]
Namibia has a largely independent [[Foreign policy]], with persisting affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including [[Cuba]].
A member of the [[Southern African Development Community]], Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.
On its independence it became the 50th member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].
The 2019 budget for the [[Ministry of Defence (Namibia)]] was N$5,885 million (a 1.2% decrease from the previous financial year).[133] With close to 6 billion Namibian dollars (US$411 million in 2021) the Ministry of Defence receives the fourth highest amount of money from government per ministry.
Namibia does not have any enemies in [[Southern African Development Community]], though it has been involved in various disputes regarding borders and construction plans.[134]
The Namibian [[Constitution of Namibia]] defines the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the [[Namibian Defence Force]] (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) and [[South West Africa]] Territorial Force ([[SWATF]]).
The [[British government]] formulated the plan for integrating these forces and began training the NDF, which consists of a small headquarters and five battalions.
The [[United Nations Transitional Assistance Group]] (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to help train the NDF and to stabilise the north.
The chief of the Namibian Defence Force is Air Vice Marshal [[Martin Pinehas]] (with effect from 1 April 2020).
In 2017, Namibia signed the UN [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].[135]
The administrative division of Namibia is tabled by Delimitation Commissions and accepted or declined by the [[National Assembly of Namibia]].
Homosexual acts were formerly illegal in Namibia,[141] although the respective law was not enforced.[142] Discrimination, as well as intolerance, against [[LGBT rights in Namibia]] is widespread, specifically in rural areas.
Urban areas are generally neutral or supportive with a few LGBT-dedicated clubs and events.[143] Some Namibian government officials and high-profile figures, such as Namibia's [[Ombudsman]] John Walters and First Lady [[Monica Geingos]], had called for [[Sodomy]] and homosexuality to be decriminalised and are in favour of [[LGBT rights]].[141][144] In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages legally made outside of Namibia must be recognized by the government.[145] In 2024 the Windhoek High Court ruled the ban on homosexual acts between men to be unconstitutional.[146]
In November 2018, it was reported that 32% of women aged 15–49 experienced [[Violence against women]] and [[Domestic abuse]] from their spouses/partners and 29.5% of men believe that physical abuse towards their wife/partner is acceptable, although this is typically in rural areas.[147] The Namibian constitution guarantees the rights, freedoms and equal treatment of women in Namibia[148] and SWAPO, the ruling party in Namibia, has adopted a "zebra system", which ensures a fair balance of both genders in government and equal representation of women in the Namibian government.[149][140]
The trans-African automobile route – the [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]] and the [[Trans-Kalahari Corridor]] pass through Namibia.
Namibia's economy is tied closely to [[Economy of South Africa]]'s due to their shared history.[150][151] In Q3 2023, the largest economic sectors were mining (18.0% of GDP), public administration (12.9%), manufacturing (10.1%), and education (9.2%).[152]
The [[Bank of Namibia]] (BoN) is the central bank of Namibia responsible for performing all other functions ordinarily performed by a central bank.
[[Poverty in Namibia]] and inequality remain significant in the country.
40.9% of the population is affected by [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] while an additional 19.2 percent is classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.[29] [[Income disparity]] in the country remains one of the world's highest with a [[Gini coefficient]] of 59.1 in 2015.[31]
In early 2010 the Government [[Tender board]] announced that "henceforth 100 per cent of all unskilled and semi-skilled labour must be sourced, without exception, from within Namibia".[157]
In 2013, global business and financial news provider [[Bloomberg L.P.]] named Namibia the top emerging market economy in Africa and the 13th best in the world.
Only four African countries made the Top 20 Emerging Markets list in the March 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine, and Namibia was rated ahead of [[Morocco]] (19th), South Africa (15th), and Zambia (14th).
Facilitation payments are occasionally demanded by customs due to cumbersome and costly customs procedures.[158] Namibia is also classified as an Upper Middle Income country by the [[World Bank]], and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business.[159]
The [[Cost of living in Namibia]] is slightly above average because most goods, including cereals, need to be imported.
[[Taxation in Namibia]] includes personal income tax, which is applicable to the total taxable income of an individual.
Despite the remote nature of much of the country, Namibia has seaports, airports, highways, well-maintained roads, infrastructure and [[Rail transport in Namibia]] (narrow-gauge).
The Central Plateau already serves as a [[Transportation corridor]] from the more densely populated north to South Africa, the source of four-fifths of Namibia's imports.[164]
About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely [[Subsistence agriculture]]) for its livelihood, but Namibia must still import some of its food.
Namibia has one of the [[List of countries by income equality]] in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy.
About 4,000 commercial farmers own almost half of Namibia's arable land.[165] The United Kingdom offered about $180,000 in 2004 to help finance Namibia's [[Land reform]] process, as Namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black Namibians.[166] Germany has offered €1.1bn in 2021 over 30 years in reparations for the genocides in the early 20th century but the money will go towards infrastructure, healthcare and training programmes not land reform.[167]
An agreement has been reached on the [[Privatisation]] of several more enterprises in coming years, with hopes that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment, but reinvestment of environmentally derived capital has hobbled Namibian per capita income.[168] One of the fastest growing areas of economic development in Namibia is the growth of [[Communal Wildlife Conservancies in Namibia]].
Providing 25% of Namibia's revenue, mining is the single most important contributor to the economy.[169] Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa and was the world's fourth largest producer of [[Uranium]].
There have been significant investment in [[Uranium mining]] and Namibia planned to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015.[170] However, as of 2019 Namibia continued to produce 750 tons of uranium annually making it a smaller than average exporter in the competitive world market.[171] Rich [[Alluvium]] diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds.[172] While Namibia is known predominantly for its gem diamond and uranium deposits, a number of other minerals are extracted industrially such as [[Lead]], [[Tungsten]], [[Gold]], [[Tin]], [[Fluorspar]], [[Manganese]], [[Marble]], [[Copper]] and [[Zinc]].
Country's gold production in 2015 is 6 metric tons.[173] There are offshore gas deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future.[174] According to "The Diamond Investigation", a book about the global diamond market, from 1978, [[De Beers]], the largest diamond company, bought most of the Namibian diamonds, and would continue to do so, because "whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive".[175]
Although much of the world's diamond supply comes from what have been called African [[Blood diamonds]], Namibia has managed to develop a diamond mining industry largely free of the kinds of conflict, extortion, and murder that have plagued many other African nations with diamond mines.
This has been attributed to political dynamics, economic institutions, grievances, political geography, and the effects of neighbourhoods, and is the result of a joint agreement between the government and [[De Beers]] that has led to a taxable base, strengthening state institutions.[176]
Tourism is a major contributor (14.5%) to Namibia's GDP, creating tens of thousands of jobs (18.2% of all employment) directly or indirectly and servicing over a million tourists per year.[179] The country is a prime destination in Africa and is known for [[Ecotourism]], which features [[Wildlife of Namibia]].[180]
Sport and [[Trophy hunting]] is also a large and growing component of the Namibian economy, accounting for 14% of total tourism in the year 2000, or 19.6 million U.S. dollars, with Namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters.[181]
In addition, extreme sports such as [[Sandboarding]], [[Skydiving]] and 4x4ing have become popular, and many cities have companies that provide tours.[citation needed] The most visited places include the capital city of [[Windhoek]], [[Caprivi Strip]], [[Fish River Canyon]], [[Sossusvlei]], the [[Skeleton Coast]] Park, [[Sesriem]], [[Etosha Pan]] and the coastal towns of [[Swakopmund]], [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Lüderitz]].[182]
Windhoek plays a very important role in Namibia's tourism due to its central location and close proximity to [[Hosea Kutako International Airport]].
According to The Namibia Tourism Exit Survey, which was produced by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism, 56% of all tourists visiting Namibia in 2012–13 visited Windhoek.[183] Many of Namibia's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts and the [[Namibia Tourism Board]] as well as Namibia's tourism-related [[Trade association]] such as the [[Hospitality Association of Namibia]] are headquartered in Windhoek.[184] There are also a number of notable hotels in Windhoek, such as [[Windhoek Country Club Resort]], and some international hotel chains, such as [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]].
Namibia's primary tourism related governing body, the [[Namibia Tourism Board]] (NTB), was established by an Act of Parliament: the Namibia Tourism Board Act, 2000 (Act 21 of 2000).
Its primary objectives are to regulate the tourism industry and to market Namibia as a tourist destination.[185] There are also a number of [[Trade association]] that represent the tourism sector in Namibia, such as the Federation of Namibia Tourism Associations (the umbrella body for all tourism associations in Namibia), the [[Hospitality Association of Namibia]], the Association of Namibian Travel Agents, Car Rental Association of Namibia and the Tour and Safari Association of Namibia.[186]
The only bulk water supplier in Namibia is [[NamWater]], which sells it to the respective municipalities which in turn deliver it through their reticulation networks.[187] In rural areas, the directorate of Rural Water Supply in the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Namibia)]] is in charge of drinking water supply.[187]
The [[United Nations]] evaluated in 2011 that Namibia has improved its water access network significantly since independence in 1990.
Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in [[Township]] due to their water consumption and installation cost.
As a result, access to [[Improved sanitation]] has not increased much since independence: in Namibia's rural areas 13% of the population had more than basic sanitation, up from 8% in 1990.
Many of Namibia's inhabitants have to resort to "flying toilets", plastic bags to defecate into, which after use are flung into the bush.[191] The use of open areas close to residential land for urination and defecation is very common[192] and has been identified as a major [[Health in Namibia]].[190]
Namibia has the second-[[List of countries by population density]] of any sovereign country, after [[Mongolia]], as well as having the lowest population density of any sovereign country with a coastline.[193] In 2017 there were on average 3.08 people per km2.[194] The [[Total fertility rate]] in 2015 was 3.47 children per woman according to the UN which is lower than the average TFR in sub-Saharan Africa of 4.7.[195]
Between 2001 and 2011 the annual population growth was 1.4%, down from 2.6% in the previous ten-year period.[199] In 2023, the [[Namibia Statistics Agency]] conducted another census, which counted 3,022,401 inhabitants.[200]
Namibia has many ethnic groups.[10] The majority of the Namibian population is made of [[Bantu peoples]]  and [[Khoisan]] peoples.
The Bantu groups include the  [[Owambo people]], [[Herero people]], [[Kavango people]], [[Lozi people]], [[Tswana people]] and [[Himba people]] peoples.
The Khoisan groups encompass the [[Damara people]], [[Nama people]], and [[San people]] peoples.
There is also a mixed ancestry population consisting of [[Coloured people in Namibia]] (2.1%) and [[Basters]] (1.5%).[10] There is a substantial [[Chinese people in Namibia]]; it stood at 40,000 in 2006.[201]
[[White Namibians]] (being mainly of [[Afrikaner people]], German, British and [[Portuguese diaspora]] origin) make up 1.8% of the population.
Although their proportion of the population decreased after [[Independence of Namibia]] due to emigration and lower birth rates, they still form the second-largest population of [[Ethnic groups in Europe]], both in terms of percentage and actual numbers, in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (after South Africa).[10] The majority of [[White Namibians]] and nearly all those who are of [[Basters]] speak [[Afrikaans]] and share similar origins, culture, and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa.
A large minority of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins back to the [[German Namibians]] settlers who colonised Namibia prior to the South African invasion during the First World War, and they maintain German cultural and educational institutions.
Nearly all Portuguese settlers came to the country from the former [[Portuguese West Africa]] of Angola.[202] The 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then South West Africa, including 73,464 whites (14%).[203]
Curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in Okahandja.[204] Among sub-Saharan African countries, Namibia has one of the highest literacy rates.[205] According to [[CIA World Factbook]], as of 2018 91.5% of the population age 15 and over can read and write.[205]
There are four teacher training universities, three colleges of agriculture, a police training college, and three universities: [[University of Namibia]] (UNAM), [[International University of Management]] (IUM) and [[Namibia University of Science and Technology]] (NUST).
Namibia was ranked 91st in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2025.[206][207]
The Christian community makes up 80%–90% of the population of Namibia, with at least 75% being [[Protestant]], of which at least 50% are [[Lutheranism]].
Lutherans are the largest religious group, a legacy of the German and [[Finland]] missionary work during the country's colonial times.[42] 10%–20% of the population hold [[Indigenous peoples]] beliefs.[208]
Today most Christians are [[Lutheran]], but there also are [[Roman Catholic]], [[Methodism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], and [[Dutch Reformed Church]].
[[Islam in Namibia]] is subscribed to by about 9,000 people,[209] many of them Nama.[210] Namibia is home to a small [[Judaism]] [[History of the Jews in Namibia]] of about 100 people.[211]
Groups such as the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are also present in the country.
Up to 1990, English, [[German language in Namibia]], and [[Afrikaans]] were official languages.
Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted [[Languages of South Africa]] official status), which it saw as "a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation."[212] Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as Namibia's sole official language, though only 2.3% of the population speaks it as a home language.
[[Ovambo language]] remains the predominant language, claiming the position of the most spoken language for a significant 49.7% of households, surpassing its previous standing.
[[KhoeKhoegowab]] follows at 11.0%, while the [[Kavango – Southwest Bantu languages]] Languages, with a share of 10.4%, have also experienced a noteworthy increase.
[[Lozi language]] has seen a shift to 4.9%, and English, utilized primarily as a second language, stands at 2.3%.
The diversity of languages in the region is further demonstrated by the presence of Other African Languages at 0.5%, [[Tswana language]] at 0.3%, and Other European Languages at 0.1%.[215]
As a home language, Afrikaans is spoken by 60% of the white community, German by 32%, English by 7% and Portuguese by 4–5%.[208] Geographical proximity to Portuguese-speaking Angola explains the relatively high number of [[Portuguese speaker]]; in 2011 these were estimated to number 100,000.[216]
[[Life expectancy]] at birth is estimated to be 64 years in 2017 – among the lowest in the world.[217]
The [[AIDS in Namibia]] remains a public health issue in Namibia despite significant achievements made by the [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Namibia)]] to expand HIV treatment services.[221] In 2001, there were an estimated 210,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, and the estimated death toll in 2003 was 16,000.
As of 2015, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and UNAIDS produced a Progress Report Archived 19 January 2022 at the [[Wayback Machine]] in which [[UNAIDS]] projected HIV prevalence among 15–49-year-olds at 13.3% [12.2–14.5%] and an estimated 210,000 [200,000–230,000] living with HIV.[224]
The [[Malaria]] problem seems to be compounded by the AIDS epidemic.
The most popular sport in Namibia is [[Association football]].
The [[Namibia national football team]] qualified for the [[1998 Africa Cup of Nations]], [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]], and [[2023 Africa Cup of Nations]] editions of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], but has yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]].
Some notable players include [[Derby County F.C.]] right-back [[Ryan Nyambe]], [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.]] forward [[Peter Shalulile]], and retired footballer [[Collin Benjamin]].
The most successful national team is the [[Namibia national rugby union team]], having competed in the last seven World Cups.
Namibia were participants in the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], [[2015 Rugby World Cup]], [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], and most recent [[2023 Rugby World Cup]] [[Rugby World Cup]].
[[Jacques Burger]] is an internationally successful Namibian rugby player.
[[Cricket in Namibia]] is also popular, with [[Namibia national cricket team]] having qualified for [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], [[2021 ICC T20 World Cup]] and [[2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup]].[229] In December 2017, Namibia Cricket reached the final of the Cricket South Africa (CSA) Provincial One Day Challenge for the first time.[230] In February 2018, Namibia hosted the ICC World Cricket League Division 2 with Namibia, Kenya, UAE, Nepal, Canada and Oman to compete for the final two ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier positions in Zimbabwe.
[[Frankie Fredericks]], sprinter in the 100 and 200 m [[Track and field]] events, has won four Olympic silver medals (1992, 1996) and has medals from several [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]].[231] Golfer [[Trevor Dodds]] won the [[Greater Greensboro Open]] in 1998, one of 15 tournaments in his career.
He achieved a career-high world ranking of 78th in 1998.[citation needed] Professional cyclist and Namibian Road Race champion [[Dan Craven]] represented Namibia at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in both the road race and individual time trial.[232] Boxer [[Julius Indongo]] was a unified WBA, IBF, and IBO world champion in the [[Light welterweight]] division.
Over the past years, the country usually ranked in the upper quarter of the [[Press Freedom Index]] of [[Reporters without Borders]], reaching position 21 in 2010, being on par with Canada and the best-positioned African country.[233] The African Media Barometer shows similarly positive results.
Namibia has a state-owned press agency, called [[Namibia Press Agency]].[234] Overall c.
Current daily newspapers are the private publications [[The Namibian]] (English and other languages), [[Die Republikein]] (Afrikaans), [[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)]] (German) and [[Namibian Sun]] (English) as well as the state-owned [[New Era (Namibia)]] (predominantly English).
Except for the largest newspaper, The Namibian, which is owned by a trust, the other mentioned private newspapers are part of Democratic Media Holdings.[234] Other mentionable newspapers are the tabloid Informanté owned by TrustCo, the weekly [[Windhoek Observer]], the weekly [[Namibia Economist]], as well as the regional Namib Times.
Current affairs magazines include [[Insight Namibia]], Vision2030 Focus magazine[citation needed] and Prime FOCUS.
The [[Sister Namibia]] magazine stands out as the longest running NGO magazine in Namibia, while [[Namibia Sport]] is the only national sport magazine.
The broadcasting sector today is dominated by the state-run [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NBC).
The [[Public broadcasting]] offers a TV station as well as a "National Radio" in English and nine language services in locally spoken languages.
Privately held [[One Africa Television]] has competed with NBC since the 2000s.[234][242]
Media and journalists in Namibia are represented by the Namibian chapter of the [[Media Institute of Southern Africa]] and the Editors' Forum of Namibia.
The [[National Art Gallery of Namibia]] houses a permanent exhibition of Namibian, African and European Art and shows temporary exhibitions of local artists.
