Profiles in Courage is a 1956 volume of short biographies describing acts of bravery and integrity by eight [[United States Senate]].
Kennedy]] with [[Ted Sorensen]] as a [[Ghostwriter]],  profiles senators who defied the opinions of their party and constituents to do what they felt was right and suffered severe criticism and losses in popularity as a result.
It begins with a quotation from [[Edmund Burke]] on the courage of the English statesman [[Charles James Fox]], in his 1783 "attack upon the tyranny of the [[East India Company]]" in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]], and focuses on mid-19th-century antebellum America and the efforts of senators to delay the [[American Civil War]].[2] Profiles in Courage was widely celebrated and became a bestseller.
It includes a foreword by [[Allan Nevins]].
Kennedy, then a U.S. senator, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]] for the work.
However, in his 2008 autobiography, Kennedy's speechwriter Ted Sorensen, who was presumed as early as 1957 to be the book's ghostwriter, acknowledged that he "did a first draft of most chapters" and "helped choose the words of many of its sentences".[3][4][5] [[Jules Davids]], who was a history professor for Kennedy's wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] when she was a student at George Washington University, is also acknowledged to have made key contributions to the historical research and organizational planning for the book.[6][7]
In 1990, Kennedy's family created the [[Profile in Courage Award]] to honor individuals who have acted with courage in the same vein as those profiled in the book.
The book also served as the basis for an American historical anthology series of the [[Profiles in Courage (TV series)]] that was telecast weekly on NBC from November 8, 1964, to May 9, 1965.
In 1952 and 1958, he was elected a senator from Massachusetts and served in the Senate until resigning after he was elected president in [[1960 United States presidential election]].
It was a passage from [[Herbert Agar]]'s 1950 book The Price of Union about an act of courage by an earlier senator from Massachusetts, [[John Quincy Adams]], that gave Kennedy the idea of writing about senatorial courage.
He showed the passage to [[Ted Sorensen]] and asked him to see if he could find some more examples.
This Sorensen did, and eventually they had enough not just for an article, as Kennedy had originally envisaged, but a book.[8] With help from research assistants and the [[Library of Congress]], Sorenson wrote a first draft of the book while Kennedy was bedridden with [[Addison's disease]] and recovering from back surgery during 1954 and 1955.[9]
Historian [[Timothy Naftali]] remarked that another motivation for Kennedy to write the book was his desire to improve his reputation after failing to vote to censure Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].
The book won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]] in 1957, even though it was not one of the finalists forwarded to the prize board from the selection committee.
Kennedy Sr.]] asked columnist [[Arthur Krock]], his political adviser and a longtime member of the prize board, to persuade others to vote for it.[11][12]
Profiles in Courage was the basis of a [[Profiles in Courage (TV series)]] name that aired on the [[NBC]] network during the 1964–1965 [[Television season]].
In 1956, Kennedy gave a copy of the book to [[Richard Nixon]], who responded that he was looking forward to reading it.
After being defeated by Kennedy in the [[1960 United States presidential election]], Nixon was advised by [[Mamie Eisenhower]] to write a book himself.
Nixon wrote his book [[Six Crises]] (1962) in response to Profiles in Courage.[14][15][16]
In response to criticism that the book included only men, in 1958 Kennedy published an article in the women's magazine [[McCall's]] that honored "Three Women of Courage," by adding [[Jeannette Rankin]], [[Anne Hutchinson]], and [[Prudence Crandall]] to his Hall of Fame.[17][18]
On December 7, 1957,[19] journalist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)]] appeared as a guest on [[The Mike Wallace Interview]] and made the claim that "John F.
by someone else?" Pearson responded that he did and that Kennedy speechwriter [[Ted Sorensen]] wrote the book.
Kennedy]] saw the broadcast, then called his lawyer, [[Clark Clifford]], yelling: "Sue the bastards for fifty million dollars!" Soon Clifford and [[Robert F.
According to [[The Straight Dope]], Herbert Parmet later analyzed the text of Profiles in Courage and wrote in his book Jack: The Struggles of John F.
In addition to Kennedy's speechwriter Sorensen, [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] recruited her history instructor from [[Georgetown University]], [[Jules Davids]], to work on the project.
Kennedy's handwritten notes, which Kennedy showed to reporters to prove his authorship, are now in the [[Kennedy Library]], but are mostly preliminary notes about John Quincy Adams, a particular interest of Kennedy's, and are not a readable draft of the chapter on Adams.
Kennedy's preserved notes show that he kept up with the book's progress, but historian [[Garry Wills]] remarked that Kennedy's notes contain no draft of any stage of the manuscript, or of any substantial part of it.[21]
According to Fehrman, "Even the book's idea came from him (Sorensen)": after Kennedy suggested that Sorensen write a magazine article on Adams's courage as senator for publication with Kennedy's name, Sorensen suggested to Kennedy in a letter accompanying the draft article that he ask [[Harper & Brothers]]—where [[Michael Temple Canfield]], Jacqueline Kennedy's brother-in-law, worked—if the publisher were interested in a book on the topic.
Although friends and family said that the Pulitzer made Kennedy happier than his World War II [[Purple Heart]] or any other award, and Kennedy told [[Margaret Coit]] in 1953 "I would rather win a Pulitzer Prize than be president", the award caused the press to investigate Profiles's authorship.
In May 1957, two weeks after the award, [[Gilbert Seldes]] discussed the rumor that Kennedy had not written the book in [[The Village Voice]].
Stewart]] has questioned the accuracy of the book's chapter on the [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson]].
Kennedy also praised Lucius Lamar, who, while working in the public eye towards reconciliation, privately was an instigator, according to the claim of author [[Nicholas Lemann]], of growing racial agitation.[26] In the profile of Lamar, Kennedy had also included a single paragraph condemning [[Adelbert Ames]], the Maine-born [[Governor of Mississippi]] from 1873 to 1876, as an opportunistic [[Carpetbagger]] whose administration was "sustained and nourished by Federal bayonets".
Ames's daughter, [[Blanche Ames Ames]], was outraged, and regularly wrote to Kennedy for years afterward in protest, demanding a retraction of the "defamatory insinuations" and accused him of pandering to Southern readers.[27] The letter-writing continued even after Kennedy had been elected to the presidency.
This prompted Kennedy to turn to [[George Plimpton]], Ames's grandson and a classmate of [[Robert F.
