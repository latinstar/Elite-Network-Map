Albanian ([[Endonym and exonym]]: shqip [ʃcip] ⓘ, gjuha shqipe [ˈɟuha ˈʃcipɛ] ⓘ, or arbërisht [aɾbəˈɾiʃt]) is an [[Indo-European languages]] language and the only surviving representative of the [[Albanoid]], which belongs to the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]].[9] It is the native language of the [[Albanian people]].
Standard Albanian is the [[Official language]] of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], and a co-official language in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], where it is the primary language of significant Albanian minority communities.
Albanian is recognized as a [[Minority language]] in [[Italy]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]].
It is also spoken by long-established communities in [[Greece]], and by the [[Albanian diaspora]], which is generally concentrated in the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Oceania]].[2][10] Albanian is estimated to have as many as 7.5 million native speakers.[1][2]
Albanian and other [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] had their formative core in the [[Balkans]] after the [[Indo-European migrations]] in the region.[11][12] Albanian in antiquity is often thought to have been an [[Illyrian language]] for obvious geographic and historical reasons,[13][14][15][16][17][18] or otherwise an unmentioned Balkan Indo-European language that was closely related to Illyrian and [[Messapic language]].[19][20][21][22] The Indo-European subfamily that gave rise to Albanian is called [[Albanoid]] in reference to a specific ethnolinguistically pertinent and historically compact language group.[23] Whether descendants or sisters of what was called 'Illyrian' by classical sources, Albanian and Messapic, on the basis of shared features and innovations, are grouped together in a common branch in the current phylogenetic classification of the Indo-European language family.[24][19][23][21][22]
The first written mention of Albanian was in 1284 in a witness testimony from the [[Republic of Ragusa]], while a letter written by Dominican Friar Gulielmus Adea in 1332 mentions the Albanians using the Latin alphabet in their writings.
The oldest surviving attestation of modern Albanian is from 1462.[25] The two main [[Albanian dialects]] (or [[Variety (linguistics)]]), [[Gheg Albanian]] and [[Tosk Albanian]], are primarily distinguished by [[Phonology]] differences and are [[Mutual intelligibility]] in their standard varieties,[26][27] with Gheg spoken to the north and Tosk spoken to the south of the [[Shkumbin]].[28] Their characteristics[29][30] in the treatment of both native words and loanwords provide evidence that the split into the northern and the southern dialects occurred after [[Christianisation]] of the region (4th century AD),[31][32] and most likely not later than the 6th century AD,[33][34][35] hence possibly occupying roughly their present area divided by the Shkumbin river since the Post-Roman and Pre-Slavic period, straddling the [[Jireček Line]].[36][37]
Centuries-old communities speaking Albanian dialects can be found scattered in [[Greece]] (the [[Arvanites]] and some communities in [[Epirus (region)]], [[Western Macedonia]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]]),[38] [[Croatia]] (the [[Arbanasi people]]), [[Italy]] (the [[Arbëreshë people]])[39] as well as in [[Albanians of Romania]], [[Albanians of Turkey]] and [[Albanians in Ukraine]].[40] The [[Gheg Albanian#Malsia Albanian]][41][42] and two varieties of the Tosk dialect, [[Arvanitika]] in Greece and [[Arbëresh language]] in southern Italy, have preserved archaic elements of the language.[43] [[Ethnic Albanians]] constitute a large [[Diaspora]], with many having long assimilated in different cultures and communities.
[[Standard Albanian]] is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based mainly on [[Tosk Albanian]].
The language is spoken by approximately 6 million people in the Balkans, primarily in Albania, [[Kosovo]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Greece]].[1] However, due to old communities in [[Italy]] (originating from Skanderbeg's times) and the large [[Albanian diaspora]], the worldwide total of speakers is much higher than in [[Southern Europe]] and numbers approximately 7.5 million.[1][2]
The Albanian language is the official language of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] and a co-official language in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]].[47][48] Albanian is a recognised minority language in [[Croatia]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and in [[Serbia]].
Albanian is also spoken by a [[Albanian communities in Greece]], specifically in the [[Thesprotia]] and [[Preveza (regional unit)]] regional units and in a few villages in [[Ioannina (regional unit)]] and [[Florina (regional unit)]] regional units in Greece.[38] It is also spoken by 450,000 Albanian immigrants in Greece, making it one of the commonly spoken languages in the country after Greek.
Albanian is the third most common [[Mother tongue]] among foreign residents in [[Italy]].[49] This is due to a substantial Albanian immigration to Italy.
Italy has a historical Albanian minority of about 500,000, scattered across southern Italy, known as [[Arbëreshë people]].
Approximately 1 million Albanians from Kosovo are dispersed throughout [[Albanians in Germany]], [[Albanians in Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].
In [[Albanians in Switzerland]], the Albanian language is the [[Languages of Switzerland#Other languages]] with 176,293 native speakers.
There are large numbers of Albanian speakers in the United States, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and [[Albanian Canadians]].
The Arbëreshë have a strong sense of identity and are unique in that they speak an archaic dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] called [[Arbëresh language]].
In the United States and Canada, there are approximately 250,000 [[Albanian Americans]] speakers.
In Argentina, there are nearly [[Argentina#Languages]], mostly in Buenos Aires.[51][need quotation to verify]
Approximately 1.3 million people of Albanian ancestry live in [[Turkey]], with more than 500,000 recognizing their ancestry, language, and [[Culture of Albania]].
However, the vast majority of this population is [[Language shift]] and no longer possesses fluency in the Albanian language, though a vibrant Albanian community maintains its distinct identity in [[Istanbul]] to this day.
[[Egypt]] also lays claim to about 18,000 Albanians, mostly [[Tosk]] speakers.[52] Many are descendants of the [[Janissary]] of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], an Albanian who became [[Wāli]], and self-declared [[Khedive]] of Egypt and [[Sudan]].
In addition to the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]] that he established, a large part of the former Egyptian and Sudanese [[Aristocracy]] was of Albanian origin.
Albanian is also spoken by Albanian diaspora communities residing in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].
Does not include [[Arbëresh language]].
The Albanian language has two distinct dialects, [[Tosk Albanian]] which is spoken in the south, and [[Gheg Albanian]] spoken in the north.[74] Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk dialect.
The [[Shkumbin River]] is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.[75]
[[Gheg Albanian]] is divided into four sub-dialects: Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg and Southern Gheg.
It is primarily spoken in northern Albania, [[Kosovo]], and throughout [[Albanians in Montenegro]] and northwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia]].
One fairly divergent dialect is the [[Upper Reka Albanian dialect]], which is however classified as Central Gheg.
There is also a diaspora dialect in [[Croatia]], the [[Arbanasi dialect]].
[[Tosk Albanian]] is divided into five sub-dialects, including Northern Tosk (the most numerous in speakers), [[Labërisht]], [[Cham Albanian dialect]], [[Arvanitika]], and [[Arbëresh language]].
Cham Albanian is spoken in North-western Greece,[76] while [[Arvanitika language]] is spoken by the [[Arvanites]] in southern Greece.
In addition, [[Arbëresh language]] is spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people]] people, descendants of 15th and 16th century migrants who settled in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]].[77][78] These settlements originated from the (Arvanites) communities probably of Peloponnese known as Morea in the Middle Ages.
Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written in the [[Latin script]].
Both dialects had also been written in the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] version of the [[Arabic script]], [[Cyrillic script]], and some local alphabets ([[Elbasan alphabet]], [[Vithkuqi alphabet]], [[Todhri alphabet]], Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see [[Albanian alphabet#Original alphabets]]).
These attempts intensified after the [[League of Prizren]] and culminated with the [[Congress of Manastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardised spelling would be for standard Albanian.
The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters ⟨[[Ë]]⟩, ⟨[[Ç]]⟩, and nine [[Digraph (orthography)]]: dh, gj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh and zh.
According to [[Robert Elsie]]:[80]
Albanian constitutes one of the eleven major branches of the [[Indo-European language family]],[82] within which it occupies an independent position.[83] In 1854, Albanian was demonstrated to be an [[Indo-European languages]] by the [[Comparative linguistics]] [[Franz Bopp]].
Albanian was formerly compared by a few Indo-European linguists with [[Germanic languages]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages]], all of which share a number of [[Isogloss]] with Albanian.[84] Other linguists linked the Albanian language with [[Latin Language]], [[Greek language]] and [[Armenian language]], while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-European.[85][86][87] In current scholarship there is evidence that Albanian is closely related to Greek and Armenian, while the fact that it is a [[Satem language]] language is less significant.[82]
[[Armenian language]]
[[Greek language]]
[[Phrygian language]](extinct)
[[Messapic language]](extinct)
[[Gheg Albanian]]
[[Tosk Albanian]]
[[Messapic language]] is considered the closest language to Albanian,[24][23][19] grouped in a common branch titled Illyric in Hyllested & Joseph (2022).[24] Hyllested & Joseph (2022) in agreement with recent bibliography identify Greco-Phrygian as the IE branch closest to the Albanian-Messapic one.
The hypothesis of the "[[Paleo-Balkan languages]]" continuum posits a common period of prehistoric coexistence of several Indo-European dialects in the [[Balkans]] prior to 2000 BC.
To this group would belong Albanian, [[Ancient Greek]], [[Armenian language]], [[Phrygian language]], fragmentary attested languages such as [[Ancient Macedonian language]], [[Thracian language]], or [[Illyrian language]], and the relatively well-attested [[Messapic language]] in Southern Italy.
The concept of this linguistic group is explained as a kind of language league of the [[Bronze Age]] (a specific [[Sprachbund]] phenomenon), although it also consisted of languages that were related to each other.[88] A common prestage posterior to [[Proto-Indo-European language]] comprising Albanian, Greek, and Armenian, is considered as a possible scenario.
Albanian represents one of the core languages of the [[Balkan sprachbund]].[82]
The first attested written mention of the Albanian language was on 14 July 1284 in [[Republic of Ragusa]] in modern [[Croatia]] ([[Dubrovnik]]) when a crime witness named Matthew testified: "I heard a voice crying on the mountain in the Albanian language" ([[Latin language]]: Audivi unam vocem, clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca).[92][93]
The Albanian language is also mentioned in the [[Descriptio Europae Orientalis]][94] dated in 1308:
The oldest attested document written in Albanian dates to 1462,[95] while the first audio recording in the language was made by [[Norbert Jokl]] on 4 April 1914 in [[Vienna]].[96]
By the [[Late Middle Ages]], during the period of [[Humanism]] and the [[European Renaissance]], the term lingua epirotica 'Epirotan language' was preferred in the intellectual, literary, and clerical circles of the time, and used as a synonym for the Albanian language.[98] Published in Rome in 1635, by the Albanian bishop and writer Frang Bardhi, the first dictionary of the Albanian language was titled [[Latin language]]: Dictionarium latino-epiroticum 'Latin-Epirotan dictionary'.[99][100]
During the five-century period of the [[Ottoman Albania]] in [[Albania]], the language was not officially recognised until 1909, when the [[Congress of Dibra]] decided that Albanian schools would finally be allowed.[101]
Albanian is an [[Language isolate]] within the Indo-European language family; no other language has been conclusively linked to its [[Language family#Subdivision]].
The only other languages that are the sole surviving members of a branch of Indo-European are [[Armenian language]] and Greek.[102][a]
The Albanian language is part of the [[Indo-European languages]] [[Language family]] and the only surviving representative of [[Albanoid]], which belongs to the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]].[103][24][104][105][106] However, it is still uncertain exactly which ancient language of the Balkans is the ancestor of Albanian or where in the region its speakers originally lived.[b] In general, there is insufficient evidence to connect Albanian with one of those languages, whether [[Illyrian language]], [[Thracian language]], or [[Dacian language]].[c] Among these possibilities, Illyrian is the most probable.[d]
Although Albanian shares lexical [[Isogloss]] with [[Greek language]], [[Germanic languages]], and to a lesser extent [[Balto-Slavic languages]], the vocabulary of Albanian is quite distinct.[109] In 1995, Taylor, [[Donald Ringe]], and [[Tandy Warnow]] used [[Quantitative comparative linguistics]] techniques that appeared to obtain an Albanian subgrouping with Germanic, a result which the authors had already reasonably downplayed.[clarification needed][110][111] Indeed, the Albanian and Germanic branches share a relatively moderate number of lexical cognates.
Many shared grammatical elements or features of these two branches do not corroborate the lexical isoglosses.[111] Albanian also shares [[Lexicon]] linguistic affinity with Latin and Romance languages.[112][113][114] Sharing linguistic features unique to the [[Languages of the Balkans]], Albanian also forms a part of the [[Balkan sprachbund]].[115][116]
Hamp]] has said that during an unknown chronological period a pre-Albanian population (termed as "Albanoid" by Hamp) inhabited areas stretching from [[Poland]] to the southwestern Balkans.[118] Further analysis has suggested that it was in a mountainous region rather than on a plain or seacoast.
The words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, but the names for fish and for agricultural activities (such as [[Plough]]) are borrowed from other languages.[104][119]
A deeper analysis of the vocabulary, however, shows that could be a consequence of a prolonged [[Latin]] domination of the coastal and plain areas of the country, rather than evidence of the original environment in which the Albanian language was formed.
This, again, points to intense contact with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible [[Linguistic homeland]] (also known as a Urheimat).[citation needed]
The centre of Albanian settlement remained the [[Mat (river)]] River.
In 1079, the Albanians were recorded farther south in the valley of the [[Shkumbin]] River.[120] The Shkumbin, a 181 km long river that lies near the old [[Via Egnatia]], is approximately the boundary of the primary dialect division for Albanian, [[Tosk Albanian]] and [[Gheg Albanian]].
The characteristics of Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native words and loanwords from other languages are evidence that the dialectal split preceded the [[Slavic migrations to the Balkans]],[75][32][121] which means that in that period (the 5th to 6th centuries AD), Albanians were occupying nearly the same area around the Shkumbin river, which straddled the [[Jireček Line]].[122][119]
The oldest surviving documents written in Albanian are the "[[Formula e pagëzimit]]" (Baptismal formula), Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit.
("I baptize thee in [[Trinitarian formula]]") recorded by Pal Engjelli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some [[New Testament]] verses from that period.
The linguists Stefan Schumacher and Joachim Matzinger (University of Vienna) assert that the first literary records of Albanian date from the 16th century.[123][124] The oldest known Albanian printed book, [[Meshari]], or "missal", was written in 1555 by [[Gjon Buzuku]], a [[Roman Catholic]] cleric.
In 1635, [[Frang Bardhi]] wrote the first Latin–Albanian dictionary.
The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by [[Franciscans]] in 1638 in Pdhanë.
One of the earliest Albanian dictionaries was written in 1693; it was the [[Italian language]] manuscript Pratichae Schrivaneschae authored by the Montenegrin sea captain [[Julije Balović]] and includes a multilingual dictionary of hundreds of the most frequently used words in everyday life in Italian, Slavic, Greek, Albanian, and [[Turkish language]].[125]
Such PreIE sites existed in Maliq, [[Vashtëmi]], [[Burimas]], [[Barç]], [[Dërsnik]] in the [[Korçë District]], [[Kamnik]] in [[Kolonja]], Kolsh in the [[Kukës District]], Rashtan in [[Librazhd]], and Nezir in the [[Mat District]].[126] As in other parts of Europe, these PreIE people joined the migratory Indo-European tribes that entered the Balkans and contributed to the formation of the historical Paleo-Balkan tribes.
In terms of linguistics, the pre-Indo-European substrate language spoken in the southern Balkans probably influenced [[Proto-Albanian language]], the ancestor idiom of Albanian.[126] The extent of this linguistic impact cannot be determined with precision due to the uncertain position of Albanian among [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] and their scarce attestation.[127] Some loanwords, however, have been proposed, such as shegë '[[Pomegranate]]' or lëpjetë '[[Atriplex]]'; compare Pre-Greek λάπαθον, lápathon '[[Rumex alpinus]]'.[128][126]
In 1967 two scholars claimed to have found a Letter text in Albanian inserted into the [[Bellifortis]] text, a book written in Latin dating to 1402–1405.[135]
[[Robert Elsie]], a specialist in Albanian studies, considers that "The Todericiu/Polena Romanian translation of the non-Latin lines, although it may offer some clues if the text is indeed Albanian, is fanciful and based, among other things, on a false reading of the manuscript, including the exclusion of a whole line."[136]
In 1635, [[Frang Bardhi]] (1606–1643) published in [[Rome]] his Dictionarum latinum-epiroticum, the first known Latin-Albanian dictionary.
Other scholars who studied the language during the 17th century include [[Andrea Bogdani]] (1600–1685), author of the first Latin-Albanian grammar book, Nilo Katalanos (1637–1694) and others.[137]

The palatals, velars, and labiovelars show distinct developments, with Albanian showing the three-way distinction also found in [[Luwian language]].[138][139] Labiovelars are for the most part differentiated from all other Indo-European velar series before front vowels, but they merge with the "pure" (back) velars elsewhere.[138] The palatal velar series, consisting of Proto-Indo-European *ḱ and the merged *ģ and *ģʰ, usually developed into *th and *dh, but were depalatalised to merge with the back velars when in contact with [[Sonorant]].[138] Because the original Proto-Indo-European tripartite distinction between dorsals is preserved in such reflexes, Albanian is therefore neither [[Centum-satem]], despite having a "satem-like" realization of the palatal dorsals in most cases.[139] Thus PIE *ḱ, *k, and *kʷ become th, q, and s, respectively (before back vowels PIE *ḱ becomes th, while *k and *kʷ merge as k).
A minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth [[Laryngeal theory]] *h₄ allegedly surfacing as Alb.
Since [[World War II]], standard Albanian used in Albania has been based on the [[Tosk Albanian]].
Until the early 20th century, Albanian writing developed in three main literary traditions: [[Gheg]], [[Tosk]], and [[Arbëreshë language]].
Throughout this time, a Gheg subdialect spoken around [[Elbasan]] served as lingua franca among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing.
The [[Congress of Manastir]] of Albanian writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language.
Between 1916 and 1918, the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] met in Shkodër under the leadership of [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language.
Standardisation was directed by the [[Albanian Institute of Linguistics and Literature]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].[144] Two dictionaries were published in 1954: an Albanian language dictionary and a Russian–Albanian dictionary.
Although it was never intended to serve outside of Albania, the project became the "unified literary language" in 1972, when approved by a rubberstamp [[Albanian Orthography Congress]].
More recent dictionaries from the Albanian government are Fjalori Drejtshkrimor i Gjuhës Shqipe (1976) (Orthographic Dictionary of the Albanian Language)[148] and Dictionary of Today's Albanian language (Fjalori i Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe) (1980).[144][149] Prior to World War II, dictionaries consulted by developers of the standard have included Lexikon tis Alvanikis glossis (Albanian: Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe ([[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], 1904),[150] Fjalori i Bashkimit (1908),[150] and Fjalori i Gazullit (1941).[79]
Supporters of the Tosk standard view the [[Albanian Orthography Congress]] as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to "divide the nation" or "create two languages." Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me + participle' infinitive and Gheg words should be included.
Standard Albanian has seven [[Vowel]] and 29 [[Consonant]].
[[Gheg Albanian]] uses [[Long vowel]] and [[Nasal vowel]], which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian]], and the mid-central vowel ë is lost at the end of the word.
Gheg n (femën: compare English feminine) changes to r by [[Rhotacism (sound change)]] in Tosk (femër).
The schwa in Albanian has a great degree of variability from extreme back to extreme front articulation.[154] Although the Indo-European [[Schwa]] (*ə or *-h₂-) was preserved in Albanian, in some cases it was lost, possibly when a [[Stressed syllable]] preceded it.[155] Until the standardisation of the modern [[Albanian alphabet]], in which the schwa is spelled as ⟨ë⟩, as in the work of [[Gjon Buzuku]] in the 16th century, various vowel letters and digraphs were employed, including ⟨ae⟩ by [[Lekë Matrënga]] and ⟨é⟩ by [[Pjetër Bogdani]] in the late 16th and early 17th century.[156][157] Within the borders of Albania, the phoneme is pronounced about the same in both the Tosk and the Gheg dialect due to the influence of standard Albanian.
Albanian has a canonical word order of [[Subject–verb–object]] (subject–verb–object) like English and many other Indo-European languages.[158] Albanian [[Noun]] are categorised by [[Grammatical gender]] (masculine, feminine and neuter) and [[Albanian morphology]] for [[Grammatical number]] (singular and plural) and [[Grammatical case]].
There are five [[Declension]] and six cases ([[Nominative]], [[Accusative]], [[Genitive]], [[Dative case]], [[Ablative]], and [[Vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words (such as 'bir' ("son"), vocative case: biro, zog ("bird") vocative case: zogo[159]), and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive construction employs the prepositions i/e/të/së alongside dative morphemes).
The cases apply to both [[Definiteness]] nouns, and there are numerous cases of [[Syncretism (linguistics)]].
The definite article is placed after the noun as in many other [[Balkan languages]], like in [[Romanian language]], [[Macedonian language]] and [[Bulgarian language]].
Albanian has developed an analytical [[Verb]] structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European language]].
Its complex system of [[Grammatical mood]] (six types) and [[Grammatical tense]] (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among [[Balkan languages]].
There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation]].
Albanian has a series of [[Verb form]] called miratives or [[Admirative]].
These may express surprise on the part of the speaker, but may also have other functions, such as expressing [[Irony]], [[Doubt]], or [[Evidentiality]].[160] The Albanian use of admirative forms is unique in the [[Balkan sprachbund]].
For more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see [[Albanian morphology]].
However, the most common order is [[Subject–verb–object]].
Verbal negation in Albanian is mood-dependent, a trait shared with some fellow [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Greek language]].
Beside the Indo-European decimal numeration, there are also remnants of the [[Vigesimal]], as njëzet 'twenty' and dyzet 'forty'.
The [[Arbëreshë people]] in Italy and [[Arvanites]] in Greece may still use trezet 'sixty' and katërzet 'eighty'.
Albanian is the only Balkan language that has preserved the [[Pre-Indo-European languages]] vigesimal system.[165]
Albanian is known within historical linguistics as a case of a language which, although surviving through many periods of foreign rule and multilingualism, saw a "disproportionately high" influx of [[Loanword]] from other languages augmenting and replacing much of its original [[Vocabulary]].[166][clarification needed] Of all the foreign influences in Albanian, the deepest reaching and most impactful was the absorption of loans from Latin in the Classical period and its Romance successors afterward.
Major work in reconstructing Proto-Albanian has been done with the help of knowledge of the original forms of loans from Ancient Greek, Latin and Slavic, while Ancient Greek loanwords are scarce the Latin loanwords are of extreme importance in [[Phonology]].[168] The presence of loanwords from more well-studied languages from time periods before Albanian was attested, reaching deep back into the Classical Era, has been of great use in phonological reconstructions for earlier ancient and medieval forms of Albanian.[166] Some words in the core vocabulary of Albanian have no known etymology linking them to Proto-Indo-European or any known source language, and as of 2018 are thus tentatively attributed to an unknown, unattested, pre-Indo-European substrate language; some words among these include zemër (heart) and hekur (iron).[169] Some among these putative pre-IE words are thought to be related to putative pre-IE substrate words in neighboring Indo-European languages, such as lule (flower), which has been tentatively linked to Latin lilia and Greek leirion.[170]
Lexical distance of Albanian to other languages in a [[Lexicostatistics]] analysis by Ukrainian linguist Tyshchenko shows the following results (the lower figure, the higher similarity): 49% [[Slovenian language]], 53% [[Romanian language]], 56% [[Greek language]], 82% [[French language]], 86% [[Macedonian language]], 86% [[Bulgarian language]].[171][172]
The earliest [[Loanword]] attested in Albanian come from [[Doric Greek]],[188] whereas the strongest influence came from [[Latin]].[189] Some scholars argue that Albanian originated from an area located east of its present geographic spread due to the several [[Albanian–Romanian linguistic relationship]] found between the Albanian and [[Romanian language]] languages.
However it does not necessarily define the genealogical history of Albanian language, and it does not exclude the possibility of [[Proto-Albanian language]] presence in both [[Illyrians]] and [[Thracians]] territory.[190]
The final period, probably preceding the [[Migration Period]], also has a notably smaller number of borrowings.
Each layer is characterised by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably [[Proto-Romance language]]).
A brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from [[South Slavic languages]], some of which predate the "o-a" shift common to the modern forms of this language group.
There are some 30 [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords in [[Proto-Albanian language]].[191] Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect.
[[Jernej Kopitar]] (1780–1844) was the first to note Latin's influence on Albanian and claimed "the Latin loanwords in the Albanian language had the pronunciation of the time of Emperor Augustus".[200] Kopitar gave examples such as Albanian qiqer 'chickpea' from Latin cicer, qytet 'city, town' from civitas, peshk 'fish' from piscis, and shigjetë 'arrow' from sagitta.
Gustav Meyer (1888)[201] and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]] (1914)[202] later corroborated this.
[[Johann Georg von Hahn]], an Austrian linguist, had proposed the same hypothesis in 1854.[203]
[[Eqrem Çabej]] also noticed, among other things, the archaic Latin elements in Albanian:[204]
Other authors[208] have detected Latin loanwords in Albanian that could come from [[Palatalization in the Romance languages]] of velar consonants,[209] as early as the 2nd or 3rd century.[210] For example, Albanian qingël(ë) 'saddle girth; dwarf elder' from Latin cingula and Albanian e vjetër 'old, aged; former' from vjet but influenced by Latin veteris.
The [[Romance languages]] inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: cingula became (via *clinga) Romanian chingă 'girdle; saddle girth', and [[Veteranus]] became Romanian bătrân 'old'.
Albanian, [[Basque language]], and the surviving [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Breton language]] and [[Welsh language]] are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages.
Romanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and [[Dalmatian language]].
Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly fewer in number than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact with Western Romance regions than with Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to [[Bitola]] and [[Pristina]].[211]
After the [[Slavs]] arrived in the Balkans, the [[Slavic languages]] became an additional source of loanwords.
Per [[Vladimir Orel]] (1998),[181][page needed] there are about 556 Slavic loanwords in Albanian.
The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish.
Albanian is also known to possess a small set of loans from [[Gothic language]], with early inquiry into the matter done by [[Norbert Jokl]][213] and [[Sigmund Feist]],[214] though such loans had been claimed earlier in the 19th century by early linguists such as [[Gustav Meyer]].
Martin Huld[218] defends the significance of the admittedly sparse Gothic loans for Albanian studies, however, arguing that Gothic is the only clearly post-Roman and "pre-Ottoman" language after Latin with a notable influence on the Albanian lexicon (the influence of Slavic languages is both pre-Ottoman and Ottoman).[218] He argues that Gothic words in Albanian are attributable to the late fourth and early fifth centuries during the invasions of various Gothic speaking groups of the Balkans under [[Alaric I]], [[Odoacer]], and [[Theodoric]].
Although Albanian is characterised by the absorption of many loans, even, in the case of Latin, reaching deep into the core vocabulary, certain [[Semantic field]] nevertheless remained more resistant.
Albanian has maintained native terms for "whirlpool", "water pit" and (aquatic) "deep place", leading Orel to speculate that the Albanian [[Urheimat]] likely had an excess of dangerous whirlpools and depths.[229]
