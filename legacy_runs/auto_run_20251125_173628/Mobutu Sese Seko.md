Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu wa za Banga[a] (/məˈbuːtuː ˈsɛseɪ ˈsɛkoʊ/ ⓘ mə-BOO-too SESS-ay SEK-oh; born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu; 14 October 1930 – 7 September 1997), often shortened to Mobutu Sese Seko or Mobutu and also known by his initials MSS, was a Congolese politician and military officer who was the first and only [[President of Zaire]] from 1971 to 1997.
Previously, Mobutu served as the second [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], from 1965 to 1971.
He also served as the fifth [[Chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity]] from 1967 to 1968.
During the [[Congo Crisis]] in 1960, Mobutu, then serving as Chief of Staff of the Congolese Army, deposed the nation's democratically elected government of [[Patrice Lumumba]] with the support of the U.S. and Belgium.
To consolidate his power, he established the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] as the [[One-party state]] in 1967, changed the Congo's name to [[Zaire]] in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972.
Mobutu protected his rule through an intensely [[Autocracy]] regime and came to preside over a period of widespread human rights violations.
He attempted to purge the country of all [[Colonization of the Congo]] through his program of "[[Authenticité (Zaire)]]".[1][2] Mobutu was the object of a pervasive [[Cult of personality]].[3]
Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was "neither left nor right, nor even centre",[4] but was primarily recognized for his opposition to [[Communism]] within the [[Françafrique]] region and received strong support (military, diplomatic and economic) from the United States, France, and Belgium given the fact.
He also built close ties with the governments of [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]], [[Israel]], and the [[Greek junta]].[5]
Mobutu was notorious for corruption and nepotism: estimates of his personal wealth range from $50 million to $5 billion,[6][7] amassed through economic exploitation and corruption as president.[8] His rule has been called a [[Kleptocracy]][9][10] for allowing this personal fortune even as the [[Economy of Zaire]] suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency [[Devaluation]].
Mobutu was further known for extravagances such as shopping trips to Paris via the supersonic [[Concorde]] aircraft.[11]
In May 1997, rebel forces led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] overran the country and forced him into exile.
Already suffering from advanced [[Prostate cancer]], he died three months later in Morocco.
Mobutu, a member of the [[Ngbandi people]] ethnic group,[12] was born in 1930 in [[Lisala]], [[Belgian Congo]].[13] Mobutu's mother, Marie Madeleine Yemo, was a hotel maid who fled to Lisala to escape the [[Harem]] of a local village chief.
The Belgian judge's wife took a liking to Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write fluently in [[French language]],[17] the official language of the colony.
Mobutu's earliest education took place in the capital [[Kinshasa]] (now Kinshasa).
His mother eventually sent him to an uncle in [[Mbandaka]] (present-day Mbandaka), where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school.
At the end of the school year, in lieu of being sent to prison, he was ordered to serve seven years in the colonial army, the [[Force Publique]] (FP).
Mobutu found discipline in army life, as well as a father figure in Sergeant [[Louis Bobozo]].
His favorites were the writings of French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], and Italian Renaissance philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].
In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist,[21] writing for the Léopoldville daily [[L'Avenir (Congolese newspaper)]].[22]
Two years later, he went to Belgium to cover the [[Expo '58]] and stayed to receive training in journalism.
He became friendly with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and joined Lumumba's [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC).
On 5 July 1960, soldiers of the [[Force Publique]] stationed at Camp Léopold II in Léopoldville, dissatisfied with their all-white leadership and working conditions, [[1960 Force Publique mutinies]].
Mobutu assisted other officials in negotiating with the mutineers to secure the release of the officers and their families.[27] On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] at Camp Léopold II to address the task of Africanising the garrison.[28]
The two main candidates for the post were Minister of Youth and Sports [[Maurice Mpolo]] and Mobutu.
The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a [[Coup d'état]] if he were given power.
Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters.[29] In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel.[30] The following day government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the army; Mobutu was sent to [[Équateur (former province)]].[31] While he was there Mpolo acted as ANC Chief of Staff.[32][33] Mobutu was affronted by this development, and upon his return to the capital he confronted Lumumba in a cabinet meeting, saying, "Either I was unworthy, and you have to dismiss me, or I faithfully accomplished my mission and so I keep my rank and functions."[33]
The British diplomat [[Brian Urquhart]] serving with the United Nations wrote: "When I first met Mobutu in July 1960, he was Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba's chief military assistant and had just promoted himself from sergeant to lieutenant-colonel.
Concerned that the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union]] for assistance.
As this was during the [[Cold War]], the US government feared that the Soviet activity was a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa.
On 14 September Mobutu launched a bloodless coup, declaring both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to be "neutralised" and establishing a new government of university graduates, the [[College of Commissioners-General]].
Losing confidence that the international community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November to join his supporters in [[Kisangani]] to establish a [[Free Republic of the Congo]].
He was captured by Mobutu's troops in early December, and incarcerated at his headquarters in [[Mbanza-Ngungu]].
However, Mobutu still considered him a threat, and transferred him to the rebelling [[State of Katanga]] on 17 January 1961.
It was later discovered that he was executed the same day by the secessionist forces of [[Moise Tshombe]], after Mobutu's government turned him over.[38]
In 1964, [[Pierre Mulele]] led partisans in another rebellion.
Prime Minister Moise Tshombe's [[Congolese National Convention]] had won a large majority in the [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], but Kasa-Vubu appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, [[Évariste Kimba]], as prime minister-designate.
Under the auspices of a [[State of exception]] (regime d'exception), Mobutu assumed sweeping—almost absolute—powers for five years.[42] In his first speech upon taking power, Mobutu told a large crowd at Léopoldville's main stadium that, since politicians had brought the Congo to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right again, and therefore there would be no more political party activity for five years.[43] On 30 November 1965 Parliament approved a measure which turned over most legislative powers to Mobutu and his cabinet, though it retained the right to review his decrees.
In 1966, Mobutu started renaming cities that had European names with more "authentic" African names, and in this way Léopoldville became Kinshasa, Stanleyville became Kisangani and Élisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]].[45]
1967 marked the debut of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party.
That same year, all trade unions were consolidated into a single union, the [[National Union of Congolese Workers]], and brought under government control.
Uprisings by former Katangan gendarmeries were crushed, as were the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] of 1967 led by white mercenaries.[48] By 1970, nearly all potential threats to his authority had been smashed, and for the most part, law and order was brought to nearly all parts of the country.
In 1970 King [[Baudouin of Belgium]] made a highly successful state visit to [[Kinshasa]].
That same year [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo presidential election]] and [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo parliamentary election]] elections were held.
These included the [[Special Presidential Division]], [[Civil Guard (Zaire)]] and Service for Action, and Military Intelligence (SNIP).[52]
Embarking on a campaign of pro-Africa cultural awareness, called [[Authenticité (Zaire)]], Mobutu began renaming cities that reflected the colonial past, starting on 1 June 1966: Léopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani.
In October 1971, he renamed the country as the [[Republic of Zaire]].[45][53] He ordered the people to change their European names to African ones, and priests were warned that they would face five years' imprisonment if they were caught [[Baptism]] a Zairian child with a European name.[45] Western attire and ties were banned, and men were forced to wear a [[Mao suit]] known as an [[Abacost]] (shorthand for à bas le costume, or "down with the suit").[54] Christmas was moved from December to June because it was more of an "authentic" date.[45]
In 1972, in accordance with his own decree of a year earlier, Mobutu renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (meaning "The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.").[55][56] Around this time, he eschewed his military uniform in favor of what would become his classic image—the tall, imposing man carrying a walking stick while wearing an abacost, thick-framed glasses, and a leopard-skin [[Toque]] made in Paris.[57][58]
In 1974, a [[Constitution of Zaire]] consolidated Mobutu's grip on the country.
At one of those elections, in [[1975 Zairean parliamentary election]], formal voting was dispensed with altogether.
Instead, the election took place by [[Acclamation]]; candidates were presented at public locations around the country where they would be applauded into parliament.[59]
To set an example, many were [[Hanging]] before large audiences.
Such victims included former Prime Minister [[Évariste Kimba]], who, with three cabinet members—Jérôme Anany (Defense Minister), Emmanuel Bamba (Finance Minister), and Alexandre Mahamba (Minister of Mines and Energy)—was tried in May 1966, and sent to the gallows on 30 May, before an audience of 50,000 spectators.
In 1968, [[Pierre Mulele]], Lumumba's Minister of Education and a rebel leader during the 1964 [[Simba rebellion]], was lured out of exile in [[Brazzaville]] on the belief that he would receive amnesty.
Mobutu demanded absolute personal allegiance in return for the opportunity to accumulate wealth".[63] As early as 1970, it was estimated that Mobutu had stolen 60% of the national budget that year, marking him as one of the most corrupt leaders in Africa and the world.[63] Kisangani wrote that Mobutu created a system of [[Institutional corruption]] that greatly debased public morality by rewarding venality and greed.[64]
In 1972, Mobutu tried unsuccessfully to have himself named [[President for life]].[65] In June 1983, he raised himself to the rank of [[Marshal]];[66] the order was signed by General Likulia Bolongo.
[[Victor Nendaka Bika]], in his capacity as Vice-President of the Bureau of the Central Committee, second authority in the land, addressed a speech filled with praise for President Mobutu.
To gain the revenues of Congolese resources, Mobutu initially [[Nationalization]] foreign-owned firms and forced European investors out of the country.
In 1973–1974, Mobutu launched his "Zairianization" campaign, nationalising foreign owned businesses that were handed over to Zairians.[45] In October 1973, the Arab [[1973 oil crisis]] ended the "long summer" of prosperity in the West that had begun in 1945, and sent the world economy into its sharpest contraction since the Great Depression.
By 1977, Mobutu's nationalizations had precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced to try to woo foreign investors back.[68] Katangan rebels based in [[Angola]] invaded Zaire that year, in retaliation for Mobutu's support for anti-[[MPLA]] rebels.
France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan paratroopers into the country and repulsed the rebels, ending [[Shaba I]].
The rebels attacked Zaire again, in greater numbers, in the [[Shaba II]] invasion of 1978.
The poor performance of the Zairian Army during both Shaba invasions, which humiliated Mobutu by forcing him to ask for foreign troops, did not lead to military reforms.[69] However, Mobutu reduced the size of the Army from 51,000 troops in 1978 down to 23,000 troops in 1980.[69] By 1980, it was estimated that about 90% of the Zairian Army were Ngbandi as Mobutu did not trust the other peoples of Zaire to serve in the Army.[69] The most loyal and best of Mobutu's units were his bodyguards, the [[Israel]]-trained [[Special Presidential Division]] (Division Spéciale Présidentielle) that was made up exclusively of Ngbandi and was always commanded by one of Mobutu's relatives.[70]
Mobutu was re-elected in single-candidate elections in [[1977 Zairean presidential election]] and [[1984 Zairean presidential election]].
He spent most of his time increasing his personal fortune, which in 1988 was estimated to amount to no less than US$50 million.[71] He held most of it out of the country in [[Swiss banking]] (however, a comparatively small $3.4 million was declared found in Swiss banks after he was ousted.[72]).
Mobutu owned a fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads deteriorated and many of his people starved.
A popular saying that "the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them" expressed this grim reality.[74] The [[Forces Armées Zaïroises]] (FAZ) suffered from low morale made worse by irregular salaries, dismal living conditions, shortages of supplies and a venal officer corps.[75] The soldiers of the FAZ behaved very much like a brutal occupying force who supported themselves by robbing the civilian population of Zaire.[75] A recurring feature of Mobutu's rule were the seemingly endless number of roadblocks put by the FAZ who extorted money from the drivers of any passing automobile or lorries.[75]
In [[Gbadolite]], he erected a palace, the "[[Palace of Versailles]] of the jungle".[77] For shopping trips to Paris, he would charter a [[Concorde]] from [[Air France]]; he had the [[Gbadolite Airport]] constructed with a runway long enough to accommodate the Concorde's extended take-off and landing requirements.[78] In 1989, Mobutu chartered Concorde aircraft F-BTSD for a 26 June – 5 July trip to give a speech at the [[United Nations Headquarters]], then again on 16 July for [[French Revolution]] celebrations in Paris (where he was a guest of President [[François Mitterrand]]), and on 19 September for a flight from Paris to Gbadolite, and another nonstop flight from Gbadolite to [[Marseille]] with the youth choir of Zaire.[79] Mobutu owned a villa on the [[French Riviera]], Villa del Mere.[80]
Mobutu's rule earned a reputation as one of the world's foremost examples of [[Kleptocracy]] and [[Nepotism]].[81]  Close relatives and fellow members of the Ngbandi tribe were awarded high positions in the military and government, and he groomed his eldest son, Nyiwa, to succeed him as president;[82] however, Nyiwa died from [[AIDS]] in 1994.[83]
Mobutu led one of the most enduring autocracies in Africa and amassed a personal fortune estimated to be over US$50 million by selling his nation's rich natural resources while the people lived in poverty.[84][85] While in office, he formed a [[Totalitarian regime]] responsible for numerous [[Human rights violations]], attempted to purge the country of all Belgian cultural influences, and maintained an [[Anti-communist]] stance to gain positive international support.[43][86]
Mobutu was the subject of one of the most pervasive [[Personality cult]] of the twentieth century.
In the [[When We Were Kings]] of the [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] in Zaire, dancers receiving the fighters can be heard chanting "Sese Seko, Sese Seko".
Mobutu successfully capitalized on [[Cold War]] tensions among European nations and the United States.
He gained significant support from the West and its international organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]].[89]
In the late 1970s, the West Germany company [[OTRAG]] was developing a program to send peaceful satellites into space at lower costs, but a 1954 amendment to the [[Treaty of Brussels]] prevented them from developing and launching missiles in Germany.[90] As a result, they paid Mobutu $130 million to develop their program in Zaire.[91] In a 1978 agreement with OTRAG, Mobutu gave the company a 25-year rented plot of land in Zaire.[90] The first rocket, [[OTRAG (rocket)]], was launched on 18 May 1977,[90] while Mobutu watched from a distance.[91] The rocket took off successfully, but shortly afterwards fell and crashed back down to the ground.[90][91]
During [[King Baudouin]]'s highly successful visit to [[Kinshasa]] in 1970, a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries was signed.
However, Mobutu tore up the treaty in 1974 in protest at Belgium's refusal to ban an anti-Mobutu book written by left-wing lawyer Jules Chomé.[94] Mobutu's "[[Authenticité (Zaire)]]" policy, which expropriated foreign-held businesses and transferred their ownership to Zairians, added to the strain.[95] Mobutu maintained several personal contacts with prominent Belgians.
[[Edmond Leburton]], Belgian prime minister between 1973 and 1974, was someone greatly admired by the President.[96] Alfred Cahen, career diplomat and chef de cabinet of minister [[Henri Simonet]], became a personal friend of Mobutu when he was a student at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]].[97] Relations with King Baudouin were mostly cordial, until Mobutu released a bold statement about the [[Monarchy of Belgium]].
Prime Minister [[Wilfried Martens]] recalled in his memoirs that the palace gates closed completely after Mobutu published a handwritten letter of the King.[98] Because of that, Mobutu was one of only two heads of state who did not receive an invitation to the funeral of Baudouin, the other being [[Saddam Hussein]] of [[Ba'athist Iraq]].
Some of them, such as Hugues Leclercq and [[Colonel]] Willy Mallants, were interviewed in [[Thierry Michel]]'s documentary [[Mobutu, King of Zaire]].[citation needed]
As then the second most populous French-speaking country in the world (it has subsequently come to have a larger population than France) and the most populous one in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],[99] Zaire was of great strategic interest to France.[100] During the [[Congo Crisis#The First Republic]] era, France tended to side with the conservative and federalist forces, as opposed to unitarists such as Lumumba.[99] Shortly after the [[Katanga Province]] secession was successfully crushed, Zaire (then called the Republic of the Congo) signed a treaty of technical and cultural cooperation with France.
During the [[Presidency of Charles de Gaulle]] of [[Charles de Gaulle]], diplomatic relations between the two countries gradually grew stronger and closer due to their many shared geopolitical interests.
In 1971, Finance Minister [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] paid a visit to Zaire; later, after becoming France's president, he would develop a close personal relationship with President Mobutu, and under his leadership, France became one of the Mobutu regime's closest and most important foreign allies.[101] During the Shaba invasions, France sided firmly with Mobutu: during the [[Shaba I]], France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops to Zaire, and the rebels were repulsed;[102] a year later, during the [[Shaba II]], France itself (along with Belgium) would send [[French Foreign Legion]] paratroopers ([[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment]]) to aid Mobutu.[103][104][105]
Memories of Chinese aid to Mulele and other Maoist rebels in Kwilu province during the ill-fated [[Simba Rebellion]] remained fresh on Mobutu's mind.
However, by 1972, he began to see the Chinese in a different light, as a counterbalance to both the Soviet Union as well as his intimate ties with the United States, [[Israel]], and South Africa.[106][107] In November 1972, Mobutu extended diplomatic recognition to the Chinese (as well as [[East Germany]] and [[North Korea]]).
The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met with chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and received promises of $100 million in technical aid.[108] In 1983, Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhao Ziyang]] announced on a trip to Zaire that the money would not have to be repaid.[109]
Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (and later, the [[UNITA]]) in order to prevent their former allies, the [[MPLA]], who were supported and augmented by [[Military of Cuba]], from coming to power.
In addition to inviting [[Holden Roberto]], the leader of the National Liberation Front of Angola, and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels.
However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968.[112] Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year.[113] Mobutu viewed the Soviet presence as advantageous for two reasons: it allowed him to maintain an image of non-alignment, and it provided a convenient scapegoat for problems at home.
For example, in 1970, he expelled four Soviet diplomats for carrying out "subversive activities", and in 1971, twenty Soviet officials were declared [[Persona non grata]] for allegedly instigating student demonstrations at [[Lovanium University]].[114]
[[Moscow]] was the only major world capital Mobutu never visited, although he did accept an invitation to do so in 1974.
Relations cooled further in 1975, when the two countries found themselves on opposing sides in the [[Angolan Civil War]].
This had a dramatic effect on Zairian foreign policy for the next decade; bereft of his claim to African leadership (Mobutu was one of the few leaders who refused to recognize the Marxist government of Angola), Mobutu turned increasingly to the US and its allies, adopting pro-American stances on such issues as the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and [[Israel]]'s position in international organizations.[115]
The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H.
Relations did cool significantly in 1974–1975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy),[116] and plummeted to an all-time low in the summer of 1975, when Mobutu accused the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (in absentia) a former head of the Central Bank ([[Albert Ndele]]).[116] However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]], speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule.[117] In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.[118]
Because of Mobutu's poor human rights record, the [[Jimmy Carter]] put some distance between itself and the [[Kinshasa]] government;[119] even so, Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].[120] During the first Shaba invasion, the United States played a relatively inconsequential role; its belated intervention consisted of little more than the delivery of non-lethal supplies.
Carter echoed Mobutu's (unsubstantiated) charges of Soviet and Cuban aid to the rebels, until it was apparent that no hard evidence existed to verify his claims.[121] In 1980, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to terminate military aid to Zaire, but the [[United States Senate]] reinstated the funds, in response to pressure from Carter and American business interests in Zaire.[122]
Mobutu enjoyed a very warm relationship with the [[Reagan Administration]], through financial donations.
During Reagan's presidency, Mobutu visited the [[White House]] three times, and criticism of Zaire's human rights record by the US was effectively muted.
Bush; he was the first African head of state to visit Bush at the [[White House]].[124] Even so, Mobutu's relationship with the US radically changed shortly afterward with the end of the [[Cold War]].
With the [[Revolutions of 1989]] of the [[Soviet Union]]'s status as a world superpower, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism.
The lesson is that my support for American policy counts for nothing."[125] In 1993, Mobutu was denied a [[Visa (document)]] by the [[United States Department of State]] after he sought to visit Washington, D.C.
Mobutu was befriended by televangelist [[Pat Robertson]], who promised to try to get the State Department to lift its ban on the African leader.[126]
In May 1990, due to the ending of the [[Cold War]] and a change in the international political climate, as well as economic problems and domestic unrest, Mobutu agreed to give up the MPR's monopoly of power.
In early May 1990, students studying at the [[Lubumbashi]] campus of the [[National University of Zaire]] protested against Mobutu's regime, demanding his resignation.[127] On the night of 11 May 1990, electricity was cut off to the campus while a special military unit called Les Hiboux ("The Owls") were sent in, armed with machetes and bayonets.[127] By the dawn of 12 May 1990, at least 290 students had been killed.[127] The massacre led to the nations of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the European Union), the United States, and Canada to end all non-humanitarian aid to Zaire, which marked the beginning of the end of Western support for Mobutu.[127]
Following the [[1991 Zaire unrest]] by unpaid soldiers, Mobutu brought opposition figures into a coalition government, but still connived to retain control of the security services and important ministries.
The anti-Mobutu government was headed by [[Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya]] and [[Étienne Tshisekedi]] of the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] (UDPS).[128]
Mobutu appointed [[Kengo Wa Dondo]], an advocate of [[Austerity]] and [[Free-market]] reforms, as prime minister.
During this period, Mobutu was becoming increasingly physically frail and during one of his trips to Europe for medical treatment, ethnic [[Tutsi]] captured much of eastern Zaire.
The seeds of Mobutu's downfall were sown in the [[Rwandan genocide]], when about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by about 200,000 Hutu extremists aided by the Rwandan government in 1994.
The genocide ended when the Tutsi-dominated [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] seized the whole country, leading hundreds of thousands of Hutus, including many of the [[Génocidaires]], to flee into refugee camps in eastern Zaire.
When Mobutu's government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire,[130] known as [[Banyamulenge]], were the focal point of a rebellion.
From eastern Zaire, the rebels, aided by foreign government forces under the leadership of President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of [[Uganda]] and Rwandan Minister of Defense [[Paul Kagame]] launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him under [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] as they marched west toward Kinshasa.
Burundi and Angola also supported the growing rebellion, which mushroomed into the [[First Congo War]].[citation needed]
Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was in [[Switzerland]] for treatment,[131] and he was unable to coordinate the resistance which crumbled in front of the march.
On 16 May 1997, failed peace talks were held in [[Pointe-Noire]] on board the [[South African Navy]] ship [[SAS Outeniqua]] with Kabila and President of South Africa [[Nelson Mandela]] acting as the chair of the talks.
I remember President Mandela, 78- years old himself at this time, had to prop him up as he walked to his car...It was really dreadful, on May 15th they were to meet again, Mobutu made the journey-Kabila hadn't bothered to attend."[133][failed verification]  Kabila's forces, known as the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (AFDL), proclaimed victory the next day.
On 23 May 1997, Zaire was renamed the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].[134]
Mobutu went into temporary exile in [[Togo]], until President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] insisted that Mobutu leave the country a few days later.[135] From 23 May 1997, he lived mostly in [[Rabat, Morocco]].[136]  He died there on 7 September 1997 from [[Prostate cancer]] at the age of 66.[137]  He is interred in an above ground mausoleum at Rabat, in the Christian cemetery known as Cimetière Européen.[138][139]
In December 2007, the [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] recommended returning his remains, and interring them in a mausoleum in the DRC, which has not yet taken place.
He married his first wife, [[Marie-Antoinette Mobutu]], in 1955.[141] They had nine children.
She died of [[Congestive heart failure]] on 22 October 1977 in [[Genolier]], [[Switzerland]], at the age of 36.
On 1 May 1980, he married his mistress, [[Bobi Ladawa Mobutu]], on the eve of a visit by [[Pope John Paul II]], thus legitimizing his relationship in the eyes of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].
Three more died in the years following his death: [[Kongulu Mobutu]] (d.
4 November 2011).[83] His elder son from his second marriage, [[Nzanga Mobutu]], now the head of the family, finished fourth in the [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] and later served in the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister of the day government.
Mobutu was the subject of the three-part 1999 Belgian documentary [[Mobutu, King of Zaire]] by [[Thierry Michel]].
Mobutu was also featured in the 2000 feature film [[Lumumba (film)]], directed by [[Raoul Peck]], which detailed the pre-coup and coup years from the perspective of Lumumba.
Mobutu also featured in the 1996 American documentary [[When We Were Kings]], which centred on the famed [[Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing bout between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]] for the 1974 [[Heavyweight]] championship of the world which took place in [[Kinshasa]] during Mobutu's rule.
In the 1978 war adventure film [[The Wild Geese]], the villain, General Ndofa, described in the film as an extremely corrupt leader of a copper-rich nation in central Africa, was a thinly disguised version of Mobutu.[144]
Mobutu also might be considered[original research?] as the inspiration behind some of the characters in the works of the poetry of [[Wole Soyinka]], the novel [[A Bend in the River]] by [[V.
Naipaul]], and [[Anthills of the Savannah]] by [[Chinua Achebe]].
[[William Close]], father of actress [[Glenn Close]], was once a personal physician to Mobutu and wrote a book focusing on his service in Zaire.
[[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s 1998 historical novel [[The Poisonwood Bible]] depicts the events of the [[Congo Crisis]] from a fictional standpoint, featuring the role of Mobutu in the crisis.
Mobutu was played by the Belgian actor [[Marc Zinga]] in the 2011 film [[Mister Bob]].
Mobutu was included as an additional promotional card in the card-driven strategy game [[Twilight Struggle]].
His card, when played, increases the [[Political stability]] of the country then known as Zaire and increases the influence of the United States over the African nation.[146] The 2015 song "Françafrique" by Swedish hardcore punk band [[Refused]] (from the album [[Freedom (Refused album)]]) directly references Mobutu in its lyrics — the song contains the lines: "Mobutu, Congo; pimp and whore / As Paris' puppets guard the door".[147][148]
According to Mobutu's [[The New York Times]] obituary: "He built his political longevity on three pillars: violence, cunning, and the use of state funds to buy off enemies.
His systematic looting of the national treasury and major industries gave birth to the term '[[Kleptocracy]]' to describe a rule of official corruption that reputedly made him one of the world's wealthiest heads of state."[149]
In 2011, [[Time (magazine)]] magazine described him as the "archetypal African dictator".[11]
According to [[Washington Post]], Mobutu amassed between US$50–125 million from his country, ranking him as the third-most corrupt leader since 1984 and the most corrupt African leader during the same period.[6] [[Philip Gourevitch]], in [[We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families]] (1998), wrote:
Mobutu had really staged a funeral for a generation of African leadership of which he—the Dinosaur, as he had long been known—was the paragon: the client dictator of [[Cold War]] [[Neocolonialism]], monomaniacal, perfectly corrupt, and absolutely ruinous to his nation.
Mobutu was instrumental in bringing the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]] to Zaire on 30 October 1974.
According to the documentary [[When We Were Kings]], promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)]] promised each fighter five million dollars (U.S.) for the fight.
According to a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: "Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars cost a lot more than ten million (dollars)." On 22 September 1974, Mobutu presented the rebuilt [[Stade Tata Raphaël]], a multi-million-dollar sports project constructed to host the Ali-Foreman boxing card, to the Zaire Ministry of Youth and Sport, and to the people of Zaire.[150]
