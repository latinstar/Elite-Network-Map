Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance (1995) is a [[Memoir]] by [[Barack Obama]] that explores the events of [[Early life and career of Barack Obama]] in [[Honolulu]] and [[Chicago]] until his entry into [[Harvard Law School]] in 1988.
Obama originally published his memoir in 1995, when he was starting his political campaign for the [[Illinois Senate]].[1]
After Obama won the [[2004 United States Senate election in Illinois]] in 2004, the book was re-published that year.
He gave the [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address]] (DNC) and won the US Senate seat in the fall.
Obama launched his [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign]] three years later.[2] The 2004 edition includes a new preface by Obama and his DNC keynote address.[2]
According to [[The New York Times]], Obama modeled Dreams from My Father on [[Ralph Ellison]]'s novel [[Invisible Man]].[3] The book, frequently praised for its literary qualities, has also been criticized for inaccuracies and over-use of [[Artistic license]].
[[Barack Obama]] recounts how his parents met and his own life until his enrollment at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1988.
His parents were [[Barack Obama Sr.]] of [[Kenya]], and [[Ann Dunham]] of [[Wichita, Kansas]], who had met while they were students at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]].
The elder Obama later went to Harvard to pursue his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in economics.
After her divorce, Ann Dunham married [[Lolo Soetoro]], a [[Javanese people]] [[Surveyor]] from [[Indonesia]] who was also a graduate student in Hawaii.
The family moved to [[Jakarta]] when Obama was six years old.
He was enrolled in the fifth grade at [[Punahou School]], a private [[College-preparatory]] school, where he was one of six black students.[6] Obama attended Punahou from the fifth grade until his graduation in 1979.
Obama writes in his book: "For my grandparents, my admission into Punahou Academy heralded the start of something grand, an elevation in the family status that they took great pains to let everyone know." There, he met Ray (Keith Kakugawa), who was two years older and also [[Multiracial Americans]].
He introduced Obama to the [[African-American]] community.[7]
Upon graduating from high school, Obama moved to the [[Contiguous United States]] for studies at [[Occidental College]].
He describes having lived a "party" lifestyle of [[Drug]] and [[Alcohol (drug)]] use.[8][9][10] After two years at Occidental, Obama transferred to [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] at [[Columbia University]], where he majored in [[Political Science]].[10] After graduation, Obama worked for a year in business.
He moved to [[Chicago]], where he worked for a [[Non-profit]] as a [[Community organizing]] in the [[Altgeld Gardens Homes (Chicago, Illinois)]] [[Public housing]] on the city's mostly black [[South Side, Chicago]].
During this period, Obama first visited Chicago's [[Trinity United Church of Christ]], which became the center of his religious life.[10] Before attending Harvard, Obama decided to visit relatives in Kenya for the first time in his life.
Obama acknowledged his entire memoir to reflect on his personal experiences with [[Racism in the United States]].
The reviewer, novelist [[Paul Watkins (novelist)]], wrote that Obama "persuasively describes the phenomenon of belonging to two different worlds, and thus belonging to neither." However, Watkins questioned whether Obama's narrative suggested that people of mixed backgrounds must choose only one culture, which seemed at odds with America's diverse nature, writing "[i]f this is indeed true, as Mr. Obama tells it, then the idea of America taking pride in itself as a nation derived of many different races seems strangely mocked."[11]
Speaking in 2008, [[Toni Morrison]], a [[Nobel Laureate]] novelist, has called Obama "a writer in my high esteem" and the book "quite extraordinary".
In an interview for [[The Daily Beast]], author [[Philip Roth]] said he had read Dreams from My Father "with great interests", and commented that he had found it "well done and very persuasive and memorable."[13] The book "may be the best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician", wrote [[Time (magazine)]] columnist [[Joe Klein]].[14] In 2008, [[The Guardian]]'s [[Rob Woodard]] wrote that Dreams from My Father "is easily the most honest, daring, and ambitious volume put out by a major US politician in the last 50 years."[15] [[Michiko Kakutani]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning critic for [[The New York Times]], described it as "the most evocative, lyrical and candid autobiography written by a future president."[16] Writing for the Guardian, literary critic [[Robert McCrum]] wrote that Obama had "executed an affecting personal memoir with grace and style, narrating an enthralling story with honesty, elegance and wit, as well as an instinctive gift for storytelling." McCrum had included the book in his list of the 100 best non-fiction books of all time.[17]
In 2011, [[Time (magazine)]] magazine listed the book on its top 100 [[Non-fiction]] books written in English since 1923.[18] The [[Audiobook]] edition earned Obama the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] in 2006.[19] Five days before [[First inauguration of Barack Obama]] in 2009, Obama secured a $500,000 advance for an abridged version of Dreams from My Father for middle-school-aged children.[20]
As early as 2004, this drew criticism from [[Chicago Sun-Times]] columnist [[Lynn Sweet]], who wrote that "it is impossible to tell who [in the book] is real and who is not."[21] Noting the book's considerable number of alterations from reality, invented composite characters, and restructured timelines, scholar [[David Garrow]] described Dreams as "a work of historical fiction" in his 2017 biography of Obama, [[Rising Star (book)]].[22][23] [[Sheila Miyoshi Jager]], a former girlfriend of Obama's, has objected being combined with another woman into a white character, as she is half-Asian and considers herself mixed-race, like Obama.[22][23]
[[David Remnick]], another Obama biographer (The Bridge, 2010), described Dreams as "a mixture of verifiable fact, recollection, recreation, invention, and artful shaping."[24] A number of factual inaccuracies or exaggerations in Dreams were also discussed by [[David Maraniss]] in his 2012 work Barack Obama: The Story; Maraniss describes the book as more akin to fictional literature than true autobiography.[25][26]
He also created [[Composite characters]] to expedite the narrative flow.[27] Some of his acquaintances have recognized themselves and acknowledged their names.
