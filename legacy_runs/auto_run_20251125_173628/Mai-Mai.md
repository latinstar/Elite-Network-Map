The term Mai-Mai or Mayi-Mayi refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) that is formed to defend local communities and territory against other armed groups.
Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and [[Rwanda]].[1] Groups that fall under the umbrella term "Mai-Mai" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads and politically motivated resistance fighters.
The name comes from the [[Swahili language]] word for water, maji.
Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] (the "[[Kivus]]"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied [[Banyamulenge]]-dominated rebel faction, the [[Congolese Rally for Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma) during the [[Second Congo War]].
While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority Batembo and [[Babembe]] ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai.
Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 [[Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement]], which was meant to end the Second Congo War, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict, and the lack of co-operation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.
A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre/Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the [[Rwanda]] military and [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma).
In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around [[Walungu]] and [[Bunyakiri]] south of [[Lake Kivu]], around [[Uvira]] and Mwenaga at the northern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], further south around [[Fizi]], and around [[Shabunda]], between the Rwandan border and Kindu.
The [[Nduma Defense of Congo]] (or Mai-Mai Sheka) was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic [[Nyanga people]].[3] Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of [[Walikale Territory]] in [[North Kivu]].[3] The NDC are accused of a [[Mass rape]] of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three-day span in [[Walikale Territory]] in 2010.[3]
A former leader of the Mai-Mai, [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]], turned himself over to [[MONUC]] troops in May 2006.
He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in [[Katanga Province]] on 6 March 2009.[4] He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the [[Mai-Mai Kata Katanga]] ("Secede Katanga").[5]
Mai-Mai Gedeon is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga.[5] The Corak Kata Katanga, also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on [[Self-determination]] for Katanga, is composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s.[5] They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011.
There was a large Mai-Mai presence in [[Maniema]], in particular around [[Kindu]] and [[Kalemie]].
[[Province Orientale]] also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.
In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two [[Wildlife officer]] in [[Virunga National Park]] and threatened to kill [[Mountain gorilla]] if the government retaliated.
From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the [[World Wildlife Foundation]].[6]
