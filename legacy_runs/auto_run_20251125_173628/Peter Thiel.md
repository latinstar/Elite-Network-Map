Peter Andreas Thiel (/tiːl/ ⓘ; born 11 October 1967) is a German and American[1][2][3][4] entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist.[5][6][7] A co-founder of [[PayPal]], [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Founders Fund]], he was the first outside investor in [[Facebook]].[8][9] According to [[Forbes]], as of May 2025, Thiel's estimated net worth stood at US$20.8 billion, making him the 103rd-richest individual in the world.[10] Thiel has been described as "perhaps America's leading public intellectual today",[11] or "intellectual architect of Silicon Valley's contemporary ethos".[12] Others debate the consistency or morality of his views.[13][N 1][15][16]
In 1971, his family moved to South Africa then [[South West Africa]],[17] before moving back to the US in 1977.[17] After graduating from Stanford, he worked as a clerk, a [[Security (finance)]] lawyer, a speechwriter, and subsequently a [[Derivative (finance)]] trader at [[Credit Suisse]].
He founded Thiel Capital Management in 1996 and co-founded PayPal with [[Max Levchin]] and [[Luke Nosek]] in 1998.
He was the [[Chief executive officer]] of PayPal until its sale to [[EBay]] in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
Following PayPal, Thiel founded [[Clarium Capital]], a [[Global macro]] [[Hedge fund]] based in San Francisco.[18] In 2003, he launched Palantir Technologies, a [[Big data]] analysis company, and has been its chairman since its inception.
In 2005, Thiel launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners [[Ken Howery]] and Luke Nosek.
He co-founded [[Valar Ventures]] in 2010, founded [[Thiel Capital]] in 2011, co-founded [[Mithril Capital]] in 2012, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at [[Y Combinator (company)]] from 2015 to 2017.[19][20][21][22] He was granted [[New Zealand nationality law]] in 2011, which later became controversial in New Zealand.
Variously described as a [[Conservative libertarian]] and democracy-skeptic [[Authoritarian]], Thiel has made substantial donations to American right-wing figures and causes.
Through the [[Thiel Foundation]], Thiel governs the grant-making bodies [[Breakout Labs]] and [[Thiel Fellowship]].
Gawker]] lawsuit ended up with Gawker losing the case, Thiel confirmed that he had funded [[Hulk Hogan]].
Peter Andreas Thiel was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Hesse]], then part of [[West Germany]], on 11 October 1967, to Klaus Friedrich Thiel and his wife Susanne Thiel.[23][24] The family emigrated to the United States when Peter was one year old and lived in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where his father worked as a [[Chemical engineer]].[5] Klaus worked for various mining companies, which created an itinerant upbringing for Thiel and his younger brother, Patrick Michael Thiel.[25] Thiel and his mother later naturalized as U.S. citizens, whereas his father did not.[24][26]
Before settling in [[Foster City, California]], in 1977, the Thiel family lived in [[South Africa]] and [[South West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]) in the time of [[Apartheid]].
He attended for two years a German-language school in [[Swakopmund]] that required students to wear uniforms and utilized [[Corporal punishment]], such as striking students' hands with a ruler.
He said this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in his support for [[Individualism]] and [[Libertarianism]].[27][28] The German community in Swakopmund was known at the time for its continued glorification of [[Nazism]].[17] Thiel was noted as a smart, but lonely, withdrawn boy, with whom others would not mingle because they knew he would not stay long in the town.[29]
Thiel played [[Dungeons & Dragons]] and was an avid reader of [[Science fiction]], with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A.
Tolkien]]'s works, stating as an adult that he had read [[The Lord of the Rings]] over ten times.[30]
Thiel excelled in [[Mathematics]] and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending [[Bowditch Middle School]] in [[Foster City]].[31] At [[San Mateo High School]], he read [[Ayn Rand]] and, influenced by his parents, admired [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].[32] He was [[Valedictorian]] of his graduating class in 1985.[31][33] When at school, he reportedly charged $500 each to take the SAT for [[Underclassman (student)]], knowing this would cost him his spot at Stanford if discovered.[32]
Thiel studied [[Philosophy]] at [[Stanford University]].
The replacement of a "[[Western Culture]]" program at Stanford with a "Culture, Ideas and Values" course that addressed diversity and [[Multiculturalism]] prompted Thiel to co-found [[The Stanford Review]], a [[Conservatism]] and [[Libertarianism]] newspaper, in 1987.
The paper received funding from [[Irving Kristol]].[34] Thiel was The Stanford Review's first [[Editor-in-chief]] until he graduated in 1989.
Thiel has maintained his relationship with the paper, consulting with staff and donating to the newspaper.[35] According to [[Marc Andreessen]], Thiel's time at the Review marked the beginning of a career-long strategy: using provocative verbal cues – later delivered through talks, books and mottos – as a way to attract capable individuals to his projects, preferring this method over actively seeking out talent.
The Review has spawned a large network of industry leaders, among whom Andrew Granato and the [[Fortune (magazine)]] respectively identify around 300 people who have worked for or received investment from Peter Thiel or [[Joe Lonsdale]], another prominent editor-in-chief and Thiel's mentee.
A number of Review alumni have also become public officials, beginning with [[Jay Bhattacharya]] and Paula M.
After graduation, Thiel attended [[Stanford Law School]], graduating in 1992 with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree.[39] While at Stanford, Thiel met [[René Girard]], whose [[Mimetic theory]] influenced him.[40][41]
After graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel was a [[Law clerk]] to Judge [[James Larry Edmondson]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] from 1992 to 1993.[42] Thiel then worked as a [[Security (finance)]] lawyer for [[Sullivan & Cromwell]] in New York.
He left the law firm in under a year.[43] He then took a job as a [[Derivative (finance)]] trader in currency options at [[Credit Suisse]] in 1993 while also working as a speechwriter for former [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]].
Upon returning to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Thiel capitalized on the [[Dot-com boom]].
Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend [[Luke Nosek]]'s unsuccessful web-based calendar project.
Soon thereafter, Nosek's friend [[Max Levchin]] described to Thiel his [[Cryptography]]-related company idea, which became their first venture called Fieldlink (later renamed [[Confinity]]) in 1998.[45][46]
Although the use of [[Credit card]] and expanding [[Cash machine]] networks provided consumers with more payment options, not all merchants had the necessary hardware to accept credit cards.
Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet for consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices, and in 1999 Confinity launched [[PayPal]].[47]
When PayPal launched at a press conference in 1999, representatives from [[Nokia]] and [[Deutsche Bank]] sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their [[PalmPilot]].
PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in 2000 with [[Elon Musk]]'s online financial services company [[X.com (bank)]], and with [[Pixo]], a company specializing in mobile commerce.
PayPal [[Initial public offering]] on 15 February 2002 and was bought by [[EBay]] for $1.5 billion in October of that year.[50] Thiel remained CEO of the company until the sale.[9] His 3.7% stake in the company was worth $55 million at the time of acquisition.[51] In Silicon Valley circles, Thiel is colloquially referred to as the "Don of the [[PayPal Mafia]]".[52]
Thiel used $10 million of his proceeds to create [[Clarium Capital Management]], a [[Global macro]] [[Hedge fund]] focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities.[53] Thiel stated that "the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium—the [[Idée fixe (psychology)]]—was the [[Hubbert peak theory]], which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives."[31]
In 2003, Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken.[54] In 2004, Thiel spoke of the [[Dot-com bubble]] having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified [[General Electric]] and [[Walmart]] as vulnerable.
Thereafter, the firm sought to profit in the long-term from its petrodollar analysis, which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies.[56] Clarium's [[Assets under management]] grew after achieving a 40.3% return in 2007 to more than $7 billion by the first quarter of 2008, but fell later in the year and again in 2009 after financial markets collapsed.[57][58] By 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, reducing the value of Clarium's assets to $350 million, two thirds of which was Thiel's money.[59]
In May 2003, Thiel incorporated Palantir Technologies, a [[Big data]] analysis company named after the [[Palantír]][60] He continues as its chairman, as of 2022.[61][62] Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that "the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism".
He also stated that, after the [[September 11 attacks]], the debate in the United States was "will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?".
According to Geoff Shullenberger (managing director of [[Compact (American magazine)]]) and Moira Weigel (Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature, Harvard), Peter Thiel and Alex Karp built Palantir on the basis of their understanding of [[Leo Strauss]] and the [[Frankfurt School]].[71][72]
After the first meeting with Zuckerberg in August 2004,  Thiel made a $500,000 [[Angel investor]] in the startup (then "a three-person dormroom") for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined Facebook's board.
He also bought Zuckerberg a car.[73][74] The investment was originally in the form of a [[Convertible note]], to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004.
Some criticized Thiel for pushing his mentee Zuckerberg and the company to the right.[77] Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook's 2007 Series D, which closed before the [[2008 financial crisis]].[78]
Facebook's [[Initial public offering]] was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million.[79] In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock-up period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion.[80] In 2016, he sold a little under 1 million of his shares for around $100 million.
On 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting and would leave after 17 years in order to support pro–[[Donald Trump]] candidates in the [[2022 United States elections]].[62][83]
In 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund.[84][18] Other partners in the fund include [[Sean Parker]], [[Ken Howery]], and [[Luke Nosek]].[85]
The fund casts [[Palantir Technologies]], [[Anduril Industries]] and the newly minted nuclear startup General Matter as the three parts of a trilogy, to which it hopes to add others, among which a plan for onshoring ultraviolet light lithography.[89]
Tolkien]] works), the fund is nicknamed "the Precious", in reference to [[The One Ring]] of Sauron.[90]
In addition to Facebook, the Founders Fund made early-stage investments in numerous startups, including [[Airbnb]],[31] Slide.com,[91] [[LinkedIn]],[31] [[Friendster]],[92] [[RapLeaf]], [[Geni.com]], [[Yammer]], [[Spotify]],[31] [[Practice Fusion]], [[MetaMed]], Vator, [[SpaceX]],[31] [[IronPort]], [[Votizen]], [[Asana (web application)]], [[Big Think]], [[CapLinked]], [[Nanotronics Imaging]], [[Powerset (company)]] (Thiel is on the board of Nanotronics and Powerset[93]), [[Stripe (company)]], Bullish Global (the parent company Block.one had also received investment from Thiel [94]), [[AltSchool]],[95] [[Trade Republic]],[96] [[PsiQuantum]] (photonic quantum computing),[97] and [[Rigetti Computing]] (superconducting quantum computing).[98] Thiel also backed [[DeepMind]], a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for £400 million.[99] Founders Fund is an important backer of the Berlin-based platform [[ResearchGate]].[100]
In 2017, Founders Fund bought about $15–20 million worth of [[Bitcoin]].
Also in 2017, Thiel was one of the first outside investors in [[Clearview AI]], a [[Facial recognition system]] technology startup that has raised concerns in the tech world and media for its risks of weaponization.[102]
In 2024, alongside [[General Catalyst]] and Red Cell Partners, the Founders Fund incubated the defense incubator Valinor Enterprises.
Anduril is a defense hardware startup that was founded in 2017 by [[Palmer Luckey]] (who is Thiel's mentee), Joe Chen, [[Trae Stephens]], Matt Grimm and Brian Schimpf (the latter three are Palantir and Founders Fund alumni).[114][115] The Founders Fund backed the company since its inception, leading its 2017 seed round.
The $1 billion (part of the $2.5 billion Series G funding round) the Founders Fund invested in Anduril in June 2025 was the largest investment in the fund's history.[116][117] In  December 2024, it was reported that Palantir and Anduril were forming a consortium of new generation defense companies (which included [[SpaceX]], [[OpenAI]], [[Scale AI]], Saronic Technologies and others) that they would lead in order to challenge the dominance of traditional defense companies.[118] In July 2025, when the Trump administration's budget bill included a provision that required border surveillance towers to be "tested and accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deliver autonomous capabilities", Edith Olmsted of [[The New Republic]] made the criticism that the government favoured Peter Thiel's business, as the provision (which only Anduril fulfilled) effectively ruled out Anduril's rivals, namely [[General Dynamics]] and the Israeli-based [[Elbit Systems]].[119][120]
Valar Ventures is an internationally focused venture firm Thiel cofounded with Andrew McCormack and James Fitzgerald in 2010.[123] Valar's portfolio includes [[Wise (company)]], reforestation-funding finance platform [[Ecosia#TreeCard]], fintech startup Atoa (Wise, Treecard and Atoa are based in London),[124][125][126] Miami-headquartered Novo and Fortú (digital bank which focuses on underbanked Latino and Hispanic communities),[127][128] fintech unicorn Qonto, fintech startup Hero, accounting automation software startup Regate (all three are Paris-based),[129][130][131] Vienna-based crypto unicorn [[Bitpanda]],[132] Lagos- and London-based banking startup [[Kuda Bank]],[133] Indonesian fintech startup Bukuwarung,[134] Nigerian banking platform Maplerad,[135] Mexican banking startup Albo,[136] banking unicorn [[N26]], B2B paytech Mondu, spend management platform Moss, tax filling unicorn Taxfix, instant payment API startup Ivy (N26, Mondu, Moss, Taxfix and Ivy are all Berlin-based; Ivy is founded by the Thiel Fellow Ferdinand Dabitz),[137][138][139][140][141][142] Dubai-based fintech startup Baraka.[143] Valar also invested in New-Zealand based companies including in the software firm [[Xero (software)]],[144] undersea communication company [[Pacific Fibre]][145] and e-reader platform [[Booktrack]].[146]
Recent investments include Arkansas-based Panacea Financial (digital fintech for medical practitioners),[147] [[Riyadh]]-based SILQ ("largest B2B commerce platform across the Gulf and South Asia", resulted from the recent merger between Bangladesh-based Shop-Up and Saudi-based Sary),[148] Canadian startup Neo (fintech),[149] London-based fertility care startup Gaia.[150]
Thiel Capital is a [[Venture capital]] fund founded by Thiel in 2011 and based in [[Los Angeles]], also referred to as Thiel's family office.[151][152] It provides "strategic and operational support" for many of Peter Thiel's initiatives and ventures.[153] It incubated and launched Founders Fund, Mithril, Valar, the Thiel Fellowship and Breakout Labs, and also sponsors Crescendo Equity Partners.[154][155]
The firm's investments include Alloy Therapeutics (with Founders Fund and 8VC),[156] EnClear Therapies (Jason Camm became a board member in 2020),[157] the German unicorn [[Atai Life Sciences]] (found by Thiel's friend, the biotech billionaire [[Christian Angermayer]]; Jason Camm also became a director in 2020),[158] [[Compass Pathways]] (also partly owned by ATAI),[159] Pilgrim (dual-use biotech startup founded by Thiel Fellow Jake Adler),[160] Hugoboom,[161] Rhea,[162] Bullish Global (Founders Fund and Angermeyer are also investors),[163] [[FTX]] (also received investment from Rivendell LLC),[164] QA Wolf,[165] Rollup (software platform to develop complex hardware),[166] Neros (military drone startup found by Thiel Fellow Soren Monroe-Anderson),[167][168] Regent Craft (electric seaglider, invested together with Founders Fund).[169] Thiel Capital is also an investor (including post-IPO financial investment as major backer) of the dual-use German laser communications startup Mynaric.
Hugoboom's app [[Evie Magazine]] requires users to input the first day of their last period to calculate the menstrual phases.
Some of the firm's notable (past) employees include former Austrian chancellor [[Sebastian Kurz]], American politician and entrepreneur [[Blake Masters]], [[Kevin Harrington (national security advisor)]] (Senior Director for Strategic Planning at the [[United States National Security Council]]) and [[Michael Kratsios]].[176][177][178][179]
Thiel Capital's investment in the Gilching-based drone startup [[Quantum-Systems]] as well as Thiel's subsequent backing of the Berlin-based attack drone startup [[STARK]]  are sometimes considered controversial, due to Thiel's politics.[180][181][182] In May 2025, Quantum-Systems became Europe's first dual-use unicorn and third defense unicorn, after fellow Bavarian startup Helsing and the Portuguese Tekever (Thiel has a role in the success of Helsing too and the startup is considered a part of the "Thiel ecosystem", although he does not directly invest in it).[183][184][185][186] Thiel's mentee Moritz Döpfner brokered the deal with Quantum-Systems on Thiel's behalf and sits on its board.
In June 2012, he launched [[Mithril Capital Management]], named after [[Mithril]] in [[The Lord of the Rings]], with [[Jim O'Neill (investor)]] and Ajay Royan.
Thiel holds shares in the space-based intelligence company [[Spaceflight Industries#BlackSky]] through Mithril.[193][194] It also invests in [[Helion Energy]].[195]
Its portfolio companies include [[Luminar Technologies]], [[Loom, Inc.]], Atom Computing and Durin Mining Technologies among others.[199][200]
Thiel is the co-founder of America's Frontier Fund, together with [[Eric Schmidt]].
[[The New York Times]] writes that, America's Frontier Fund is an organization committed to bring manufacturing back to the US, especially that of semiconductors, and the leaders are determined to carry out this mission whether the state helps them or not.[201] [[InfluenceWatch]] notes the fund's bipartisan character, with the participation of [[Ashton B.
Carter]] and [[H.R. McMaster]] and the fact that the two founders are left and right-of-center respectively.
The chief executive is [[Gilman Louie]].[202]
In December 2024, it got approval to get funding from the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technology Initiative (SBICCT), which is "a joint effort by the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]]."[203] In July 2025, it reportedly raised US$315 million for its first fund.[204]
The founders decided to bring in the US's "highest conservative circles" (which led to the formation of [[Rivada Space Networks]], which drew its personnel mainly from Kleo-Connect, in 2022), among which [[Karl Rove]] participated as an investor and lobbyist, and former US secretary of state [[Mike Pompeo]] joined the board of the mother company in the US, alongside others like [[Richard Myers]], [[Jeb Bush]], [[James Loy]], [[Charles Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank]] and the Democrat [[Martin O'Malley]].
[[Rivada Networks]]'s chairman [[Declan Ganley]] notes in particular the power of Thiel's name (whose investment in the firm remains undisclosed) in negotiation with investors.[210][211] The [[United States Department of Defense]] is also an investor.[212] [[Newt Gingrich]] is noted to have lobbied for the firm too.[213] By 2025, the "politically connected company" has already expanded to 33 countries and collected 16 billion dollars in investments, despite having not launched its satellites (deployment is set to begin in 2027 with initial tests set for 2026).[214][215] Thiel reportedly works to help the company's development, especially regarding its legal battles.[216][217][218][219]
Thiel is an investor and strategic partner of the Oslo-based SNÖ Ventures, having joined the firm in 2021, accompanied by a group of international strategic advisors.[220][221] In 2024, the fund made its first investment in the defense tech sector, an early funding for the Swedish startup Nordic Air Defence, which developed counter-drone missile technology and is staffed with former employees from Palantir and Quantum Systems.[222] Arctic Today sees this as an evidence of Sweden's strong transatlantic bond which is "seeping into defence", which is also shown in [[Daniel Ek]]'s Prima Materia's investment in [[Helsing (company)]] (which is a strategic partner of Palantir), which happened three months before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.[223]
The fund has a partnership with the Founder Fund.[224][225][226] In 2020, Thiel invested into the [[Neunkirchen, Baden-Württemberg]]-based startup Neodigital through the fund.[224][227] The fund also backs other European startups such as the London-based aggregator startup Olsam.[228] In 2022, through Elevat3 and in partnership with the Founders Fund, the Apeiron Group bought shares from the Chinese [[Fosun International]] and others to become a shareholder in the Hamburg-based [[NAGA Group]].[229] Thiel also holds shares in Heidelberger Beteiligungsholding [de] (which will be renamed as SQD.AI Strategies AG), the first dedicated German crypto holding treasury, through the firm.[230]
Seoul-based Crescendo Equity is a [[Private equity firm]] which focuses on mid-cap manufacturing and technology companies in Asia.[231][232]
According to the official website, "Crescendo was established in 2012 with the sponsorship of Peter Thiel".[233] The fund is co-founded by Peter Thiel, Matt Danzeisen (who serves as a member of its investment committee and representative to selected portfolio companies),[154] Andy Lee (company chairman), Matt Price (CEO) and Slava Zhakov (CTO).
[[General Catalyst]] is also heavily involved in its financing and organization.[234][235][236] The fund invests in Line Next (a unit of the [[Line Corporation]]), a joint venture between [[Softbank]] and [[Naver Corporation]].[237] The Business Korea credits Crescendo Equity Partners with transforming Korea's HPSP, which it invested in since 2017, into a global player in the semiconductor equipment sector.
In 2025, Crescendo initiated the sale of its 40.9% controlling equity stake in the semiconductor firm, often dubbed Korea's [[ASML Holding]].
The three major global PEF firms, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR), [[The Carlyle Group]], and [[Blackstone Inc.]], which are dubbed the "big three buyout funds", have submitted their bids.[234][238][239] The firm also plays an important role in the Korean semiconductor industry through investments and support of other companies like Hanmi Semiconductor [ko], Samyang NCchem [ko].[240] and Movensys (originally known as Soft Servo Group or Soft Motions & Robotics; the name was changed to Movensys in 2021 after Crescendo's investment).[241][242] The firm also invests in companies that make metal equipment, including Seojin System and Model Solution.[243]
The founder of the firm is [[Patri Friedman]].[245] Projects backed by the firm include [[Próspera]] in Honduras.[246] The [[Próspera]] project attracted companies like [[Oklo Inc.]] (nuclear startup backed by Thiel's Mithril[247] and Sam Altman) and biotech startups, but led to legal struggles when the new Honduran government changed the laws in 2022.[244][246]
[[Praxis (proposed city)]] is a company that seeks to establish a new city-state and has explored Greenland as a possible location.[248] In 2025, when the Danish government was integrating Palantir into the country's military, police and intelligence services, a major argument put forth by opponents was that the Praxis project  (backed by Thiel through Pronomos) was a threat to Greenland.
The [[Police of Denmark]] answered with a reference to a 2021 response to the [[Folketing]], but otherwise, the Police, the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] and Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard refused to comment on the matter.[249][250][251]
Rivendell 7 and Rivendell 25 are personal investment vehicles, which are also used to hold Palantir shares.[257][258][259] [[ProPublica]] reports that Thiel’s $1,700 PayPal investment and later investments In Palantir and Facebook through a [[Roth IRA]] had grown tax-free to over $5 billion by 2019.
According to a 2020 article from Bloomberg, Thiel was at the time an investor in funds managed by [[8VC]] and in the bank Disruptive Technology Advisers.[265] A 2017 Globe and mail article names Thiel as a limited partner at [[Social Capital]].[266] He also sponsored Sam Altman's first venture fund, Hydrazine Capital as well as J.D.Vance's Narya.[267][268] He also backs Doepfner Capital, the venture fund of Moritz Döpfner, the son of [[Mathias Döpfner]].[269][270] He funded 90% of [[Oren Zeev]] first fund and has backed it ever since.[271] The Founders Fund was also a backer of the second fund of the Indonesia-focused Intudo.
His first investment in a hedge fund managed by an outside manager was made in  2011: the firm was Grandmaster Capital Management, founded by [[Patrick Wolff]], former Clarium and [[Thiel Macro]] executive.[277] Also in 2011, he backed the second fund of   [[Joshua Kushner]]'s [[Thrive Capital]].[278][279]
In 2019, Thiel, together with [[Mark Cuban]] and [[Marc Andreessen]], backed the San Francisco-based crypto investment fund 1Confirmation.[280]
Thiel gives backing to [[Vivek Ramaswamy]]'s financial firm Strive Asset Management, also described as an activist fund.
The firm aims to free "corporate America" of what they deem to be "stakeholder capitalism" [[Environmental, social, and governance]] mandates created by the three companies [[BlackRock]], [[The Vanguard Group]] and [[State Street Corporation]] and accuse them of causing the energy crisis.
In 2021, Thiel backed the first fund of A-Star Partners, founded by [[Kevin Hartz]], former partner at Founders Fund.[283] In 2022, he backed B2B-focused Wischoff Ventures founded by solo GP Nichole Wischoff.[284]
Bloomberg comments that, "It's an unusually large investment for Thiel, the size of which hasn't been previously reported." Findley was originally an associate of Danzeisen, whom she met because she and Thiel Capital both invested in [[SoFi]].
Alexandra Ulmer and Joseph Tanfani from [[Reuters]] remark that Thiel was an instrumental force behind the creation of [[1789 Capital]], which was co-founded  in 2022 by [[Omeed Malik]] and Christopher Buskirk, a confidant of Thiel's.
In 2024, it recruited [[Donald Trump Jr.]] as a partner.[288][289]
He personally invests in [[Quora]] (leading its Series B),[290] [[Reddit]],[291] and nuclear startup [[Saltfoss Energy]].[292]
He served on [[AbCellera]]'s board from 2020 to 2024, when he resigned for personal reasons.
In March 2015, Thiel joined [[Y Combinator]] as one of 10 part-time partners.[295] In November 2017, it was reported that Y Combinator had severed its ties with Thiel.[296]
In 2024, Thiel became the lead funder of the [[Enhanced Games]], a proposed multi-sport event that will allow athletes to use [[Performance-enhancing substances]] without being subject to drug tests.[297][298] The founder is the Australian lawyer Aron D'Souza, who came to know and become Thiel's confidant in the process of leading the Gawker case for him.
In 2018, the Founders Fund invested in the [[Carbyne (company)]] (emergency service).[301]
Leaked emails (released by the hacker group Handala, which "likely operates out of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence", according to Reuters[302]) show that in 2014, [[Jeffrey Epstein]] leveraged his relationship with former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] to get access to Thiel.[301] Epstein arranged for Barak to meet Thiel in New York on June 9, 2014.
One of the people introduced to Thiel by Epstein was the Russian diplomat [[Vitaly Churkin]].[304] [[Byline Times]] suggests that Epstein was one of contact points that Thiel used for his political network in the UK, including with on the [[Labour Party (UK)]], although there is no record of Thiel's social visits to Epstein's homes or flights on his jet.[305][306]
Documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal in 2023 show that others, there were scheduled meetings (half a dozen between 2014 and 2016) betwwen Thiel and Epstein, including with others such as [[Woody Allen]] and Obama's advisor [[Kathryn Ruemmler]].
[[Reid Hoffman]], Thiel's friend from the [[PayPal Mafia]] and a big Democratic donor was the one who directly introduced Thiel to Epstein (For years Epstein acquaintances had tried to invite Thiel to meet Epstein but were rejected) and also participated.[307] Documents from the US House of Representatives showed Epstein invited him to [[Little Saint James]] in 2018.
A spokesperson for Thiel said he never visited the island.[308] In 2025, [[Snopes]] criticized a claim on the internet that Epstein offered girls to Thiel and others as misleading by omitting context.[309]
[[Euronews]] writes that there is no known major financial connection between Thiel and Epstein, but Thiel seemed to treat Epstein as a contact point.[319] [[The San Francisco Standard]] comments that around the time, other Israeli officials tried to build contact with Thiel as well, often aiming at a "lucrative" job at Palantir.[320]
In May 2016, Thiel confirmed in an interview with The New York Times that he had paid $10 million in legal expenses to finance several lawsuits brought by others, including a lawsuit by Terry Bollea ([[Hulk Hogan]]) against [[Gawker Media]] for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and infringement of personality rights after Gawker made sections of a [[Sex tape]] involving Bollea public.[321] The jury awarded Bollea $140 million, and Gawker announced it was permanently closing due to the lawsuit in August 2016.[322] Thiel referred to his financial support of Bollea's case as one of the "greater philanthropic things that I've done."[323]
Thiel said he was motivated to sue Gawker after they published a 2007 article publicly [[Outing]] him, headlined "Peter Thiel is totally gay, people." Thiel stated that Gawker articles about others, including his friends, had "ruined people's lives for no reason," and said, "It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence."[323] In response to criticism that his funding of lawsuits against Gawker could restrict the [[Freedom of the press]], Thiel cited his donations to the Committee to Protect Journalists and stated, "I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations.
On 15 August 2016, Thiel published an opinion piece in The New York Times in which he argued that his defense of online privacy went beyond Gawker.[325] He highlighted his support for the [[Intimate Privacy Protection Act]] and said that athletes and business executives have the right to stay in the closet as long as they want to.[325]
In an open letter to Thiel after losing the case, Gawker's [[Nick Denton]] accused Thiel of making them "stripped naked", together with the warning "in the next phase, you too will be subject to a dose of transparency.
Thiel is described by different authors and media sources in different ways.[329][330][331] He identifies as a [[Libertarian]].[332] He has been called an [[Ayn Rand]] libertarian,[333] plutocratic reactionary,[334] militarist techno-libertarian,[335] and [[Libertarian authoritarian]].[336] His attitude towards democracy has been described as democracy-skeptic,[16] partly antidemocratic,[337] or post-democratic.[338] French economist [[Yann Algan]] links Peter Thiel and Elon Musk to the concept of "liquid democracy" and the rise of libertarian AI governance, which Algan defines as "a radically decentralized, algorithm-driven democracy", which "prioritizes efficiency and individual freedom over democratic safeguards".[339]
Thiel's biographer Max Chafkin notes that his thinking is a mix of libertarianism and authoritarianism, but describes what Thiel truly believes and wants as a mystery.[340]
He also suggests that [[Curtis Yarvin]] methods will lead to Xi's China or Putin's Russia.[341] He does not deny the value of statemanship though,[342][N 5] but opines that   "people should spend less time trying to change the system than simply creating things outside it".[328]
Journalist Murad Ahmed from [[Financial Times]] calls Thiel "philosopher king at the very top of Silicon Valley" (with [[France 24]] using a similar description).[344][345] German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]] also remarks: "Peter Thiel can be seen as more of a philosopher king.
He acts very coolly and strategically – a dazzling figure, far outside our left-liberal perception patterns",[346] while [[Ross Douthat]] from New York Times describes him as "most influential right-wing intellectual of the last 20 years".[347] Commenting on Douthat's description, Luke Munn of the University of Queensland notes that, "Thiel's influence on politics is at once financial, technical and ideological [...] his potent cocktail of networks, money, strategy and support exerts a rightward force on the political landscape."[348]
In 2025, the author Ijoma Mangold [de] wrote an article for [[Die Zeit]], describing Thiel's theories as obscure and incoherent at first glance, but often displaying an accurate intuition, while noting that both the man and his ideas "simultaneously fascinates, repels, and outrages."[349] Later the author René Martens wrote on [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]], criticizing Mangold and Die Zeit for masking their admiration with pseudo-criticism and called Thiel a disciple of [[Carl Schmitt]].[350]
In 2009, [[The Guardian]] stated that Thiel was a member of the [[Neoconservative]], [[Reaganite]]/[[Thatcherite]] "TheVanguard.org".
On the question of exotericism versus esoteticism, Paul Leslie writes that in "The Straussian moment", Thiel tries to "weave together Schmitt's political theology—with its emphasis on the friend/enemy distinction—and [[Leo Strauss]]'s advocacy for esoteric wisdom and hidden hierarchies."[352] In the article "Exotericism and the Untroubled Race for the Future", Thiel discerns between ancient esotericism, in which "thrice-great Hermes revealed his magical recipes only to a few" and "modern esotericism of grantwriting".
He remarks, though, that exotericism takes time, and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was "perhaps [...] the last human being to command the sum total of human knowledge."[353]
Writing for the [[Quarterly Journal of Speech]] in 2024, James Rushing Daniel wrote that:[354]
According to Daniel, Thiel has financially supported the intellectual wing of "the reactionary, traditionalist turn of conservative politics" termed by some as "the [[New Right]]".[354] [[The Nation]] notes that he advocates "for a dramatic, right-wing political turn to address technological stagnation".[334]
[[Nick Land]] attributed Thiel's 2009 essay "The Education of a Libertarian" and statement that "I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible" as a watershed moment in the development of the [[Dark Enlightenment]] movement.[354] Patrick Zarrelli argues the quote is misread as anti-democratic, when Thiel's real concern is that mass democracy could erode the freedoms essential for innovation, but notes that Thiel underestimates the limits of technocracy like lack of democratic accountability.
He has built parallel governance inside the state itself.", and notes that critics call Thiel a "shadow [[Business oligarch]]".
Italian professor [[Giuliano da Empoli]] opines that Thiel represents the alliance between the post-modern Silicon Valley and the archaic Trump, that threatens democracy.
[[Blue Labour]] founder [[Maurice Glasman]] (who first met Thiel at Oxford, where Glasman rebuked Thiel's description of the [[British Empire]] as the Antichrist) denounces Thiel's view on democracy but defends leftist politicians' interaction with Thiel, saying that parties which have no place in the AI conversation will be out of the game very fast.[359] Danish politician Christopher Arzrouni [da] dismisses [[Dagbladet Information]]'s description of Thiel as a Prussian warhorse (preussisk kamphest) or a bigot tech prince who would bring the end of democracy or the world, calling him "a smart European who finds better opportunities in the U.S.", and criticizes European intellectuals' fear of new technology.[360][361]
Jacob Silverman noted that Thiel's actual political work drifted away from libertarianism, but it remained his intellectual guiding star.[362] Jack Nicastro of [[Reason (magazine)]] notes that Thiel's solution for "the dangers of government overreach and a one-world state" is "surprisingly libertarian".[363]
Thiel is a self-described [[Conservative libertarian]].[365] Since the late 2010s, he has espoused support for [[National conservatism]],[366] and criticized [[Economically liberal]] attitudes towards [[Free trade]][367] and [[Big tech]].[366]
Thiel advocates that companies should avoid competition and attention, and try to develop into monopolies by creating something new, dominate a niche market before expanding into slightly broader markets.
In The Straussian Moment, Thiel notes that, "Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of 'capitalist democracy' into an oxymoron." After the statement caused controversies, he replied that, he had made a "commonplace statistical observation about voting patterns that is often called the gender gap", and that women's right to vote was not under siege nor would taking it away solve any problem, but people should focus on projects outside of voting and politics.[332] Adam Rogers contends that this essay has prefigured the [[Department of Government Efficiency]] project.[369]
In 2021, Thiel wrote an article for [[Die Welt]], claiming that the extreme political experiments of fascism and communism in the 20th century had led Germany to fear extremism in both politics and technology.
In a 2015 conversation with [[Tyler Cowen]], Thiel claimed that innovative breakthroughs were happening in [[Computing]]/[[Information Technology]] and not the physical world.
The Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures are backers of the Hill & Valley Forum, a group that is described by the [[Wall Street Journal]] as an anti-China alliance between Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill.[372][373] In an article named Silicon soldiers of fortune, the China Daily, the channel of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party,[374] identifies Thiel, [[Palmer Luckey]] and [[Jacob Helberg]] as tech hawks who are increasingly shaping the US policy towards China.[375] The [[Xinhua News Agency]], China's official state news agency,[376] states that Palantir and its leaders like Thiel and Vice President Wendy R.
Anderson as well as other companies like Anduril and Saronic Technologies, as representatives of "the new military industrial complex", are an unpredictable danger to the US and the international community.[377] The tech-focused outlet [[36Kr]] though praises his long-term vision and methods in breaking down the traditional barriers in the US military-industrial complex and government sector, and his contribution to leading startups like Palantir, Anduril and SpaceX.[378] The Brazilian newspaper Brasil de Fato (described by [[The New York Times]] as part of a "global web of Chinese propaganda"[379]) portrays Thiel as "the brightest anti-communist in the US", part of the anti-China brigade, "the leader of the tech-based section of the military-industrial complex" as well as "the most geo-politically strategic tech billionaire" and "the most dangerous non-state figure in the world today".
According to Brasil de Fato, among all the capitalists, Thiel has the strongest grip on the [[United States National Security Council]].[380]
In 2019, Thiel called [[Google]] "seemingly treasonous" and urged a government investigation, citing Google's work with China and asking whether DeepMind or Google's senior management had been "infiltrated" by foreign intelligence agencies.[381]
In 2024, Palantir became a strategic partner of Israel in military technology in an occasion both Thiel and Karp visited the country.[384] In a 2024 interview with [[Bari Weiss]], Thiel advocated cooperation with Israel to deter Iran from getting nuclear weapons:
In 2025, writing for the Singapore-based think tank ThinkChina, Artyom Lukin, a leading Russian expert on Asia-Pacific geopolitical issues,[386] wrote that Thiel, whom Lukin described as "the [[Éminence grise]] of Trump's own deep state" and "the most anti-China figure in the US top elite", together with his allies, were pushing the American geostrategy towards focusing on China (a country Thiel saw as "a half fascist, half communist gerontocracy" with "a socialism of a nationalistic sort, and [...] extremely racist.") as the paramount threat.
According to [[The Intercept]], Thiel is the source of the warrior culture in Silicon Valley, one focused on an arms race with China, although the anti-China sentiment is found on both sides of the political spectrum.[388] [[Alex Karp]] notes that Palantir has a warrior culture, which values excellence over money.[389][390]
Thiel is a member of the Steering Committee of the [[Bilderberg Group]],[391] a gathering of intellectual figures, political leaders, and business executives,[392] characterized as focused on defense and espionage,[393] as well as Atlanticist and Europhile.[394] Thiel's outsized influence at the gathering has been noted.[395][396] Thiel, together with [[Auren Hoffman]], is also the founder of Dialog, which is often compared to Bilderberg, but focuses more on tech.
Past topics included "AI's energy demands, the future of health care, and political realignments" and "caring for aging parents, love, mental health and the afterlife."[397] Palantir is partner of the [[World Economic Forum]], but Thiel has not gone to the meeting since 2013, because he considers it a place without individuals – there are only representatives of companies, governments and NGOs. He opines that some types of global governance might work, but it is necessary to have dissenting views.[398][399]
The Thiel Foundation is a supporter of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ), which promotes the right of journalists to report the news freely without fear of reprisal.[400] Beginning in 2008, Thiel has donated over $1 million to the CPJ.[401] He is also a supporter of the [[Human Rights Foundation]], which organizes the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]].[402][403] In 2011 he was a featured speaker at the Oslo Freedom Forum, and the Thiel Foundation was one of the event's main sponsors.[403] He also backs the [[Alliance of Democracies Foundation]] founded by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].[404]
Thiel has supported mostly conservative gay rights causes such as the [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]] and [[GOProud]].[405] He invited conservative columnist and friend [[Ann Coulter]] to Homocon 2010 as a guest speaker.[406] Coulter later dedicated her 2011 book, Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America, to Thiel.[407][408] In 2012, Thiel donated $10,000 to Minnesotans United for All Families, in order to fight [[Minnesota Amendment 1]][409] that proposed to ban marriage between same-sex couples there.
In 2009, it was reported that Thiel helped fund [[James O'Keefe]]'s "Taxpayers Clearing House" video—a satirical look at the [[Wall Street bailout]].[410] O'Keefe went on to produce the [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy]]; Thiel denied involvement in the ACORN sting.[410]
In July 2012, Thiel made a $1 million donation to the [[Club for Growth]], a fiscally conservative [[501(c)(4) organization]], becoming the group's largest contributor.[411]
He is a major backer of the conservative [[Rockbridge Network]], which is now an international network with Asian branches.[412]
In 2023, [[Business Insider]] reported that Thiel became an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[Informant]] in 2021.
Business Insider also noted the fact that politicians sponsored by Thiel, including Vance and Masters, had repeatedly attacked the FBI and its leadership in public.[413][414] According to former FBI agent [[Jonathan Buma]], Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and [[David O.
He visited president of Argentina and fellow libertarian [[Javier Milei]] three times in 2024.
The Noticias de América Latina y el Caribe (NODAL) remarks that the cooperation between Thiel and Milei marks the political alignment between Argentina and Washington and Silicon Valley, also through organizations like [[Endeavor (non-profit)]].
[[Matt Stoller]], research director of [[American Economic Liberties Project]], remarks that Thiel is a "really smart nihilist", and notes that his focus is entirely on power.
Thiel is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]].[26] He contributes to both [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] and Republican candidates and causes.
In December 2007, Thiel endorsed [[Ron Paul]] for [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election]].[427] After Paul failed to secure the Republican nomination, Thiel contributed to the [[John McCain]] [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign]].[428]
In 2010, Thiel supported Republican [[Meg Whitman]] in her unsuccessful bid for the [[California gubernatorial election, 2010]].
In 2012, Thiel, along with Nosek and [[Scott Banister]], put their support behind the [[Endorse Liberty]] Super PAC.
Collectively they gave $3.9 million to Endorse Liberty, whose purpose was to promote [[Ron Paul]].[430] After Paul again failed to secure the nomination in the [[2012 United States presidential election]], Thiel contributed to the [[Mitt Romney]]/[[Paul Ryan]] [[2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign]].[428]
Thiel initially supported [[Carly Fiorina]]'s campaign during the 2016 GOP presidential primary elections.[431] After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported [[Donald Trump]] and became one of the California delegates for Trump's nomination.
He was a headline speaker during the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], during which he announced that he was proud to be gay, Republican, and American, for which the assembled Republicans cheered.[432][433] On 15 October 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016]].[434]
Thiel stated to [[The New York Times]]: "I didn't give him any money for a long time because I didn't think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to."[435] After Trump's victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the president-elect's [[First presidential transition of Donald Trump]].[436]
In 2017, [[Gavin Newsom]] (then lieutenant governor of California), whose campaign and marijuana legalization effort Thiel had supported, noted that Thiel cared deeply about criminal justice reform and had done a lot of behind-the-scene good work on marriage equality, which he was also passionate about.
By February 2022, Thiel was one of the largest donors to Republican candidates in the [[2022 United States elections]].
Two of said senatorial candidates ([[Blake Masters]] (who lost his race) and later U.S. Vice President [[JD Vance]]) were also tech investors who had previously worked for Thiel.[438][439]
In 2023, [[Barton Gellman]] of [[The Atlantic]] wrote in an article interviewing Thiel that Thiel "has lost interest in democracy" and that "he wouldn't be giving money to any politician, including Donald Trump, in the next presidential campaign".
According to [[Reuters]] this occurred after he disagreed with the Republican party's focus on cultural issues.[341][440] In the same Atlantic interview, he stated that the first Trump administration failed even his initial low expectations.[441] In 2024, he described Trump as a clown whom [[Reid Hoffman]]'s lawsuit turned into a martyr.[442] In 2025, when interviewed by [[Ross Douthat]], Thiel indicated that Trump and the populists were a disruptive factor that would prepare the stage for the process of true rebuilding (in 2023, he also opined that Trump's election would "slash regulations, crush the administrative state – before the country could rebuild").
Thiel has his own political-action committee, Free Forever, which is committed to supporting political candidates who support stricter border control, restrictive immigration policy, funds for veterans, and anti-interventionist foreign policy, among other things.[444][445] According to [[OpenSecrets]], the PAC was active only during the [[2020 United States elections]] and then only in support of Kansas attorney general [[Kris Kobach]]'s failed [[2020 United States Senate election in Kansas]].
In 2025, Brendan Glavin, director of insights for [[OpenSecrets]], remarked that Thiel's political donations have "an ideological agenda that's not strictly motivated by financial or business concerns [...] His views are libertarian generally, and he wants to elect people who are like minded."[449]
In 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (now known as the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]]), a nonprofit organization that promotes the development of [[Friendly artificial intelligence]].[452] He provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the 2007 donation drive, and as of 2013 the Thiel Foundation had donated over $1 million to the institute.[452] Additionally, he has spoken at multiple [[Singularity Summit]].[453][454][455] At the 2009 Singularity Summit, he said his greatest concern is the [[Technological singularity]] not arriving soon enough.[454]
In December 2015, [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit company aimed at the safe development of [[Artificial general intelligence]], announced that Thiel was one of its financial backers.[456]
In September 2006, Thiel announced that he would donate $3.5 million to foster [[Anti-aging]] research through the non-profit [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] foundation.[457][458] He gave the following reasons for his pledge: "Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all.
I'm backing [[Aubrey de Grey]], because I believe that his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones." As of February 2017, he had donated over $7 million to the foundation.[459]
When asked "What is the biggest achievement that you haven't achieved yet?" by the moderator of a discussion panel at the Venture Alpha West 2014 conference, Thiel said he wants to make progress in anti-aging research.[460] Thiel also said that he is registered to be [[Cryopreservation]], meaning that he would be subject to low-temperature preservation in case of his legal death in hopes that he might be successfully revived by future medical technology, and is signed up with the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].[30]
Thiel has expressed interest in the science of [[Parabiosis]], including [[Young blood transfusion]] for potential health benefits.[441][461] He said in a 2016 Inc.
article reported that the Thiel Capital medical director Jason Camm had contacted the transfusion startup Ambrosia,[462] but its founder Jesse Karmazin told TechCrunch in a 2017 article that they had never been contacted by Thiel or Thiel Capital.[463] In a 2022 [[Jacobin (magazine)]] article, Ben Burgis characterizes the blood transfusion story as part of a deliberate attempt by Thiel to portray himself as an "evil genius".[464]
On 15 April 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the newly created non-profit [[Seasteading Institute]],[465] directed by [[Patri Friedman]], whose mission is "to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems."[466][467] At one of the institute's conferences, he described [[Seasteading]] as "one of the few technological frontiers that has the promise to create a new space for human freedom."[468] In 2011, Thiel gave $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute,[469][470] but resigned from its board the same year.[471] In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, Thiel said seasteads are "not quite feasible from an engineering perspective" and "still very far in the future".[435][472]
On 29 September 2010, Thiel created the controversial Thiel Fellowship, which annually offers them a total of $100,000 (raised to $200,000 since 2025[473]) over two years to 20 people under the age of 23 in order to spur them to drop out of college and create their own ventures.[474][475][476] According to Thiel, many young people choose college simply because they're unsure of what else to do with their lives.[30] He envisions a future system that offers different paths for different people, and believes that change in the university system will require external pressure ("[[Reformation]]") before any internal willingness to adapt can arise.[477][478][479][480]
In November 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of [[Breakout Labs]], a grant-making program intended "to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government."[481][482] It offers grants of up to $350,000 to science-focused start-ups, "with no strings attached".[483][484] In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees.[482][485] In total, 12 startups received funding, for a total of $4.5 million in grants.[483] One of the first ventures to receive funding from Breakout Labs was [[3Scan]], a [[Automated tissue image analysis]] platform.[484]
Breakout Ventures is a privately held venture capital firm founded in 2016 out of [[Breakout Labs]] to invest in science.[486][487] Based in [[San Francisco, California]], it invests in early-stage companies in technology, biology, and chemistry focused on human health and sustainability.[488] The program focuses on biotech with a mix of hardware.
In 2011, Thiel made a [[New Zealand dollar]]1 million donation to an appeal fund for the casualties of the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].[500]
Thiel resided in [[San Francisco]], California, until 2018, when he moved to Los Angeles.
Thiel married his long-time partner, [[Matt Danzeisen]], in [[Vienna]], Austria, on Thiel's 50th birthday (October 2017), when he was reported to have proposed to Danzeisen.[504][441][505] Danzeisen started his career as an investment banker at [[BofA Securities]].[506] By 2007, when the couple were dating, Danzeisen was vice president of [[BlackRock]].
By 2021, he was chairman of Bridgetown 1 and Bridgetown 2, sponsored by Thiel Capital and [[Richard Li]]'s [[Pacific Century Group]].
[[Sam Altman]] also sat on the board.[507][508] Danzeisen also participates in other Thiel enterprises related to the family of [[Li Ka-shing]] (father of Richard Li), such as the Malta-based EUM.[509] In 2017 Danzeisen was working as head of private investments at Thiel Capital, with a primary focus on North America and Asia.[510][511] Thiel and Danzeisen have two young daughters, aged five and three as of June 2024, born through a surrogate.[512][513] [[Adrian Wooldridge]] from Bloomberg reported in August 2025 that Thiel had four children.[514] In 2023, in an interview with the Atlantic, Thiel noted that Danzeisen had tried to dissuade him from donating money to Republicans.[441]
Thiel was in a long-term relationship with model [[Jeff Thomas (model)]] until Thomas's suicide in March 2023.
Media coverage of Thomas's death drew widespread attention, partly because of Thomas's involvement with Democratic researchers led by [[David Brock]] and Jack Bury.[515][516] [[Puck (magazine)]] wrote that the anti-Thiel campaign exposed an undercurrent in modern politics in which there is an increasing tendency towards using people's private problems to achieve political goals.[517]
Thiel is a self-described [[Christianity]] and a promoter of [[René Girard]]'s [[Fundamental anthropology]].[518] Girard, a [[Catholic Church]], explained the role of sacrifice and the [[Scapegoat mechanism]] in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel as it offered a basis for his Christian faith without the [[Christian fundamentalism]] of his parents.[519] Thiel grew up in an [[Evangelicalism]] household but, as of 2011, described his religious beliefs as "somewhat heterodox", stating: "I believe Christianity is true but I don't sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that."[59] According to Thiel, "Christianity for me is the anti-identity.
Your identity is in Christ [...] and it's in that context we can figure out things about the world and truth [...] [Truth] is not a social construct."[520] Thiel has participated in [[Veritas Forum]] events with the theologian [[N.
Thiel opines that [[Wokeism]] or "the woke religion" is a type of secular religion, which is "in some ways [...] anti-Christian and some ways [...] hyper-Christian" and fills the void of a weakened Church because people are attached to post-Christian values rather than a "rationalist, atheist" worldview.
He notes that wokeism has a concept of the original sin as well as demands confession and repentance, while offering no transcendental values, no forgiveness or chance of redemption through sacrifice.[523][524][525][526] He claims that this strand of thinking, which attacks Christians for not doing enough for victims or the poor, is a continuation of communism and the social gospel, which also inherit some Christian characteristics while being anti-Christian at the same time.[520] [[Mikhail Minakov]] writes that "Thiel's conception of will integrates Christian eschatology, Girardian mimetic theory, and Straussian elitism to critique the impotence of liberal democracy while proposing the efficiency of a techno-feudal alternative."[524] Elke Schwarz, a professor of political theory, notes that Peter Thiel and [[Marc Andreessen]] are the foremost proponents of techno-eschatology, which demonstrates the sacralizing of AI and uses spiritualism to bolster the logic of venture capitalism.[527] Thiel opines that, "Crypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing.
A topic Thiel is interested in is the Antichrist, Armageddon and Apocalypse, about which he has given talks in multiple events, including a September 2025 series of off-the-record private lectures organized by [[David Wood (Christian apologist)]]'s [[Acts 17]] Collective in San Francisco,[529][530][531]  which drew a group of protesters.[532]  Thiel opines that different people are worried about different apocalyptic threats like environment degradation, nuclear wars or bioweapons.
He sees salvation in the figure of the Katechon, a mysterious force that restrains the Antichrist.[535][536] He has referred to individuals, organizations, communism or even anti-tech regulations as precursors of the Antichrist.[536][533][537][531] Different commentators see his Antichrist theory as a narrative to highlight the role of a hero,[530] or a framework to attack political opponents[537] or an attempt to brand himself as tech's free thinker (who has also touched on topics such as the Kennedy assassination, Epstein's crimes or aliens).[531] Kayla Carman from the Russian [[Strategic Culture Foundation]] writes that the hero Thiel describes is implied to be Thiel himself, and states that Thiel, "auditioning for a role in a cosmic drama that no one asked him to star in", will never be this savior of civilization he aspires to be and the true Katechon should be "our collective refusal to be restrained" by billionaire philosopher kings.[538] German scholar [[Adrian Daub]], Professor of German and Comparative Literature at Stanford University, describes the lectures as "amateurish talks" and a desperate effort from a man with immense power and full of contradiction to disassociate himself from his own power and even his attempts to be understood.[539] Professor Matthew Avery Sutton, representing the [[Washington State University]], notes that Thiel is sincere in his interest in Christianity and draws from serious sources, but suggests that leaders should stop dressing their political theories in apocalyptic dress, because this will "raise anxieties, delegitimize compromise and insinuate that democratic deliberation is spiritually suspect".[540]
Thiel began playing [[Chess]] at the age of six[31] and was at one time one of the top junior players in the United States.[22][541][542] He holds the title of [[Chess title#Life Master]],[543][544] but he has not competed since 2003.[26] On 30 November 2016, Thiel made the ceremonial first move in the first tiebreak game of the [[World Chess Championship 2016]] between [[Sergey Karjakin]] and [[Magnus Carlsen]].[541][545][546] He said that he stopped trying to become better at chess, because once a certain level had been reached, chess created an alternate reality that made him lose sight of the real world.[547]
Thiel is an occasional commentator on [[CNBC]], having appeared on both [[Closing Bell]] with [[Kelly Evans]], and [[Squawk Box]] with [[Becky Quick]].[548] He has been interviewed twice by [[Charlie Rose]] on [[PBS]].[549] He has also contributed articles to [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[First Things]], [[Forbes]], and [[Policy Review]], a journal formerly published by the [[Hoover Institution]], on whose board he sits.
In [[The Social Network]], Thiel was portrayed by [[Wallace Langham]].[550] He described the film as "wrong on many levels".[551] His distaste for the portrayal led to the establishment of the [[Thiel Fellowship]] on a whim.[552]
Thiel was the inspiration for the [[List of Silicon Valley characters]] character on HBO's [[Silicon Valley (TV series)]].[553] Thiel said of Gregory, "I liked him [...] I think eccentric is always better than evil".[554]
[[Jonas Lüscher]] stated in an interview with [[Basellandschaftliche Zeitung]] that he based the character Tobias Erkner in his novel Kraft ("Force") on Thiel.[555]
After he hired former Austrian chancellor [[Sebastian Kurz]] (following scandals that led to Kurz's resignation) for Thiel Capital in 2022, [[Jan Böhmermann]] of the [[ZDF]] wrote and performed the satirical song Right time to Thiel that portrayed  Thiel as a [[James Bond]] villain.[556]
Thiel was a [[German citizen]] by birth and became an [[American citizen]] by naturalization.[557] He received [[New Zealand citizenship]] in a private ceremony at the New Zealand consulate in [[Santa Monica, California]], in August 2011; his citizenship status was not made public until 2017.[558][559][560] Thiel had visited the country on four occasions prior to his application for citizenship,[561] staying a total of 12 days; the typical residency requirement is 1,350 days in five years.[562] When he applied, Thiel stated he had no intention of living in New Zealand, which is a criterion for citizenship.[563] Then-Minister of Internal Affairs [[Nathan Guy]] waived those normal requirements, under an "exceptional circumstances" clause of the [[New Zealand nationality law]].[558][561][563]
Thiel's application cited his contribution to the economy—he had founded a venture capital fund in Auckland before applying, and had invested $7 million in two local companies—as well as a $1 million donation to the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] appeal fund.[561] [[Rod Drury]], founder of [[Xero (software)]], also provided a formal reference for Thiel's application.[558] Thiel's case was cited by critics as an example of how New Zealand passports can be bought,[561][564] something the New Zealand government denied.[561] At the time that his citizenship was revealed, [[The New Zealand Herald]] came out with the report that the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service]], and the [[Government Communications and Security Bureau]] have long-standing links with Thiel's Palantir.[562]
In 2015, Thiel purchased a 193-hectare (477-acre) estate near [[Wānaka]], which fit the classification of "sensitive land" and required foreign buyers to obtain permission from New Zealand's [[Overseas Investment Office]].
In 1995, the [[Independent Institute]] published The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford, which Thiel co-authored along with fellow tech entrepreneur [[David O.
Sacks]], and with a foreword by the late [[Emory University]] historian [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]].[571] The book is critical of [[Political correctness]] and [[Multiculturalism]] in higher education and alleges that it has diluted academic rigor.
Thiel and Sacks's writings drew criticism from then-Stanford Provost [[Condoleezza Rice]] and then-Stanford President [[Gerhard Casper]] in describing Thiel and Sacks's view of Stanford as "a cartoon, not a description of our freshman curriculum",[574] and their commentary as "demagoguery, pure and simple".[575]
In spring 2012, Thiel taught the class CS 183: Startup at Stanford University.[577] Notes for the course, taken by student [[Blake Masters]], led to a book titled [[Zero to One]]: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future by Thiel and Masters, which was released in September 2014.[578][579][580]
[[Derek Thompson (journalist)]], writing for [[The Atlantic]], stated Zero to One "might be the best business book I've read".
"The Straussian Moment" is an essay written by Thiel in 2004, sometimes considered to be a fundamental text in his political thinking and was the subject of a 2019 interview at the [[Hoover Institution]].
The essay draws on several thinkers and political theorists and argues that the [[September 11 attacks]] upset "the entire political and military framework of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries", and therefore "a reexamination of the foundations of modern politics" was needed.[5]
One of Thiel's favorite books is [[The Sovereign Individual]], which was a little-known work before he helped to popularize it.[582] He wrote the preface for the reprinted edition.[583]
Thiel also has a chapter giving advice in [[Tim Ferriss]]'s [[Self-help]] book [[Tools of Titans]].
