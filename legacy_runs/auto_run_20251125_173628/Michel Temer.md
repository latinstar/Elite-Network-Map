Michel Miguel Elias Temer Lulia (Brazilian Portuguese: [miˈʃɛw miˈɡɛw eˈli.ɐs ˈtemeʁ luˈli.ɐ]; born 23 September 1940) is a Brazilian politician, lawyer and writer who served as the [[President of Brazil]] from 31 August 2016 to 1 January 2019.
He took office after the [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and removal from office of his predecessor [[Dilma Rousseff]].
He had been the [[Vice President of Brazil]] since 2011 and [[Acting president]] since 12 May 2016, when Rousseff's powers and duties were suspended pending an [[Impeachment trial]].[1]
A 2017 poll showed that Temer's administration had 7% popular approval, with 76% of respondents in favor of his resignation.[4]  Despite widespread protests, Temer refused to step down.[5] He did not stand for reelection as president in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]] and was succeeded by [[Jair Bolsonaro]].
Born in [[Tietê, São Paulo]], Temer is the son of Nakhoul "Miguel" Elias Temer Lulia and March Barbar Lulia, [[Maronite Catholic]] [[Lebanese Brazilian]] who came to Brazil in 1925.[6][7] His parents, along with three older siblings, immigrated to Brazil from [[Btaaboura]], a small village in northern [[Lebanon]], to escape [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon]] and [[Aftermath of World War I]] to [[World War I]].
Temer is not fluent in [[Arabic language]], but is able to discern the topic of a conversation in the language.[8][9][10]
As a child, Temer dreamed of becoming a [[Pianist]].
In 1957, he moved to [[São Paulo]] to finish high school in the "curso clássico", composed mainly of subjects in the humanities and languages.
In 1959, like his four older brothers he joined the [[Law School, University of São Paulo]], graduating in 1963.[13] In his freshman year, he became involved with politics by becoming a treasurer of the school's [[Students' union]].
Temer stayed neutral before the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]].[12] With the beginning of [[Brazilian military government]], he moved away from politics.
In 1974, he completed a doctorate in [[Public law]] at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]] (PUC-SP).
In 1968, Temer began teaching [[Constitutional law]] at [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]], where he also taught [[Private law]] and was director of the postgraduate department and of the Brazilian Institute Of Constitutional Law as well as a member of the Ibero-American Institute of Constitutional Law.
His most famous book is Elements of Constitutional Law, published in 1982, which sold over 240,000 copies.[14] The book focuses on the organization of the Brazilian state, especially on the [[Separation of powers]].
In his works, he showed himself to be a supporter of [[Parliamentary system]] and a [[Recall election]] system, while opposing [[Economic interventionism]] and tax increases.[15]
It consists of 120 poems, many of which were written on napkins during his plane trips between São Paulo and [[Brasília]].[15] Temer said writing poems helped him recover from the "barren arena of legislative politics".[16]
Beginning in 1987 Temer served six consecutive terms in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]],[17] and on three separate occasions served two-year terms as president of the Chamber (1997–1998, 1999–2000 and 2009–2010).[6] Temer was also a member of the 1988 [[1988 Constituent Assembly]], which [[Promulgate]] the current [[Constitution of Brazil]].[6] He became President of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB), the largest party in Brazil.[17]
Temer was the second [[Vice President of Brazil]] of Lebanese origin, after [[José Maria Alkmin]].
His family originates from the town of [[Btaaboura]] in [[Koura District]], near [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] in [[North Governorate]] [[Lebanon]].[18][19]
In 2016, he was accused of having a lobbyist bribe others between 1997 and 2001 in ethanol deals through state-run oil company [[Petrobras]].
He was also under investigation for accepting more than $1.5 million in funds from construction company [[Camargo Correa]], which works with Petrobras.
A released video made by investigators shows Rodrigo Rocha Loures, former Temer aide, carrying a suitcase filled with about $150,000 in cash allegedly being sent from [[JBS S.A.]] to the president.[23]
According to [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], Temer provided information to the U.S. Embassy in Brazil in 2006.
In 2015 and 2016, Temer was involved in controversy as [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff]] unfolded.
The letter began with the Latin proverb "[[Verba volant, scripta manent]]" (spoken words fly, written words remain).
In it, Temer speaks as if the impeachment process had already ended and he was the new [[President of Brazil]].[28] "I don't want to generate false expectations," Temer said on the recordings, which were first published by [[Folha de S.Paulo]] on 23 May.
Temer alleged it was sent incorrectly to a [[WhatsApp]] group of his party's representatives in Congress.
As investigations following [[Operation Car Wash]] grew, allegations against members of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB) began to arise.
In December 2015, impeachment proceedings toward Temer were filed, though his fellow party member, [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] [[Eduardo Cunha]], blocked the movement and instead allowed impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff.[29]
After a Supreme Court judge, Justice Mello, ruled Cunha's actions wrong, he suggested that Temer should face impeachment proceedings.[29] Another attempt to [[Impeachment proposals against Michel Temer]][30] began with the decision on 6 April 2016, by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]], [[Eduardo Cunha]], to form a commission for termination analysis of liability for crime offered by attorney Mariel M.
Cunha, who was third in line for the presidency behind Temer, faced scrutiny for alleged money laundering uncovered in [[Operation Car Wash]].[29] On 5 May 2016, Cunha was suspended as speaker of the lower house by Brazil's Supreme Court due to allegations that he attempted to intimidate members of Congress, and obstructed investigations into his alleged receipt of bribes.[32][33]
On 17 May 2016, Justice [[Marco Aurélio Mello]] allowed the impeachment request to enter the agenda of the [[Supreme Federal Court]] plenary session.[34]
Temer was awaiting a decision from the Supreme Federal Court to start an [[Impeachment proposal against Michel Temer]].
This effectively ended any chance of Temer running for a full term as president in [[2018 Brazilian general election]].[38] It can be argued that he was already ineligible to run in 2018 in any event.
Under the [[Constitution of Brazil]], the vice president becomes acting president whenever the president travels abroad.
On 30 June 2016, Temer sanctioned law 13303, which became known as Lei das Estatais ("[[State-owned enterprises]] law"), which sought to improve governance and control of Brazilian SOEs after the [[2014 Brazilian economic crisis]] of the Rousseff government, which saw [[Petrobras]] lose almost 90% of its [[Market cap]].[39][40] Under the new law, a series of measures were introduced to improve the transparency of SOEs as well as appointed council members and directors being required to have professional experience in the SOE's field.[39][41]
As acting president, he [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 5 August 2016 at the [[Maracanã Stadium]].[42]
He would serve out the balance of Rousseff's second term, which finished on 31 December 2018.[43] The vice-president position then became vacant, with the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] (at the time [[Rodrigo Maia]]) acting as the first constitutional substitute during his term.[44]
In October 2016, the [[Constitution of Brazil]] was amended by deputies[45] to cap public spending, effectively frozen for twenty years, adjusted for inflation only.
In November 2016, [[Marcelo Calero]], Temer's former [[Minister of Culture (Brazil)]], resigned, stating that Temer had pressured him to help an ally, government secretary [[Geddel Vieira Lima]], who had invested in a development that was being delayed by a heritage preservation measure by allowing construction to go ahead in spite of said measure.
In December 2016, [[Marcelo Odebrecht]] confirmed paying bribes to President Temer.[49]
In March 2017, Temer decided to move to the [[Palácio do Jaburu]] again.
He had recent problems with the Brazilian Historical Heritage Institute due to the architectural changes he made to the [[Palácio da Alvorada]].[50][51] In an interview to the Brazilian news magazine [[Veja (magazine)]] he mentioned he could not sleep in the "ample rooms" and questioned the possibility of ghosts.[52][53][54][55][56][57]
On 28 April 2017, [[Trade union]] called for a [[General strike]] against the pension and labor reforms proposed in his government,[58] which saw shutdowns of various public services in state capitals and major cities.[59] The government announces the abolition of "popular pharmacies" for the summer of 2017.
Created in 2004 under the presidency of [[Lula]], they allowed the most disadvantaged to obtain low-cost medicines.[60]
On 16 February 2018, Temer [[Decree]] aimed at tackling the organised crime element in Rio de Janeiro, transferring full control of security to the military.
On 17 May 2017, secretly taped recordings leaked by [[O Globo]], a leading national newspaper, reveal the President discussing hush money pay-offs with [[Joesley Batista]], the businessman who runs the country's biggest meat-packing firm [[JBS S.A.]],[64][65][66][67] prompting talk of trying again to impeach him.[68][69]
On Wednesday 24 May 2017, while thousands of angry demonstrators marched towards Congress demanding Temer's resignation and immediate direct presidential elections, Temer sought to suppress a revolt within his own party.[70][71]
On 9 June 2017, the Brazilian [[Superior Electoral Court]] voted 4–3 to acquit Temer and Rousseff of alleged illegal campaign funding in the 2014 election, thus allowing him to stay in office.[77][78] 
Former [[Odebrecht]] Vice President Marcio Faria da Silva said in testimony given as part of a plea bargain that Temer asked him at a meeting to arrange a $40 million payment to Temer's party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB).
Faria said he met with Temer at his law office, and that speaker of the lower house [[Eduardo Cunha]] and Congressman [[Henrique Eduardo Alves]] were also present.
On 26 June 2017, Temer was charged by Prosecutor-General [[Rodrigo Janot]] with accepting bribes and Janot delivered the charges to the [[Supreme Federal Court]].[80] The lower house was required to vote on the charges, which stemmed from allegations that he took $5 million in return for clearing up JBS tax problems and facilitating a loan.
At the time, Temer still had the support of speaker of the lower house [[Rodrigo Maia]], who possessed the power to accept or shelve a petition for impeachment.
The [[Federal Police of Brazil]] (PF), who were forced by funding restrictions to disband before all investigations into the matter were complete, had recommended that Temer also be charged with obstruction of justice.[4][80][81] [[Torquato Jardim]], who was Temer's third Justice Minister in 2017, had unsuccessfully attempted to change the leadership of the PF, and to implement a series of legislative initiatives focused on amnesty and changes to the code of criminal procedure.[82]
In June 2017 Temer's approval rating stood at 7%, the lowest for any President of Brazil in more than thirty years.[4] In a survey conducted by the [[IBOPE]] institute, between 24 and 26 July 81% of Brazilians favored the indictment of the President.[83]
On 2 August, lawmakers in the lower house in Congress voted not to refer the case against the scandal-plagued President to the supreme court, which had the power to try him.
On 21 March 2019, Temer was arrested during the investigation into [[Operation Car Wash]].[87] On March 25, a [[Habeas corpus]] was issued on behalf of Temer by [[Desembargador]] Antonio Ivan Athié.[88]
On 22 August 2017, Temer issued a decree to dissolve the "Reserva Nacional do Cobre e Associados" (Renca) [[Amazon rainforest]] reserve in Brazil's northern states of [[Pará]] and [[Amapá]], measuring 4 million hectares to allow mining by private companies and the conversion of forest into crops for agro-business companies.[89] After widespread criticism, the decree was revoked on 26 September.[90]
In an [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics]] survey in September 2016, after approximately a month of President Temer's administration, 39% of Brazilians rated his administration "bad or terrible", while 14% considered it "great or good".
A poll by [[Datafolha]] in June 2018 showed 82% of Brazilians rating his administration "bad or very bad", the most of any president since the [[Brazilian transition to democracy]].[97]
Raised by [[Maronites]] parents, Temer identifies as a [[Catholic Church]].[98]
Temer is also father to Eduardo (born in 1999 in [[London]]) with journalist Érica Ferraz.[99][100]
In 2002, Temer met [[Marcela Temer]] (born 1983), who was attending the annual political convention of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) with her uncle Geraldo, a [[Paulínia]] municipal employee.[101] They married on 26 July 2003, in a small ceremony.[102] In 2009, Marcela graduated with a law degree from Fadisp, a private school in [[São Paulo]].
