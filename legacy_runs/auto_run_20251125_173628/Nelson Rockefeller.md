Nelson Aldrich "Rocky" Rockefeller (July 8, 1908 – January 26, 1979) was the 41st [[Vice president of the United States]], serving from 1974 to 1977 under President [[Gerald Ford]].
A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]] and the wealthy [[Rockefeller family]], he was the 49th [[Governor of New York]] from 1959 to 1973.[1] He was the leader of the [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)]] of his party, known as the [[Rockefeller Republican]].
He served as [[Assistant secretary of State for American Republic Affairs]] for Presidents [[Franklin D.
Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S.
Truman]] (1944–1945), and as [[United States Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HEW) under [[Dwight D.
As governor of New York, Rockefeller's achievements included the expansion of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY), efforts to protect the environment, the construction of the [[Empire State Plaza]] in [[Albany, New York]], increased facilities and personnel for medical care, and the creation of the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].
In an agreement that was termed the [[Treaty of Fifth Avenue]], he persuaded [[Richard Nixon]] to alter the Republican Party platform just before the [[1960 Republican National Convention]].
After unsuccessfully seeking the Republican [[United States presidential nominating convention]] in [[1960 Republican Party presidential primaries]], [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]], and [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]], Rockefeller was appointed vice president of the United States by President [[Gerald Ford]] in December 1974.
Rockefeller was the second vice president appointed to the position under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], following Ford himself.
Rockefeller did not seek a full term in the 1976 election with Ford, who named [[Kansas]] Senator [[Bob Dole]] as his running mate instead of Rockefeller that year.
He served as trustee, treasurer, and president of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and founded the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] in 1954.
In the area of philanthropy, he founded the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] in 1940 with his four brothers and established the American International Association for Economic and Social Development in 1946.
Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was born on July 8, 1908, in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]].[3][4] Named Nelson Aldrich after his maternal grandfather [[Nelson W.
Aldrich]],[4] he was the second son and third child of financier and philanthropist [[John D.
Rockefeller Jr.]] and philanthropist and socialite [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]].[3][4] He had two older siblings—[[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé]] and [[John D.
Rockefeller III]]—as well as three younger brothers: [[Laurance Rockefeller]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], and [[David Rockefeller]].[5] His father, John Jr., was the only son of [[Standard Oil]] co-founder [[John D.
Rockefeller]] and schoolteacher [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller]].[6] His mother, Abby, was a daughter of Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich and Abigail P.
Rockefeller grew up in his family's homes in New York City (mainly at 10 West 54th Street), a country home in [[Pocantico Hills, New York]], and a summer home in [[Seal Harbor, Maine]].[5][8] The family also travelled widely.[9] He received his elementary, middle, and high school education at the [[New Lincoln School]] in Manhattan, an experimental school administered by Teachers College of [[Columbia University]] and funded by the Rockefeller family.[5] Rockefeller was known to disappear on the way to school and was once found exploring the city's sewer system.
Generally in the lower third of his class, he almost failed ninth grade and had undiagnosed [[Dyslexia]].
Although Rockefeller was not accepted into [[Princeton University]], he gained admission to [[Dartmouth College]],[10] arriving on campus in 1926.[11] While in college, he met [[Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller]] at the summer home in Maine, and the two fell in love.[12] They were engaged in autumn 1929.[13] In 1930, he graduated cum laude with an [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Economics]] from Dartmouth, where he was a member of [[Casque and Gauntlet]] (a senior society), [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and [[Psi Upsilon]].[14][15][16] Rockefeller and Mary were married after he graduated, on June 23, 1930, at [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]].[17]
Following his graduation, Rockefeller worked in a number of family-related businesses, including [[Chase Bank#Chase National Bank]]; [[Rockefeller Center]], Inc., joining the board of directors in 1931, serving as president, 1938–1945 and 1948–1951, and as chairman, 1945–1953 and 1956–1958; and [[Creole Petroleum Corporation]], the [[Venezuela]] subsidiary of [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], 1935–1940.[18] Rockefeller served as a member of the [[Westchester County, New York]] Board of Health from 1933 to 1953.[19] His service with Creole Petroleum led to his deep, lifelong interest in [[Latin America]] and he became fluent in the Spanish language.[20]
Roosevelt]] over [[Nazi]] influence in Latin America, the President appointed Rockefeller to the new position of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA) in the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (OCIAA).[21] Rockefeller was charged with overseeing a program of U.S. cooperation with the nations of Latin America to help raise the standard of living, to achieve better relations among the nations of the western hemisphere, and to counter rising Nazi influence in the region.[22][23] He facilitated this form of [[Cultural diplomacy]] by collaborating with the director of Latin American Relations at the [[CBS]] radio network [[Edmund A.
The Roosevelt administration encouraged Hollywood to produce films to encourage positive relations with Latin America.[25] Rockefeller required changes in the movie [[Down Argentine Way]] (1940) because it was considered offensive to Argentines.
[[Charlie Chaplin]]'s satirical [[The Great Dictator]] (1940) was banned in several countries.[26]
The conference produced the [[Act of Chapultepec]], which provided the framework for economic, social, and defense cooperation among the nations of the Americas and set the principle that an attack on one of these nations would be regarded as an attack on all and jointly resisted.
Rockefeller was a member of the U.S. delegation at the [[United Nations]] (UN) Conference on International Organization at [[San Francisco]] in 1945; this gathering marked the UN's founding.
At the Conference, there was considerable opposition to the idea of permitting, within the UN charter, the formation of regional pacts such as the [[Act of Chapultepec]].
It was hoped that the success of these companies would encourage investors in those countries to set up competing or supporting businesses and further stimulate the local economy.[34] Rockefeller established model farms in [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Brazil]].
Truman]] appointed him chairman of the International Development Advisory Board.[36] The Board was charged with developing a plan for implementing the President's [[Point Four Program]] program of providing foreign technical assistance.
Eisenhower]] asked Rockefeller to chair the President's [[Advisory Committee on Government Organization]] to recommend ways of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the executive branch of the federal government.
His recommendations also led to the creation of the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].
Rockefeller was active in [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]'s legislative program and implemented measures that added ten million people under the Social Security program.[37]
He was tasked with providing the president with advice and assistance in developing programs by which the various departments of the government could counter [[Soviet Union]] foreign policy challenges.
As part of this responsibility, he was named as the president's representative on the [[Operations Coordinating Board]], a committee of the [[United States National Security Council]].
The other members were the Undersecretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the director of the Foreign Operations Administration, and the [[CIA]] director.
Most of Rockefeller's initiatives were blocked by Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his Under Secretary, [[Herbert Hoover Jr.]], both traditionalists who resented what they perceived as outside interference from Rockefeller,[39] and by Treasury Secretary [[George M.
Humphrey]] for financial reasons.[40] In June 1955, Rockefeller convened a week-long meeting of experts from various disciplines to assess the United States position in the psychological aspects of the [[Cold War]] and develop proposals that could give the United States the initiative at the upcoming Summit Conference in [[Geneva]].
The meeting was held at the Marine Corps school at [[Quantico, Virginia]], and became known as the Quantico Study.
The Quantico panel developed a proposal called "open skies" wherein the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) would exchange blueprints of military installations and agree to mutual aerial reconnaissance.
In March 1955, Rockefeller proposed the creation of the [[2 Special Group]], a small high-level group that would plan and develop national security operations, both overt and covert.[42] The group consisted of the Undersecretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the director the [[CIA]], and special assistant Rockefeller as chairman.
The group's purpose was to oversee CIA operation and other [[Anti-Communist]] actions; however, State Department officials and CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] refused to cooperate with the group and its initiatives were stymied or ignored.[43] In September 1955, Rockefeller recommended the abolishment of the PCG, and in December of the same year he resigned as special assistant to the president.
In 1956, Rockefeller created the [[Special Studies Project]], a major seven-panel planning group directed by [[Henry Kissinger]] and funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, of which he was then president.
The report was released two months after the October 1957 launch of [[Sputnik]], and its recommendations were fully endorsed by Eisenhower in his January 1958 [[State of the Union]] address.[45] This initial contact with Kissinger was to develop into a lifelong relationship; Kissinger was later to be described as his closest intellectual associate.
In 1969, when Kissinger entered [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration, Rockefeller paid him $50,000 as a severance payment.[46]
Rockefeller resigned from the federal government in 1956 to focus on New York State and on national politics.[47] From September 1956 to April 1958, he chaired the Temporary State Commission on the Constitutional Convention.[48] That was followed by his chairmanship of the Special Legislative Committee on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution.[48] In the [[1958 New York state election]], he was elected [[Governor of New York]] by over 570,000 votes, defeating incumbent [[W.
Averell Harriman]], even though 1958 was a banner year for Democrats elsewhere in the nation.[49] Rockefeller was re-elected in the three subsequent elections in [[1962 New York gubernatorial election]], [[1966 New York gubernatorial election]], and [[1970 New York gubernatorial election]], increasing the state's role in education, environmental protection, transportation, housing, welfare, medical aid, civil rights, and the arts.
To pay for the increased government spending, Rockefeller increased taxation; for example, a sales tax was introduced in New York in 1965.[20] He resigned three years into his fourth term and began to work at the [[Commission on Critical Choices for Americans]].[50]
Rockefeller supported reform of New York's [[Abortion]] laws beginning around 1968.
The proposals supported by his administration would not have repealed the long-standing prohibition but would have expanded the exceptions allowed for the protection of the mother's health, or in circumstances of [[Fetus]].
He also oversaw the construction of the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] in Saratoga Spa State Park.[52] He supported the bill, enacted in June 1966, which acquired [[Olana State Historic Site]], home of [[Hudson River School]] artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]], as a state historic site.[53]
In addition, Rockefeller's construction programs included the US$2 billion South Mall in [[Albany, New York]], later renamed the Nelson A.
Rockefeller [[Empire State Plaza]] by Gov.
Along with the Empire State Plaza, in 1966 Rockefeller proposed the construction of the [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building]] in Harlem.
While in office he supported the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)]].[55]
He outlawed job discrimination based on sex or age; increased by nearly 50% the number of African Americans and Hispanics holding state jobs; appointed women to head the largest number of state agencies in state history; prohibited discrimination against women in education, employment, housing and credit applications; admitted the first women to the State Police; initiated affirmative action programs for women in state government; and backed New York's ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution.
He outlawed "[[Blockbusting]]" as a means of artificially depressing housing values and banned discrimination in the sale of all forms of insurance.[56]
Peterson]] to establish the [[Commission on Critical Choices for Americans]].[57] The commission was a private study project on national and international policy similar to the Special Studies Project he led 15 years earlier.[58] It was made up of a nationally representative, bipartisan group of 42 prominent Americans drawn from far-ranging fields of interest who served on a voluntary basis.
Consistent with his personal interest in design and planning, Rockefeller began expansion of the [[New York State Parks]] system and improvement of park facilities.
He persuaded voters to approve three major bond acts to raise more than $300 million for acquisition of park and forest preserve land,[60] and he built or started 55 new state parks.[61] Rockefeller initiated studies of environmental issues, such as loss of agricultural land through development—an issue now characterized as "[[Urban sprawl]]".
In September 1968, Rockefeller appointed the Temporary Study Commission on the Future of the [[Adirondack Mountains]].
This led to his introduction to the Legislature in 1971 of a bill to create the controversial [[Adirondack Park Agency]],[62] which was designed to protect the Adirondack State Park from encroaching development.
He also launched the Pure Waters Program, the first state bond issue to end water pollution; created the Department of Environmental Conservation; banned [[DDT]] and other [[Pesticide]]; and established the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]].[63]
During his 15 years as governor, Rockefeller doubled the size of the state police, established the New York State Police Academy, adopted the "[[Stop-and-frisk in New York City]]" and "[[No-knock warrant]]" laws to strengthen police powers, and authorized 228 additional state judgeships to reduce court congestion.[64] New York was the last state to have a mandatory death penalty for premeditated first degree murder.
In 1963, Rockefeller signed legislation abandoning that and establishing a two-stage trial for murder cases with punishment determined in the second stage.[65] Rockefeller was a supporter of [[Capital punishment in New York]] and oversaw 14 [[Execution]] by [[Electric chair]] as governor.[66] The last execution, that of [[Eddie Mays]] in 1963, remains to date the last execution in New York and was the last execution before [[Furman v.
Georgia]] in the Northeast.[67] Despite his personal support for capital punishment, Rockefeller signed a bill in 1965 to abolish the death penalty except in cases involving the murder of police officers.[68] Rockefeller was also a supporter of the "[[Law and order (politics)]]" platform.[69]
After four days of negotiations, Department of Correctional Services Commissioner Russell Oswald agreed to most of the inmates' demands for various reforms but refused to grant complete [[Amnesty]] to the rioters, with passage out of the country and removal of the prison's superintendent.
When negotiations stalled and the hostages appeared to be in imminent danger, Rockefeller ordered [[New York State Police]] and [[National Guard (United States)]] troops to restore order and take back the prison on September 13.
An additional eighty people were wounded in what was called "a [[Turkey shoot]]" by state prosecutor Malcolm Bell.[70]
What became known as the "[[Rockefeller drug laws]]" were a product of Rockefeller's attempt to deal with the rapid increase in narcotics addiction and related crime.
New York also provided the financial support for research in methadone maintenance and the administration of the largest [[Methadone]] maintenance program in the United States.[64]
Rockefeller was the driving force in turning the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) into the largest system of public higher education in the United States.
Rockefeller championed the acquisition of the private University of Buffalo into the SUNY system, making the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]], now the largest public university in New York.[74][75] In 1971, he championed the creation of [[Empire State College]] to provide higher education to adults by removing impediments to access such as [[Time]], location, and institutional processes.
To create more low-income housing, Rockefeller created the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC), later known as the [[Empire State Development Corporation]], with unprecedented powers to override local [[Zoning]], [[Eminent domain]], and create financing schemes to carry out desired development.
Rockefeller is criticized in some quarters for having contributed to the "[[Too big to fail]]" phenomenon in American finance in general.[77] By 1973, the Rockefeller administration had completed or started over 88,000 units of housing for limited income families and the aging.[78]
He proposed the first statewide [[Minimum wage]] law in the country; it was increased five times during his administration.
He initiated the creation or expansion of over 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of highway,[82] including the [[Long Island Expressway]], the [[Southern Tier Expressway]], the [[Adirondack Northway]], and [[Interstate 81]], which vastly improved road transportation in the state of New York.
He reformed the governance of [[New York City]]'s transportation system, creating the [[New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) in 1965.
The MTA merged the [[New York City Transit Authority]] with the publicly owned [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]], the [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Staten Island Railway]], and operation of lines that would later become [[Metro-North Railroad]], along with the newly created MTA Bus Company, which were purchased by the state from private owners in a massive public bailout of bankrupt railroads and struggling private bus companies located in Queens, New York.
In taking over control of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, Rockefeller shifted power away from [[Robert Moses]], and in doing so became the first politician to win such a battle with the master builder Moses in decades.
Under the New York MTA, toll revenue collected from the bridges and tunnels, which had previously been used to build more bridges, tunnels, and highways, now went to support [[Public transport]] operations, thus shifting costs from general state funds to the motorist.
In one controversial move, Rockefeller abandoned one of Moses's most desired projects, a [[Long Island Sound]] bridge from [[Rye, New York]], to [[Oyster Bay, New York]], in 1973 due to environmental opposition.[citation needed]
In the area of public assistance the Rockefeller administration carried out the largest state medical care program for the needy in the United States under [[Medicaid]]; achieved the first major decline in New York State's welfare rolls since World War II; required employable welfare recipients to take available jobs or job training; began the state breakfast program for children in low income areas; and established the first state loan fund for nonprofit groups to start day-care centers.[82] A supporter of [[Universal healthcare]], Rockefeller served as consultant for Senator [[Jacob Javits]]' "Medicare for All" bill that would expand benefits to every American.
Rockefeller's bid in the [[1960 Republican Party presidential primaries]] ended early when then-Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] surged ahead in the polls.
After quitting the campaign, Rockefeller backed Nixon and concentrated his efforts on introducing more moderate planks into Nixon's platform, partially succeeding in the [[Treaty of Fifth Avenue]].[citation needed]
Rockefeller, as the leader of the Republicans' [[Eastern Establishment]], began as the front-runner for the [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]] against conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona, who led the [[Conservative wing of the Republican Party (United States)]].[86][87] In 1963, a year after Rockefeller's divorce from his first wife, he married [[Margaretta "Happy" Murphy]], a divorcee with four children, which alienated many Republican married women.
The divorce was widely condemned by politicians, including Senator [[Prescott Bush]] of Connecticut, who condemned his infidelity, divorce, and remarriage.
Rockefeller finished third in the [[New Hampshire primary]] in March, behind write-in [[Henry Cabot Lodge II]] (from neighboring Massachusetts) and Goldwater.
He then endured poor showings in several more of the [[Party primaries]] before winning an upset in Oregon in May.
At a discouraging point in the 1964 California primary campaign against Goldwater, his top political aide [[Stuart Spencer (political consultant)]] called on Rockefeller to "summon that fabled nexus of money, influence, and condescension known as the Eastern Establishment.
At the Republican National Convention in San Francisco in July, Rockefeller was given five minutes to speak before the convention in defense of five amendments to the party platform put forth by the [[Moderate wing of the Republican Party (United States)]],[90] and to counter the Goldwater plank.
Rockefeller was reluctant to support Goldwater in the general election.[92] Rockefeller's [[Stump speech]] often used the phrase "the brotherhood of man, under the fatherhood of God"; reporters covering his campaign came to abbreviate the expression as BOMFOG.[93]
Rockefeller again sought the presidential nomination in the [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]].
His opponents were Nixon and Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] of California.
Shortly before the Republican convention, Rockefeller finally let it be known that he was available to be the nominee, and he sought to round up uncommitted delegates and woo reluctant Nixon delegates to his banner, armed with public opinion polls that showed him doing better among voters than either Nixon or Reagan against Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]].
Humphrey revealed in 1976 that he tried to convince Rockefeller to be his running mate in the [[Democratic Party (United States)]] ticket in 1968 but the latter refused to switch parties.[95]
Upon President Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] assumed the presidency.
On August 20, Ford nominated Rockefeller to be the next [[Vice president of the United States]].
The other two were [[Donald Rumsfeld]], the then-[[United States Ambassador to NATO]] whom Ford eventually chose as his chief of staff and later secretary of defense, and then-[[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[George H.
Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, suffering embarrassment when it was revealed he made massive gifts to senior aides, such as [[Henry Kissinger]], and used his personal fortune to finance a scurrilous biography of political opponent [[Arthur Goldberg]].[101] He had also taken debatable deductions on his federal income taxes, and ultimately agreed to pay nearly one million dollars to settle the issue but no illegalities were uncovered, and he was confirmed.
Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation anyway; nevertheless, a minority bloc (including [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Jesse Helms]], and [[Trent Lott]]) voted against him.[102] Many conservative groups campaigned against Rockefeller's nomination, including the [[National Right to Life Committee]], the [[American Conservative Union]], and others.
The [[New York Conservative Party]] also opposed his confirmation, despite the fact that [[James L.
Buckley]], its only elected member of Congress then, supported him.[103] On the [[American Left]], the likes of [[Americans for Democratic Action]] opposed Rockefeller's confirmation because it said his wealth posed too much of a conflict of interest.[104]
The [[U.S. Senate]] had given its approval December 10, 1974, 90 to 7.
The [[U.S. House]] confirmed his nomination 287 to 128 on December 19, 1974.[105] Beginning his service upon taking the oath of office on December 19, 1974, Rockefeller was the second person appointed vice president under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]—the first being Ford himself.
Ford initially said he wanted Rockefeller to chair the [[U.S. Domestic Policy Council]] but Ford's new White House staff had no intention of sharing power with the vice president and his staff.[106]
Rockefeller’s time as vice president was marked by his strong support for the [[Vietnam War]], a position that aligned him with the [[Military–industrial complex]].[108] Even as public sentiment turned against the conflict, Rockefeller remained a proponent of continued U.S. military involvement.
His unwavering stance on Vietnam reflected his broader connection to [[Elitism]], which were exposed by the [[Pentagon Papers]].[109] These documents revealed how high-ranking officials, like Rockefeller, were complicit in the escalation of the war for strategic and economic reasons, downplaying the costs to both the American people and the Vietnamese population.[110] Rockefeller’s ties to military contractors and his defense of war policies further underscored his alignment with the [[Arms industry]], which benefitted from prolonged military engagement.[111]
Ford appointed him to the Commission on the Organization of Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy, and appointed him chairman of the [[Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]], the National Commission on Productivity, the Federal Compensation Committee, and the Committee on the Right to Privacy.
While Rockefeller was vice president, the official vice-presidential residence was established at [[Number One Observatory Circle]] on the grounds of the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]].
This residence had previously been the residence of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].
Previous vice presidents had been responsible for maintaining their own homes at their own expense but the necessity of full-time [[U.S. Secret Service]] security had made this custom impractical.
Rockefeller was slow to make use of [[Air Force Two]], the official vice-presidential aircraft.
Instead, he continued to use his own [[Gulfstream Aerospace]], which had the callsign [[Executive Two]] as a private aircraft.
With the moderate Ford facing continued difficulty in securing the support of conservative Republicans for the [[1976 Republican Party presidential primaries]] and anticipating a challenge from the conservative [[Ronald Reagan]], he considered the possibility of another running mate, and discussed it with Rockefeller.
In explaining his decision, Rockefeller said that he "didn't come down [to Washington] to get caught up in party squabbles which only make it more difficult for the President in a very difficult time".[113][114] After Ford was nominated at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]], Reagan, Goldwater, and other prominent conservatives conditioned their support for Ford on his selection of a suitable vice-presidential nominee.
Ford selected Kansas Senator [[Bob Dole]] instead.
Rockefeller campaigned actively for the Republican ticket in the [[1976 United States presidential election]], which was won by [[Jimmy Carter]].
In what would become an iconic photo of the 1976 campaign, Rockefeller appeared to be responding to hecklers at a rally in [[Binghamton, New York]], with a [[Raised middle finger]].[117] Rockefeller's former right-hand man [[Malcolm Wilson (governor)]] told reporter Richard Zander that Rockefeller "just got his fingers mixed up" while signaling somebody.[118] While political observers scoffed at that explanation, it may have been true; Rockefeller had [[Dyslexia]] and was known to favor his middle finger, signing his signature with a pen held between his index and middle fingers.
Writing about the moment 20 years later, Michael Oricchio of the [[San Jose Mercury News]] said the action became known euphemistically as "the Rockefeller gesture".[117]
Rather, he considered himself a practical problem solver, much more interested in defining problems and finding solutions around which he could unite support sufficient to ensure their enactment in legislation than in following either a strictly [[Modern liberalism in the United States]] or strictly [[Conservatism in the United States]] course.
Dewey]], a moderate Republican who was more [[Fiscally conservative]].[120][121] Rockefeller expanded the state's [[Infrastructure]], increased spending on education including a massive expansion of the State University of New York, and increased the state's involvement in environmental issues.
In foreign affairs, Rockefeller supported American involvement in the [[United Nations]], as well as United States foreign aid.
He also supported the fight against [[Communism]] and its membership in [[NATO]].
As a result of Rockefeller's policies, some conservatives sought to gain leverage by creating the [[Conservative Party of New York]].
The small party acted as a minor counterweight to the [[Liberal Party of New York]].[122]
In 1940, he and his four brothers established the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], a philanthropy; he served as a trustee from 1940 to 1975 and 1977 to 1979, and as president in 1956.
Rockefeller served as a trustee of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from 1932 to 1979.
In 1933 Rockefeller was a member of the committee selecting art for the new [[Rockefeller Center]].
For the wall opposite the main entrance of 30 Rockefeller Plaza Nelson Rockefeller wanted [[Henri Matisse]] or [[Pablo Picasso]] to paint a mural because he favored their [[Modern art]] but neither was available.
[[Diego Rivera]] was one of Rockefeller's mother's favorite artists and therefore was commissioned to create the huge mural.
The sketch featured an anonymous man at the center; however, when it was painted, the work caused great controversy due to the inclusion of a painting of [[Vladimir Lenin]] (depicting [[Communism]]) just off-center.[127] The directors of Rockefeller Center objected and Rockefeller asked Rivera to change the face of Lenin to that of an unknown laborer's face as was originally intended but the painter refused.
At Rockefeller Center in its place is a mural by Jose Maria Sert which includes an image of [[Abraham Lincoln]].
The Rockefeller-Rivera dispute is covered in the films [[Cradle Will Rock]] and [[Frida (2002 film)]].[citation needed]
He continued his mother's work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] as president and turned the basement of his [[Kykuit]] mansion into a gallery while placing works of sculpture around the grounds (an activity he enjoyed personally supervising, frequently moving the pieces from place to place by helicopter).
While he was overseeing construction of the State University of New York system, Rockefeller built, in collaboration with his lifelong friend [[Roy Neuberger]], the [[Philip Johnson]]-designed Neuberger Museum on the campus of the [[State University of New York at Purchase]].
He commissioned Master [[Santiago Martínez Delgado]] to make a canvas mural for the Bank of New York (City Bank) in [[Bogotá]], Colombia; this ended up being the last work of the artist, as he died while finishing it.[citation needed]
In 1954, he established the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] devoted to the indigenous art of the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and early Asia and Europe.
In 1956, [[Frederic Huntington Douglas]] was named honorary Curator of the American Indian section of the Nelson Rockefeller Museum of Native Arts in New York.[129] The museum opened to the public in 1957 in a townhouse at [[15 West 54th Street]] in New York City.
In 1969, he gave the museum's collection to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] where it became the Michael C.
Rockefeller, impressed with the work of photographer [[Lee Boltin]] and editor/publisher Paul Anbinder on the book, co-founded Nelson Rockefeller Publications, Inc.
On June 23, 1930, Rockefeller married [[Mary Rockefeller]], a daughter of [[Percy Hamilton Clark]], a noted cricketer, and Elizabeth Williams Clark (née Roberts), of [[Germantown, Philadelphia]].
On May 4, 1963, Rockefeller married [[Happy Rockefeller]].
With Mary Rockefeller, Rockefeller had lived at the three top floors at [[810 Fifth Avenue]].
Ellen Harrison, the wife of Wally Harrison, the architect and Rockefeller confidant, claimed that Malinda's parentage was an open secret among Rockefeller associates.[144] Rockefeller was also a patient of famous psychic [[Edgar Cayce]].[145]
An initial report incorrectly stated that he died at his desk in his office at [[Rockefeller Center]].[148][149] The report was soon corrected to state that Rockefeller actually had the fatal heart attack at another location, a townhouse he owned at [[13 West 54th Street]].[150] The heart attack occurred in the late evening in the presence of [[Megan Marshack]], a 25-year-old aide.[151] After Rockefeller suffered the heart attack, Marshack called her friend, news reporter [[Ponchitta Pierce]], to the townhouse; Pierce phoned an ambulance approximately an hour after the heart attack.[152]
Rockefeller's remains were [[Cremated]] at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in nearby [[Hartsdale, New York]].
On January 29, 1979, family and close friends gathered to inter his ashes in the private Rockefeller family cemetery in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].[153] A memorial service was held at [[Riverside Church]] in [[Upper Manhattan]] on February 2; the service was attended by 2,200 people.
Attendees included President [[Jimmy Carter]] and former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]].[154]
The circumstances of Rockefeller's death led to widespread speculation regarding a possible adulterous relationship between Rockefeller and [[Megan Marshack]].[155][156][157] Marshack had worked for Rockefeller when he served as vice president, had relocated to New York, had continued to work for Rockefeller after his term as vice president ended, and had received financial assistance from Rockefeller in purchasing and furnishing a condominium several doors down from his Manhattan townhouse.[156] In a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) documentary about the Rockefeller family, longtime Rockefeller aide [[Joseph E.
Persico]] said: "It became known that [Rockefeller] had been alone with a young woman who worked for him, in undeniably intimate circumstances, and in the course of that evening had died from a heart attack."[158] Rockefeller's four oldest children issued a statement saying that they had conducted their own review, that they believed their father could not have been saved, and that all those who tried to help had acted responsibly.[159] The family would not consent to an [[Autopsy]].[160]
In 2017, the [[New York Daily News]] stated that following Rockefeller's death, "it wasn't long before [[Johnny Carson]] could start drawing laughs merely by uttering the words 'Megan Marshack.'"[156]
