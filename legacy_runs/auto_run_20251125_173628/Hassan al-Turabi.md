Hassan al-Turabi ([[Arabic language]]: حسن الترابي, [[Romanization of Arabic]]: Ḥasan al-Turābī; 1 February 1932 – 5 March 2016) was a Sudanese politician and scholar.
He was the alleged architect of the [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état]] that overthrew [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] and installed [[Omar al-Bashir]] as [[President of Sudan]].[1][2] He has been called "one of the most influential figures in modern [[Politics of Sudan]]"[3] and a "longtime hard-line ideological leader".[4] He was instrumental in institutionalizing [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) in the northern part of the country and was frequently imprisoned in [[Sudan]], but these "periods of detention" were "interspersed with periods of high political office".[5]
al-Turabi was leader of the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) (which later changed its name to [[National Congress Party (Sudan)]] in the late 1990s[6]), a political movement that developed considerable political power in Sudan while never obtaining significant popularity among Sudanese voters.
It embraced a "top down" approach to [[Islamisation]] by placing party members in high posts in government and security services.
al-Turabi and the NIF reached the peak of their power from 1989 following a military coup d'état, until 2001, as what [[Human Rights Watch]] have called "the power behind the throne",[7] head of the first [[Sunni Islam]] movement to take control of a state.[8]
al-Turabi oversaw highly controversial policies such as the creation of the "NIF police state" and associated NIF militias that consolidated Islamist power and prevented a popular uprising, but according to Human Rights Watch committed many human rights abuses, including "[[Summary execution]], [[Torture]], ill treatment, [[Arbitrary arrest and detention]], denial of freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion, and violations of the rules of war, particularly in the south".[7] Turabi was a leader of opposition to the [[Coalition of the Gulf War]] in the [[Gulf War]], establishing in 1990–1991 the [[Popular Arab and Islamic Congress]] (PAIC), a regional umbrella for political Islamist militants, headquartered in [[Khartoum]].[7]
After 1996, al-Turabi and his party's "internationalist and ideological wing" saw a decline in influence in favor of more pragmatic leaders, brought on by the imposition of UN sanctions on Sudan in punishment for Sudan's assistance to [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in their attempt to assassinate [[President of Egypt]] [[Hosni Mubarak]].
al-Turabi was out of power beginning in 1999, leading a splinter group of the National Congress known as the [[Popular Congress Party]].[9] He was imprisoned by Omar Al-Bashir on 17 January 2011 for nine days, following [[Arab Spring]] across the [[Arab world]].[9][10] He died in 2016 without facing trial for his role in the 1989 coup.[1]
al-Turabi was born on 1 February 1932 in [[Kassala]],[11] eastern Sudan, to a [[Sufi]] [[Muslims]] sheikh, and received an Islamic education,[12] before coming to [[Khartoum]] in 1951 to study law and joined the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as a student.[13] He graduated from Khartoum University School of Law in 1955 and also studied in [[London]] and at the [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]] in 1962, where he gained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]].[12] He became a leader of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1960s.[7] He is a descendant of a famous 17th-century religious sheikh, Hamad al-Turabi.
Turabi's writings, rhetoric, sermons, and public pronouncements have often been described as [[Progressivism]], [[Liberal theology]],[14] "moderate and thoughtful",[3] but his time in power was notable for harsh [[Human rights in Sudan]].[14] The diplomat [[Andrew Natsios]] explained these contradictions by claiming that he took more moderate positions when being interviewed by [[English language]] and [[French language]]-speaking interviewers when compared to his speeches to his fellow [[Islamism]].[3]
al-Turabi's philosophy drew selectively from Sudanese, Islamic, and Western political thought to fashion an ideology for the pursuit of power.[15] al-Turabi supported Sharia and the concept of an Islamic state, but his vision was not [[Wahhabism]] or [[Salafi movement]].[15] He appreciated that the majority of Sudanese followed [[Sufism]] Islam, which he set out to change with new ideas.[15] He did not extend legitimacy to Sufis, [[Mahdi]], and Islamic scholars, whom he saw as incapable of addressing the challenges of modern life.[15] One of the strengths of his vision was to consider different trends in Islam.[15] Although the political base for his ideas was probably relatively small, he had an important influence on Sudanese politics and religion.[15]
His views on the role of women in society were relatively progressive.[15] al-Turabi had his greatest success in recruiting supporters from the educated and professional classes in urban areas.[15] He attached fundamental importance to the concept of [[Shura]] (consultation) and ibtila, his view of modernity, which he believed should lead to a more profound worship of [[God in Islam]].[15] Religion was regularly tested by the reality of ibtila.[15]
As a [[Sunni]] Islamist, Turabi's ideas differed in some ways from traditional Islamic ideas, such as in his lack of reverence for professional Islamic scholars.
Rather than the [[Ulama]] (class of Islamic scholars) being restricted to educated Islamic scholars, he stated that "because all knowledge is divine and religious, a chemist, an engineer, an economist or a jurist are all ulamas." In fact, in an Islamic democracy, which Turabi maintained he was working towards,
ideally there is no clerical [[Ulama]] class, which prevents an elitist or [[Theocratic]] government.
Whether termed a religious, a theocratic, or even a [[Secular]] theocracy, an Islamic state is not a government of the ulama.[16][17]
During an interview on al-Arabiya TV in 2006, al-Turabi describes the word [[Hijab]] as not a face veil but a cover or diaphragm put in a room to separate between men and the Prophet's wives, whereas [[Niqab]] is just an old Arab habit.
The Prophet's wives sat behind it when talking to males because they were not allowed to show their faces.[19] He opposed the death penalty for [[Apostasy in Islam]] and opposed [[Satanic Verses controversy]] against [[Salman Rushdie]].
al-Turabi also laid out his vision for [[Sharia]] law that would be applied gradually instead of forcefully and would apply only to Muslims, who would share power with the [[Christians]] in a [[Federation]] system.[citation needed]
one of the pieces of national legislation he pressed for was that [[Apostasy in Islam]] be punished by the death penalty, a position he has since disavowed.
In 2006, out-of-power again, al-Turabi made international headlines issuing a [[Fatwa]] allowing Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men, and allowing alcohol consumption in certain situations, in contradiction to historical [[Sharia]] law.[22][23][24][25] He also embraced human rights and democracy in "a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn" of his views.[26] One critic of Turabi complained to an American journalist in Khartoum of Turabi's ideological reversal, saying, "it is said in the daily papers and in the discussion centers here in the university that Turabi killed Ustazh Mahmoud", (i.e. liberal Sudanese cleric [[Mahmoud Mohammed Taha]], hanged in 1985), "and now he’s stealing his ideas."[26]
Early in his career, al-Turabi took control of Islamic Liberation Movement under the name of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood.[15] In 1964 he became secretary-general of the [[Islamic Charter Front]] (ICF), an activist movement that served as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected to parliament in the mid-1960s.[15] He headed the Front of the Islamic Pact and the Party of the Islamic Bloc from 1964 50 1969.[15] Following the [[History of Sudan]], [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] jailed al-Turabi for seven years.[15] Released in 1977, al-Turabi became [[Attorney General of Sudan]] in 1979 and then Nimeiry’s foreign affairs adviser in 1983.[15] Nimeiry put him back in prison in 1985; the new military government released him later the same year.[15] al-Turabi established the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) in 1985 as a replacement for the ICF.[15] al-Turabi held several ministerial positions in government of the democratically elected [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], which the NIF joined in 1988 as a coalition partner, but he was never comfortable with this arrangement.[15]
On 30 June 1989, [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état]] by General [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]] began a process of severe repression, including purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.[27] From 1989 until 2001, Turabi served as what observers have called the "intellectual architect",[28] or "the power behind the throne",[7] sometimes officially as leader of the NIF and sometimes as speaker of the parliamentary assembly.[7]
While there is a "pervasive belief" in Sudan that Turabi and the NIF actively collaborated with the coup-makers who called themselves the "[[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]]", in fact the RCC-NS banned all political parties following the 1989 coup and arrested Turabi, as well as the leaders of other political parties, and held him in solitary confinement for several months.[2] Before long however, NIF influence within the government was evident in its policies and in the presence of several NIF members in the cabinet.[2]
Alleged human rights abuses by the NIF regime included [[War crime]], [[Ethnic cleansing]], a revival of [[Slavery]], [[Torture]] of opponents, and an unprecedented number of refugees fleeing into [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Eritrea]], [[Egypt]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]].[29]
In 1994 a report issued by [[Human Rights Watch]]/Africa, conducted by Gáspár Bíró, a Hungarian law professor and the United Nations' special envoy to Sudan in 1993 found the Sudanese government to be practicing "widespread and systematic torture" of political detainees.
On 26 May 1992 al-Turabi was attacked at the [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport]] in [[Canada]] by Sudanese [[Karate]] [[Black belt (martial arts)]] master, Hashim Bedreddin Mohammed.
He attacked al-Turabi by using two [[Knifehand strike]] to knock down Turabi, whose head struck the pavement[31] putting him into a coma.
Hashim was a [[Sufi]] in exile and an opponent of the National Islamic Front Islamist regime in Sudan and had won a karate world championship in 1983.
A [[Somalis]] man pushed Hashim away with a trolley which weakened the blow that could have otherwise killed al-Turabi.[32] al-Turabi was hospitalized for 4 weeks with constant black outs.[33] After al-Turabi was knocked out, Hashim assumed he was dead and departed.
[[Al-Qaeda]]'s leader [[Osama bin Laden]] moved his base of operations from [[Saudi Arabia]] to Sudan around 1991 reportedly at the personal invitation of al-Turabi, and stayed until 1996 when he moved to [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)]].
Bin Laden moved to Sudan after conflict with the Saudi government over their granting of permission to the United States to station troops in Saudi Arabia during the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]].
Bin Laden believed he should lead the fight against Saddam using [[Afghan Arabs]] forces.
al-Turabi granted bin Laden a safe place from which to conduct jihadist activities; in return, bin Laden agreed to help the Sudanese government in roadbuilding and to fight [[Animist]] and [[Christians]] separatists in [[South Sudan]].
Other violent groups al-Turabi invited and allowed to operate freely included [[Abu Nidal Organization]], (which reportedly had killed more than 900 people in 20 different countries) [[Hezbollah]], and [[Carlos the Jackal]], (posing as a French arms dealer at the time).
Carlos had converted from [[Marxism]] to [[Islamic extremism]].[37] (Sudanese sanctuary was not unconditional as it later allowed French intelligence to kidnap Carlos the Jackal while he was undergoing an operation on his right testicle.")[38]
al-Turabi founded the [[Popular Arab and Islamic Congress]] in 1990–1991.
Meeting here were several Islamic groups from around the world, including representatives from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Hamas]], the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], the Algerian Islamic Jihad, and [[Hezbollah]].
In late 1991 or 1992 al-Turabi sought to persuade [[Shia Islam]] and Sunnis to put aside their divisions and join against the common enemy.
In August 1993, Sudan was placed on the United States' list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)]] following the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] in February.
The [[U.S. State Department]] notes that "five of 15 suspects arrested" following the bombing were Sudanese.[39]
Two years later an assassination attempt was made on then Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] by [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization, many of whose members were living in exile in Sudan.[40] Evidence from the Egyptian and Ethiopian governments implicated the Sudanese government[40][41][42]
The Sudanese representative denied the charges, but the Sudanese delegation was already in disfavor, having been implicated only two years earlier in a plot to blow up [[UN headquarters]].[42]
In March 1996, [[1996 Sudanese general election]] were held for the first time since the coup,[45] and al-Turabi was elected to a seat in the [[National Assembly (Sudan)]], where he served as speaker during the 1990s.[4] This was his first instance of holding a political position with some consistency.[citation needed] During the "last few years of the 1990s", his influence and that of his party's "'internationalist' and ideological wing" waned "in favor of the 'nationalist' or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan's disastrous international isolation and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism".[46]
After a political falling out with President [[Omar al-Bashir]] in 1999,[47] al-Turabi was imprisoned based on allegations of conspiracy before being released in October 2003.[48] Arrested again in 2004 for allegedly being part of a plot to overthrow the government,[49] he was released on 28 June 2005.
In 2004 he was reported to have been associated with the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM), an [[Islamist]] armed rebel group involved in the [[War in Darfur]], whose leader, [[Khalil Ibrahim]], was previously a follower of Mr. al-Turabi.[50] al-Turabi himself has denied any association.
Turabi spent 16 months in prison from 2004 until 28 June 2005, during which time he spent several weeks on a [[Hunger strike]].[50]
After the JEM [[2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum]][51] on 10 May 2008,[52] al-Turabi was arrested on the morning of 12 May 2008, along with other members of his Popular Congress Party (PCP).
He said that he had expected the arrest, which occurred while he was returning to Khartoum from a PCP gathering in [[Sennar]].[48] He was questioned and released without charge[53] later in the day, after about 12 hours in detention.[54]
Presidential advisor [[Mustafa Osman Ismail]] said that al-Turabi's name had been found on JEM documents,[54] but he denied that al-Turabi had been arrested, asserting that he had merely been "summoned" for questioning.
al-Turabi, however, said that it was an arrest and that he had been held at [[Kobar Prison]].[48] According to al-Turabi, he was questioned regarding the relationship between the PCP and JEM, but he did not answer this question,[51] although he denied that there was a relationship after his release;[48] he also said that he was asked why he did not condemn the rebel attack.[54] He said that the security officers questioning him had "terrified" him[51] and that, although they claimed to have proof against him, they did not show him this proof when he asked to see it.[48]
[[Salva Kiir Mayardit]], the First Vice-President of Sudan and President of the Government of Southern Sudan, said that there had been no discussion about arresting al-Turabi at a presidency meeting on the previous day and that there was no security report implicating him.
He alleged that al-Turabi was being used as a [[Scapegoat]].[52]
In an interview on 17 May 2008, al-Turabi described the JEM's attack on Khartoum as "positive" and said that there was "so much misery in [[Darfur]], genocidal measures actually".
On 12 January 2009, al-Turabi called on Bashir to surrender himself to the [[International Criminal Court]] for the sake of the country, while holding Bashir politically responsible for war crimes in Darfur.[55] (He later changed his position and opposed Bashir turning himself in.[56]) He was then arrested on 14 January[55][57] and held in prison for two months (until 8 March)[58] at the [[Kobar Prison]] before being moved to [[Port Sudan]] prison.[59] During this time members of his family expressed concern about his health and his being held in [[Solitary confinement]] at least some of the time.[57] [[Amnesty International]] also released a statement about al-Turabi's arrest on 16 January, describing it as "arbitrary" and politically motivated.
On 8 March, he was released only days after the [[International Criminal Court]] issued an arrest warrant against [[Omar al-Bashir]].[61] On 11 April 2009, the PCP called for the creation of a transitional government to lead Sudan to the planned [[2010 Sudanese general election]], and al-Turabi suggested that he would not stand as a candidate due to his advanced age; he emphasized the importance of leadership coming from younger generations and said that he did not have enough energy to run.[62] In April al-Turabi was stopped at [[Khartoum International Airport]] and prevented from travelling to Paris for medical tests despite having obtained permission to travel from the interior ministry.[58]
al-Turabi announced on 2 January 2010 that the PCP had designated his deputy, [[Abdallah Deng Nhial]], as its candidate for the 2010 presidential election.[63] al-Turabi was again arrested in mid May 2010, but was released on 1 July 2010.[64]
On 18 January 2011, security forces arrested al-Turabi in [[Khartoum]], presumably due to the recent instability of [[Politics of Sudan]].
He added that the government should take lessons from the recent [[Tunisian Revolution]].[65]
