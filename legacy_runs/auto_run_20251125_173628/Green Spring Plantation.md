Green Spring Plantation in [[James City County, Virginia]] about five miles (8.0 km) west of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], was the 17th century [[Plantations in the American South]] of one of the most unpopular governors of [[Virginia Colony]] in North America, Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)]], and his wife, [[Frances Culpeper Berkeley]].
Contrary to popular belief the well-known [[Berkeley Plantation]] in nearby [[Charles City County, Virginia]] was not named in his honor.
Today, a section of the land that formed the core of Green Spring Plantation is part of the [[Colonial National Historical Park]].
It also lends its name to the section of the multi-use [[Virginia Capital Trail]] that extends from Governor Berkeley's capital at Jamestown, past many former great plantations (including Berkeley plantation) to the current state capital at Richmond, Virginia.
The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States]] at Green Spring was built in 1645.
The plantation originally encompassed a 2,090-acre (850 ha) experimental [[Farm]].
Seeking alternative export products to supplement [[Tobacco]], which had become the Colony's mainstay, Green Spring produced flax, [[Fruit]], [[Potash]], [[Rice]], [[Silk]], and spirits, which were shipped to markets in North America, the [[West Indies]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Holland]].
When Berkeley's widow Lady Frances married [[Philip Ludwell]], ownership passed to him, and then to his son Philip Ludwell II and grandson [[Philip Ludwell III]].
Green Spring Plantation witnessed many historic events, including the beginnings of [[Slavery]] in Virginia, [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in 1676, the [[Battle of Green Spring]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1781, and the emancipation of its slaves in 1804, by the will of William Ludwell Lee,[4] son of [[William Lee (diplomat)]].
In 1862, the property was also involved in the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]].
In the 21st century, about 200 acres (81 ha) of the original plantation are preserved by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) as part of the [[Colonial National Historical Park]], which acquired the property in 1966.
The site includes [[Archeology]] and architectural remnants of the manor house and ancillary structures.
It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 29, 1978.
