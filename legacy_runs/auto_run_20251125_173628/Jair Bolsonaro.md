Jair Messias Bolsonaro (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʒaˈiʁ meˈsi.ɐz bowsoˈnaɾu] ⓘ; born 21 March 1955) is a Brazilian politician and former military officer who served as the 38th [[President of Brazil]] from 2019 to 2023.
He previously served as a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] from 1991 to 2019.
Born in [[Glicério]], São Paulo, Bolsonaro began serving in the [[Brazilian Army]] in 1973 and graduated from the [[Military Academy of Agulhas Negras]] in 1977.[1] He attracted publicity in 1986 after he wrote an article for [[Veja (magazine)]] magazine criticizing the low wages of military officers, after which he was arrested and detained for fifteen days.
He left the army and was elected to the [[Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro]] two years later.
In 1990 he was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative for the [[State of Rio de Janeiro]].
During his 27-year tenure as a congressman he became known for his [[National conservatism]].
Bolsonaro entered the [[2018 Brazilian presidential election]], during which he began advocating [[Economically liberal]] and pro-market policies.[2] After surviving [[Attempted assassination of Jair Bolsonaro]] on 6 September, he led in the 7 October first-round results and defeated [[Fernando Haddad]] in the 28 October runoff.
Bolsonaro focused on domestic affairs in his first months as president, dealing primarily with the fallout of the [[2014 Brazilian economic crisis]].
The economy recovered slowly, while crime rates fell sharply during the first year.[3][4] He rolled back protections for [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]][5] and facilitated its [[Deforestation in Brazil]].[6] Bolsonaro's response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil]] was criticized across the political spectrum after he sought to downplay the pandemic and its effects, opposed quarantine measures, and dismissed two health ministers, while the death toll increased rapidly.[7]
A polarizing politician, Bolsonaro has drawn both praise and criticism in Brazil for his views and comments, which have been described as [[Far-right]] and [[Populist]].[8][9][10][11] He is a vocal opponent of [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil]],[12][13] [[Abortion in Brazil]],[14] [[Affirmative action]],[15] [[Drug liberalization]], and [[Secularism]].[16] In foreign policy he has advocated closer relations [[Brazil–Israel relations]] and [[Brazil–United States relations]];[17][18] later in his presidency he also made efforts to improve relations with the [[BRICS]] countries.[19][20]
In the [[2022 Brazilian general election]] Bolsonaro lost to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].[21] On 8 January 2023 a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters [[8 January Brasília attacks]], calling for a [[Coup d'état]].
On 30 June the [[Superior Electoral Court]] blocked Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for attempting to undermine the validity of the election through his unfounded claims of voter fraud, and for abusing his power by using government communication channels to both promote his campaign and to allege fraud.
Testimony from military officials showed that Bolsonaro had [[2022 Brazilian coup plot]] with the military to keep himself in power.[22]
In November 2024 he [[Operation Counter-coup]] by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]] of multiple crimes related to the planned coup.[23] He was charged in February 2025,[24] and the Supreme Court ruled he must stand trial.[25] On 4 August 2025 he was placed under [[House arrest]] for using a mobile phone and accessing social media via his son [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]],[26] violating pre-trial rules.[27] His trial began on 2 September; on 11 September he was found guilty by the [[Supreme Federal Court]] and [[AP 2668]] in prison.[28][29] On November 22, 2025, Bolsonaro was arrested by the federal police after trying to remove his eletronic ankle monitor.[30][31][32] Two days later, the Supreme Federal Court unanimously voted to keep Bolsonaro in police custody.[33][34]
Jair Messias Bolsonaro was born on 21 March 1955 in [[Glicério]], São Paulo,[35] in [[Southeast Region, Brazil]] Brazil, to Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro and Olinda Bonturi.[36][37] His family is mostly of [[Italian Brazilians]] descent, with [[German Brazilians]] ancestry as well.
On his father's side, he is the great-grandson of Italians from [[Veneto]] and [[Calabria]].[38] Bolsonaro's paternal grandfather's family comes from Veneto, more precisely [[Anguillara Veneta]], in the [[Province of Padua]].
Vittorio's parents immigrated to Brazil when he was ten, together with his siblings, Giovanna and Tranquillo.[39][38] His German ancestry came from his father's maternal grandfather, Carl "Carlos" Hintze, born in [[Hamburg]] around 1876, who immigrated to Brazil in 1883.[38] His maternal grandparents were born in [[Lucca]], in [[Tuscany]], and went to live in Brazil in the 1890s.[38] On 21 January 2022 his mother, Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro, died at age 94.
Bolsonaro spent most of his childhood moving around São Paulo with his family, living in [[Ribeira, São Paulo]], [[Jundiaí]], and [[Sete Barras]], before settling in [[Eldorado, São Paulo]], in the state's southern region, in 1966, where he grew up with his five siblings.[41] His first name is a tribute to [[Jair da Rosa Pinto]], a football player for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]], with whom he shares a birthday.[42][43]
In his final years in high school Bolsonaro was admitted to the [[Escola Preparatória de Cadetes do Exército]] (the prep school of the [[Brazilian Army]]), which he entered in 1973.
In 1974 he went to the [[Military Academy of Agulhas Negras]] (Brazil's premier military academy), graduating in 1977 as an [[Artillery]] officer.
He served in the 9th Field Artillery Group, in [[Nioaque]], Mato Grosso do Sul.
Later, he studied at the Army Physical Training School in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and served in the 21st Field Artillery Group and the 8th Paratrooper Field Artillery Group, from the [[Paratroopers Brigade (Brazil)]], also based in Rio.
His superior officers described him as "aggressive" and criticized his "excessive ambition for financial and economic gain." This assessment referred to Bolsonaro's attempt to mine gold in [[Bahia]], though he later claimed the activity was merely a "hobby and mental hygiene".[8][44]
Bolsonaro first caught the public's attention in 1986 when he wrote [[O salário está baixo]] published in the news magazine [[Veja (magazine)]].
Veja reported that, with an Army colleague, he had plans to plant bombs in military units in [[Rio de Janeiro]].
Bolsonaro entered politics in 1988, when he was elected to serve as a [[City councilor]] in Rio de Janeiro, representing the [[Christian Democratic Party (Brazil)]] (PDC).
Bolsonaro spent only two years in the [[Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro]].
In the 1990 elections Bolsonaro was elected a [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] for the Christian Democratic Party.
Bolsonaro's name was listed on the "Lista de Furnas [pt]", a list detailing a corruption and money laundering scheme involving the state-owned electricity company, [[Eletrobras Furnas]].[51] He received housing assistance for deputies who do not have residences in the capital [[Brasília]], despite having an apartment in the southwest of the city.
In his 27 years of service in the [[National Congress of Brazil]], Bolsonaro put forward one constitutional amendment and at least 171 bills, two of which became law.[54] Bolsonaro, who claimed to be persecuted by the left-wing parties, said most congressmen do not vote according to their agenda, but "by who the author of the bill is".[55]
In January 2018 he abandoned the [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)]] and switched to the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)]] (PSL).[citation needed] After his arrival, the PSL adopted conservative and right-wing positions, and its social liberal group [[Livres (movement)]] announced its departure from the PSL.[56][57]
On 22 July 2018 the PSL nominated Bolsonaro for president in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]].[58] The [[Brazilian Labour Renewal Party]] also endorsed him.
His coalition name was "Brazil above everything, God above everyone" (Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos).[59][60] Though contested by two lawsuits, the [[Superior Electoral Court]] of Brazil deferred them and his candidacy was made official on 6 August.[61] In August Bolsonaro announced that [[Antônio Hamilton Mourão]], a retired army general, would be his running mate.[62]
Economically, he started to support less government intervention in the economy (in contrast to the past, when he defended [[Developmentalism]] policies).
On the other hand, he maintained his tough stance on crime and his defence of "traditional family values".[63] Bolsonaro also said he planned to cut [[Taxation in Brazil]] across the board, particularly on inheritances and businesses, to generate growth and tackle unemployment.[64] He also promised more [[Austerity]] measures and cuts in government spending, but had difficulty naming the areas where he would make cuts.
He also said he would work to diminish the federal government's size and bureaucracy by enacting a wide variety of [[Deregulation]] measures.[65] Bolsonaro's promises to [[Law and order (politics)]] amid [[Crime in Brazil]] and to stamp out Brazil's rampant [[Corruption in Brazil]] won him huge popular support.[66] In October, he announced he would name [[Paulo Guedes]], a [[Liberal economist]], as his finance minister.[67]
On 9 August 2018 Bolsonaro attended the first presidential debate of the year, organized by the TV network [[Rede Bandeirantes]].[68] A week later, there was another debate at [[RedeTV!]][69] On 28 August he gave an interview to [[Jornal Nacional]], Brazil's highest-rated primetime news programme, at [[Rede Globo]].[70] Bolsonaro was the first presidential candidate to raise over [[Brazilian real]]1 million in donations from the public during the 2018 campaign.
After the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] candidate [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] was arrested in April 2018, Bolsonaro became the frontrunner according to all major opinion polls.[72][73] A [[Datafolha]] poll from September showed Bolsonaro as the leading candidate in the first round with 28% of vote intentions, though runoff scenarios showed him losing to [[Geraldo Alckmin]], [[Fernando Haddad]], and [[Ciro Gomes]] and tying with [[Marina Silva]].[74] Another Datafolha poll, conducted the week before election day, showed a considerable surge for Bolsonaro, who had 40% of vote intentions, or 36% when null or blank vote intentions were included.
In the speech he threatened to arrest, purge, or kill "reds" and "petralhas" (a derogatory term for Workers' Party members), and promised that members of the social movements [[Landless Workers' Movement]] and [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] would be treated as "terrorists".
It will be a cleaning never seen in the history of Brazil".[77][78] The "edge of the beach", a Bolsonaro aide later confirmed, was a reference to a [[Brazilian Navy]] base at [[Restinga da Marambaia]], in Rio de Janeiro State, where the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] tortured and killed dissidents.[79] The speech was widely condemned by rivals, journalists and politicians.[80][81][82][83]
In the news magazine [[Foreign Policy]], [[Federico Finchelstein]], a historian at the [[New School for Social Research]] who specializes in fascism, wrote, "Bolsonaro's vocabulary recalls the rhetoric behind Nazi policies of persecution and victimization.
However, things could change quickly if he gains power".[88] [[Jason Stanley]], a philosopher at [[Yale University]] who has published widely on [[Nazism]], said that Bolsonaro "uses more tactics associated to fascism than [the] American president [[Donald Trump]]".[89] [[Steven Levitsky]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]], said that Bolsonaro "is clearly authoritarian", but not a fascist.[90] Similar concerns were raised by analysts in Portugal[91] and Brazil.[92] Others, such as the [[Marxism]] historian [[Perry Anderson]], dismissed the "fascist" and "populist" labels altogether.[93]
According to an investigation by [[Folha de S.Paulo]], one of Brazil's bestselling newspapers, "Bolsonaro has been getting an illegal helping hand from a group of Brazilian entrepreneurs who are bankrolling a campaign to bombard [[WhatsApp]] users with [[Fake news]] about Haddad".[94] The suspicions led to a formal investigation by electoral authorities and the Federal Police; Bolsonaro and allies denied any wrongdoing.[95] Another controversial point was that Taíse Feijó, an adviser in Bolsonaro's government, was among those paid to feed fake news to his supporters.[96]
Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen on 6 September 2018 while campaigning and interacting with supporters in [[Juiz de Fora]], Minas Gerais.[97] At first, his son [[Flávio Bolsonaro]] stated that his father's wounds were only superficial and he was recovering in the hospital,[98] but he later said the wounds seemed worse than initially thought[99] and his father most likely would not be able to start campaigning personally before the end of the first round.[100] He posted on [[Twitter]] about his father's condition, explaining that the perforation had reached parts of the liver, lung, and intestine.
He also said that Bolsonaro had lost a large amount of blood, arriving at the hospital with severe [[Hypotension]] (his [[Blood pressure]] was 10/3, equivalent to 100/30 mmHg), but that he had since stabilized.[101][102][97] The attack was condemned by most of the other candidates in the presidential race, and by President [[Michel Temer]].[103] The day after the attack, Bolsonaro was transferred to the [[Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital]] in São Paulo, after a request from his family.
Police arrested the attacker and identified him as Adélio Bispo de Oliveira, who, according to security agents, claimed he was on "a mission from God".[105] He had been a member of the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]] from 2007 to 2014.
His condition prevented him from returning to the campaign trail for the remainder of the first round of the presidential election.[110] The first federal police investigation into the attack concluded that the attacker acted alone, but the investigation "leaves out many issues".[111] Bolsonaro said he did not observe "any effort by [the] former minister [[Sergio Moro]] to resolve the matter".[109] Joaquim de Carvalho has said that the police left out of their investigation the search for information by a mastermind of the attack or even a self-attack.
Bolsonaro's personal [[Motto]], which he established in 2016, is [[Gospel of John]] 8:32: "[[The truth will set you free]]".[113][114][115]
Bolsonaro was sworn in as president on 1 January 2019, succeeding [[Michel Temer]].[118] Bolsonaro began to [[Bolsonaro administration cabinet members]] before his inauguration, choosing the economist [[Paulo Guedes]] as his economy minister and the astronaut [[Marcos Pontes]] as his science and technology minister.[119] Bolsonaro said his cabinet would have 15 members; in December when he announced [[Ricardo Salles]] as a minister, the total was 22.
(His predecessor, [[Michel Temer]], had a 29-member cabinet.)[120]
Bolsonaro's initial [[Cabinet of Brazil]] was composed of 16 ministers, two cabinet-level positions, and four presidential secretaries, including Chief of Staff [[Onyx Lorenzoni]].[120] Bolsonaro's ministers included [[Operation Car Wash]] judge [[Sergio Moro]] as Justice Minister and congresswoman [[Tereza Cristina]] as Minister of Agriculture.[121][122] Bolsonaro placed many army officers in key positions in his cabinet.
Before his inauguration, he said he would fill positions in his government based only on technical qualifications and skills rather than ideological sympathy; however, many appointees clashed ideologically with the government during his presidency and fell out of favor with Bolsonaro.[123] By June 2020 the ministers of [[Sergio Moro]] and [[Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez]], the [[Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz]], the head of the [[Correios]] and other government officials had already resigned.[124]
Early in his administration, Bolsonaro focused primarily on domestic and economic issues, ranging from tax reform to changes in social security, but he faced an uphill battle with Congress.[125] Bolsonaro stripped the indigenous affairs agency [[Fundação Nacional do Índio]] of the responsibility to identify and demarcate [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)]], arguing that those territories have tiny, isolated populations who would be controlled by NPOs, and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society.
Critics feared that such integration would force [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]] to suffer [[Cultural assimilation]].[5] Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]] was the first foreign leader Bolsonaro received on a state visit to [[Brasília]] after he became president.[126]
The [[Second inauguration of Nicolás Maduro]] in Venezuela took place nine days after [[Brazilian presidential inauguration#Inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro]].
The disputed results of the [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election]] led to the [[Venezuelan presidential crisis]], as the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)]] rejected the results, considered Maduro an illegitimate ruler since his first term of office ended, and appointed [[Juan Guaidó]] as acting president.
Bolsonaro did not attend Maduro's inauguration and recognized Guaidó as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela, alongside [[Mauricio Macri]] from Argentina and [[Donald Trump]] from the US, among others.[127] He said that "We will continue doing everything possible to re-establish order, democracy and freedom there".[128]
After his first year in power, [[Opinion polling on the Jair Bolsonaro presidency]] steadily declined.
This was the first poll in which more Brazilians disapproved of Bolsonaro's government than approved of it.[129] Meanwhile, after allegations of campaign-finance fraud, Bolsonaro fired [[Gustavo Bebianno]], a top adviser and general secretary for the president.
He attempted to form his own party, [[Alliance for Brazil]] ([[Portuguese language]]: Aliança pelo Brasil),[131] but it failed to gather enough signatures to register at the [[Superior Electoral Court]] for the [[2020 Brazilian municipal elections]] or the [[2022 Brazilian general election]], leaving Bolsonaro without a party until 2021.[132][133]
Throughout the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil]], Bolsonaro and his administration were accused of downplaying the crisis while the number of Brazilians infected by the virus climbed exponentially by mid-2020.[134] Bolsonaro claimed that COVID-19 was no deadlier than "[[Influenza]]" and that his priority was the nation's economic recovery rather than the health crisis.[135] In fact, as at early 2021, the Brazilian economy was bouncing back, albeit somewhat slowly and inconsistently, as the pandemic was still threatening to undo any economic recovery.[136] Bolsonaro continually accused political opponents and the press of exaggerating the threat of the virus and called it a "fantasy" created by the media.[137][138]
In August 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, Bolsonaro's approval rating showed signs of recovery, reaching its highest level since his inauguration.[139] In November 2020 he said he would not take a COVID vaccine if it became available, but he later said he would support any possible vaccine if the [[Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency]] deemed it safe.[140] In the same broadcast, he called face masks "the last taboo to fall".[140] In 2020 the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP), an international non-governmental organization that investigates crime and corruption, gave Bolsonaro its Person of the Year Award, which "recognizes the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption".
YouTube has reportedly removed 15 videos altogether; one that was removed had shown Brazil's former health minister, [[Eduardo Pazuello]], comparing the virus to HIV.[145] In other videos, Bolsonaro criticized efforts to stop the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks or taking the vaccine.[146]
By the end of June 2021, more members of the opposition started to call for his impeachment over his handling of the pandemic and spreading [[COVID-19 misinformation]].
After months of denying offers of vaccines and bartering the costs, Bolsonaro's government made a deal to buy the unapproved [[Covaxin]] vaccine from the Indian company Bharat Biotech at a very high price.[150] It was found that the government paid ten times the amount agreed by Bharat Biotech for the vaccine,[151] and that the irregularities were found not in the price of the vaccine, but in a payment of $45 million to a company in Singapore.[152] In response, the Supreme Court authorized a criminal investigation of Bolsonaro.[153]
In March 2021 Bolsonaro dismissed [[Fernando Azevedo e Silva]] as defence minister and replaced him with [[Walter Souza Braga Netto]]; like Bolsonaro, Netto lionized the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil]].
On 28 July 2021 Bolsonaro appointed [[Ciro Nogueira Lima Filho]], a senator who was implicated in the [[Odebrecht Case]], as his [[Chief of Staff of the Presidency]].[158] In early August 2021, Bolsonaro threatened to respond with unconstitutional measures to an investigation over his baseless allegations of fraud vulnerabilities in Brazil's electronic voting system, because he deemed that investigation unconstitutional.
Supreme Court Justice [[Alexandre de Moraes]] had approved the investigation.[159] In mid-August 2021 Bolsonaro warned of a potential "institutional rupture", while urging the Senate to charge de Moraes and another Supreme Court Judge, [[Luis Roberto Barroso]], the leader of the electoral court.[160] On 26 October 2021 a Senate committee approved a report calling for Bolsonaro to face criminal charges, including crimes against humanity, for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.[161]
Without a political party, Bolsonaro began to negotiate his entrance in to one in preparation for the [[2022 Brazilian general election]] (as the [[1988 Brazilian Constitution]] does not allow [[Independent politician]]).[162] He negotiated with the [[Progressistas]] (PP), of which he was a member from 1995 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2016,[163] and the [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)]] (PSC), of which he was a member from 2016 to 2018,[164] the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)]] (PTB),[165] [[Brazilian Woman's Party]] (PMB),[166] [[Christian Democracy (Brazil)]] (DC), [[Party of National Mobilization]] (PMN),[164] the [[Republicans (Brazil)]] and [[Patriot (Brazil)]] (PATRI).[167] On 30 November 2021 Bolsonaro and his son Senator [[Flávio Bolsonaro]] joined the [[Liberal Party (Brazil, 2006)]] (PL).[163] According to political analysts, the choice represented the consolidation of the alliance of Bolsonaro with the [[Centrão]],[168] a large bloc of parties without consistent ideological orientation that supports different sides of the political spectrum to gain political privileges—PL being one of them.
Bolsonaro previously made deals with the Centrão for support in Congress.[169] On 23 June 2022 Bolsonaro defended his former education minister, [[Milton Ribeiro]], after the latter was arrested on corruption charges.[170]
In the second round of the presidential election on 30 October, Bolsonaro was defeated by former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], who took 50.9% of the votes cast.[171] Lula had won the most votes in the first round of the election on 2 October, receiving 48.43% of the votes cast: Bolsonaro received 43.20%.[172][173] In a press conference at the [[Palácio da Alvorada]] on 1 November, Bolsonaro did not acknowledge his defeat but stated that he would "comply with the Constitution".
The documentary [[Apocalypse in the Tropics]] (2024) shows how evangelical pastor [[Silas Malafaia]] had a defining influence on Bolsanaro, while mustering support from Brazil's evangelical movement, in the path to Bolsanaro losing the election and in the protests and attempted insurrection that followed.[179]
On 30 December 2022, one day before the end of his term, Bolsonaro arrived in the [[US state]] of [[Florida]] and resided in [[Kissimmee]] for several months.[180][181] On 8 January 2023 [[8 January Brasília attacks]] the buildings of the [[Supreme Court of Brazil]], the [[National Congress of Brazil]] and the [[Palácio do Planalto]] in an attempt to instigate a military coup d'état and reinstate Bolsonaro as president.[182] While the riots were going on, President Lula blamed Bolsonaro in a press conference.[182][183] Bolsonaro condemned the protesters in a Twitter post on 9 January,[184] and denied responsibility.[183] In February 2023 Bolsonaro announced that he would be returning to Brazil in March.[185] This would be the first time Bolsonaro had returned to the country since December 2022.[186] Bolsonaro had entered the United States on a diplomatic visa which expired on 31 January, but the family applied for tourist visas to extend their stay in Florida.[187]
Bolsonaro has stated that he returned to the country to help his party and asserted that he intended to campaign for the [[2024 Brazilian municipal elections]].[188] On 14 April 2023 Supreme Court judge [[Alexandre de Moraes]] ordered Bolsonaro to submit himself for questioning with the [[Brazilian Federal Police]] over the storming of the Congress.[189]
On 30 June 2023 the [[Superior Electoral Court]] barred Bolsonaro from running for public office until 2030 as a result of his attempts to undermine the validity of Brazil's 2022 democratic election, as well as for abuse of power with regard to using government channels to promote his campaign.[191][192] The decision applies to municipal, state and federal elections for the next eight years.
On 31 October 2023 Bolsonaro was again convicted by the Superior Electoral Court over [[Abuse of power]] for using official [[Independence Day (Brazil)]] ceremony to promote himself as a candidate which is banned under the Brazilian law.
Former defence minister [[Walter Braga Netto]], who also attended the ceremony, and also ran for vice president on Bolsonaro's ticket, was convicted by the Court and ruled disqualified, like Bolsonaro, to run for any office for the next eight years.[194]
In February 2024 the Federal Police raided former government officials and ordered Bolsonaro to hand in his passport over accusations that he and his allies tried to overturn the results of the 2022 election and planned a [[Coup d'état]].[195] In March 2024, witness documents released by the Superior Electoral Court were made public.
In his testimony the former [[Brazilian Army]] commander [[Marco Antônio Freire Gomes]] said that he had warned Bolsonaro the army would not tolerate "any act of institutional rupture", and further added that Bolsonaro's actions could result in his arrest.
The former [[Brazilian Air Force]] commander [[Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior]] testified that he tried to dissuade Bolsonaro of "any extreme measure" and expressed his belief that Freire Gomes was instrumental in avoiding the use of a legal document that Bolsonaro presented in several meetings in December 2022 to overturn the results of the election.
Baptista Júnior further said that the then [[Brazilian Navy]] commander [[Almir Garnier Santos]] told Bolsonaro he would put his troops at his disposal, and commented: "If the commander [Freire Gomes] had agreed, possibly, a coup d'état attempt would have taken place."[196][197][198]
In late March 2024 [[The New York Times]] released footage from internal security cameras in the Hungarian embassy in Brasília showing Bolsonaro and his aides and bodyguards entering the building on 12 February and leaving the place on 14 February.
Following the report, the Supreme Court gave Bolsonaro a 48-hour deadline to explain his stay in the embassy,[200] and the Federal Police announced it was opening an investigation into the incident; which could have been viewed as an attempt to escape justice via [[Diplomatic law#Diplomatic asylum]], since embassies are typically considered inviolable and host countries cannot enforce their law inside them without permission.[201] Media commentators and people on social media speculated this hypothesis was likely to be true citing Bolsonaro and Hungarian prime minister [[Viktor Orbán]] are both right-wing populist politicians who share a personal friendship, and Hungary's previous granting of asylum to the sanctioned former Macedonian prime minister [[Nikola Gruevski]].[202][203] Additionally, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)]] summoned Halmai to give explanations about Bolsonaro's two-night stay in the embassy.[204]
On 19 March 2024 the Federal Police formally accused Bolsanaro of fraud on his COVID-19 vaccine records.[205] In November 2024 he and 36 others were formally charged with plotting a coup d'état, violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, and criminal organisation.[206][207] In February 2025 Bolsonaro and 33 others were formally charged with plotting to assassinate Lula da Silva and Supreme Court Justice [[Alexandre de Moraes]].[208] On 26 March the Supreme Federal Court ordered Bolsonaro and seven of his associates to stand trial over the charges.[209]
On 9 July 2025 US president [[Donald Trump]] criticized the criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro, accused Brazil of being an unfair trading partner, and claimed the [[Tariffs in the second Trump administration]] was still less than what the US needed for a "level playing field"—despite the US trade surplus with Brazil.[212] This led to comparisons about [[Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case)]] involving the [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal]][213] and [[Arrest of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] [pt],[214] and Trump's [[Presidential eligibility of Donald Trump]] after the 6 January [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]][215] versus Bolsonaro's [[Ineligibility of Jair Bolsonaro]] after the [[8 January Brasília attacks]].[216] Bolsonaro could request [[Asylum in the United States]]—especially given that Trump labelled Brazil's charges a "[[Witch hunt]]"—but would need safe‑conduct to leave Brazil and must prove credible political persecution.
On 18 July 2025 police again searched his home and ordered him to wear an [[Electronic tagging]].[219] On 26 August he was placed under 24-hour surveillance after being designated as a "flight-risk".[220]
On November 22, 2025, Bolsonaro was arrested, transferred to the headquarters of the Brazil federal police in Brasilia and ordered by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to be transferred back to prison after he attempted to remove the electronic ankle tag and escape house arrest.[30][31][32] Bolsonaro blamed his actions on a nervous breakdown and hallucinations caused by a change in his medication.[223] A full Supreme Court vote on Bolsonaro's return to prison was then scheduled to be held on November 24, 2025.[30] On November 24, 2025, Bolsonaro's transfer from [[House arrest]], which lasted more than 100 days, became official when the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil, in a unanimous ruling, voted to approve keeping him in police custody.[33][34]
Bolsonaro's political views have been described as [[Brazilian nationalist]] and [[Right-wing populist]] in nature, and he himself as an advocate of [[Far-right politics]].[224][225] His supporters say that his views are more aligned with traditional right-wing conservatism.[226] His electorate is mainly formed by adults above the age of 34, the working middle to upper class (mainly in the southeast region of the country), conservatives in general, college graduates, some centrists and the [[Christian right]].[227] According to some polls, Bolsonaro's main support comes from the [[Southeast Region, Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil]], and [[South Region, Brazil]] regions of Brazil.
Bolsonaro is viewed as an [[Anti-abortion]],[231] [[Anti-establishment]], and pro-gun politician, voicing opposition to most forms of [[Gun laws in Brazil]], arguing that law-abiding citizens have the right to self-defence, especially those living in rural areas.[232] According to The Washington Post, "Homicides hit a [[Crime in Brazil]] of 63,880 last year ...
He has called for police to use more lethal force and wants to relax gun laws so that average citizens can defend themselves."[6] Bolsonaro often rejects accusations made against him of [[Misogyny]] and [[Homophobia]], and says he is not far-right but simply right-wing.[233]
Bolsonaro is known for his strong opposition to [[Left-wing politics]].
Most notably, he has been a vocal opponent of [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil]],[12] environmental regulations,[234] abortion,[14] [[Affirmative action]] (particularly racial quotas),[15] as well as immigration,[235] particularly from Haiti, Africa and the Middle East, which he once called "the scum of humanity".[225] He has also opposed [[Drug liberalization]],[16] land reforms,[236] and secularism at the federal level,[16] among other things.[237] Additionally, he made statements in defence of the [[Brazilian military regime]],[238] (a dictatorship known for constant human-rights violations).[239] He argues that torture is a "legitimate practice" and says that he would try to pass new legislation regarding the introduction of life imprisonment to the Brazilian penal code.[240] Bolsonaro supports the [[Privatization]] of state-owned companies and advocates [[Free-market]] policies,[241] although critics have stated that his policy-making record does not in fact show him to be a supporter of [[Economic liberalism]].[242]
In a 2017 interview with the journalist Claudio Dantas Sequeira from [[O Antagonista]], Bolsonaro said that his views are directly aligned with the centrist to right-wing United States citizens' views on gun ownership, abortion, gender politics, and trade, despite the "left-leaning media frenzy" against him.
He reiterated that he intends to reverse some disarmament laws, improve public security, and also improve trade ties with the United States, which he said were broken during [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s and [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s administrations.[243]
During his long political career, Bolsonaro expressed views regarded as being far-right.[244] He has made statements that some people considered insulting, homophobic,[245] violence-inciting,[246][247][248] misogynistic, sexist,[249][247][248] racist,[250][247][248] or anti-refugee.[251] Other controversial political stances expressed by Bolsonaro have been the defence of the death penalty, which is banned under the [[Constitution of Brazil]] of 1988, and of radical interventionism in Brazil by the military, along with an imposition of a Brazilian military government.[16][252]
The journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] called Bolsonaro "the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world".[253] [[News.com.au]] wondered whether Bolsonaro was "the world's most repulsive politician".[250] The news magazine [[The Economist]] referred to him as a "radical", "religious nationalist", a "right-wing demagogue", and "apologist of dictators".[254] [[Federico Finchelstein]], a scholar on fascism and populism, has considered Bolsonaro, as he would link violence to [[Austerity]] and [[Neoliberal]] economic ideas, to be the most similar leader to [[Augusto Pinochet]] to come out from the young South American democracies.[255] Leonardo Fontes, a postdoctoral researcher at the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, characterized Bolsonaro's economic views as [[Authoritarian neoliberalism]].[256]
As President of Brazil, Bolsonaro professed to be an open admirer of then-President of the United States, [[Donald Trump]], during [[First Trump administration]].
On 1 May 2019 Bolsonaro awarded [[Olavo de Carvalho]], a conservative writer and far-right [[Conspiracy theorist]],[258][259] the [[Order of Rio Branco]] honorific order.
Carvalho, who wrote books about [[Left-wing politics]] politics in Brazil and modern issues in general, was openly admired by Bolsonaro and sarcastically called by journalists his [[Guru]].[260][261][262][263] Carvalho was sometimes harshly critical of Bolsonaro, even calling him "dumb".[264][265][266][267]
Throughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made several admiring comments about the [[Brazilian military regime]], which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985.
He said in 1993, eight years after the return of democracy, that the military regime had "led to a more sustainable and prosperous Brazil".[8] He has publicly referred to the military dictatorship as a "glorious" period in Brazil's history,[268] and that under the military dictatorship, Brazil enjoyed "20 years of [[Order and Progress]]".[268] In December 2008 he said that "the error of the dictatorship was that it tortured, but did not kill".[269]
He praised Peruvian president [[Alberto Fujimori]] as a role model for his use of military intervention via [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis]] against the judiciary and legislature.[8] In a 1998 interview with Veja magazine, Bolsonaro praised the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]], and said the Pinochet regime, which killed over 3,000 Chilean citizens, "should have killed more people".[270] In 1999 Bolsonaro said that [[Hugo Chávez]] represented "hope for Latin America", comments that became a matter of controversy during the 2018 campaign, when Bolsonaro presented himself as a harsh critic of [[Chavismo]].[271] In 2019, already in power, Bolsonaro commended Paraguayan dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]] as a "visionary" and "statesman", drawing immediate criticism, particularly due to multiple allegations of [[Pedophilia]] against Stroessner.[272][273] The comments were made in front of Paraguayan president [[Mario Abdo Benítez]], himself a child of Stroessner's personal secretary, Mario Abdo Benítez Sr.[274]
Speaking before his vote in favour of [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff]] amid the [[Operation Car Wash]], Bolsonaro paid homage to Colonel [[Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra]], an agent of [[Brazilian military government]], and announced on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies that he was dedicating his pro-impeachment vote to Ustra's memory.
Ustra had headed the [[DOI-CODI]] torture unit where Rousseff was allegedly tortured during the military dictatorship.
The left-wing deputy [[Jean Wyllys]] spat at him after his statement during the same session.
As of 2018[update], he appeared to have changed his mind, and said that if someone becomes the head of the country, it would be through voting.[277] In March 2019 Bolsonaro stated that the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]], which overthrew President [[João Goulart]],[278] was not a [[Coup d'état]], and that 31 March, the day the coup was installed, should be "properly commemorated".[279][280][281]
During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro said he would make considerable changes to Brazil's foreign relations, saying that the "[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)]] needs to be in service of the values that were always associated with the Brazilian people".
He also said that the country should stop "praising dictators" and attacking democracies, such as the United States, Israel and Italy.[282] In early 2018 he affirmed that his "trip to the five democratic countries the United States, Israel, Japan, [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] showed who we will be and we would like to join good people".
Bolsonaro showed distrust towards China throughout the presidential campaign claiming they "[want to] buy Brazil",[283][284] although Brazil recorded a US$20 billion trade surplus with China in 2018, and China is only the 13th largest source of foreign direct investment into Brazil.[285] Bolsonaro said he wished to continue to do business with the Chinese but he also said that Brazil should "make better [economic] deals" with other countries, with no "ideological agenda" behind it.[233] His stance towards China has also been interpreted by some[who?] as an attempt to curry favor with the [[Donald Trump]] administration to garner concessions from the US.[285] However, Bolsonaro mostly changed his position on China after he took office, saying that the two countries were "born to walk together" during his visit to Beijing in October 2019.[286][287] He also said that Brazil would stay out of the ongoing [[China–United States trade war]].[286] According to [[Oliver Stuenkel]], Bolsonaro's stance on global politics evolved from anti-China to anti-Western during his presidency.[288] In 2022 he praised the role of BRICS during the [[2008 financial crisis]] and described BRICS cooperation as a "factor of stability and prosperity in the international situation".[289]
Bolsonaro said that his first international trip as president would be to [[Brazil–Israel relations]].[290] Bolsonaro also said that the [[State of Palestine]] "is not a country, so there should be no embassy here", adding that "you don't negotiate with terrorists."[290] The announcement was warmly received by the prime minister of Israel, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], who welcomed Bolsonaro to Israel in March 2019 during the final weeks of a re-election campaign,[291] but met condemnation from the [[Arab League]], which warned Bolsonaro it could damage diplomatic ties.[292] "I love Israel", Bolsonaro said in [[Hebrew language]] at a welcoming ceremony, with Netanyahu at his side, at [[Ben Gurion Airport]] in [[Tel Aviv]].[293]
Bolsonaro also praised US President [[Donald Trump]] and [[Foreign policy of the first Donald Trump administration]],[282] and has been called "the tropical Trump".[294] His son [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]] has indicated that Brazil should distance itself from [[Iran]], sever ties with [[Nicolás Maduro]]'s government in [[Venezuela]] and relocate [[List of diplomatic missions in Israel]] to [[Jerusalem]], although he never committed to his plan to move the embassy and instead opened a [[Trade office]] in the city.[295][296] Bolsonaro is widely considered the most [[Foreign relations of the United States]] candidate in Brazil since the 1980s.
PSL members said that if elected, he would dramatically improve [[Brazil–United States relations]].[18] During an October 2017 campaign rally in Miami, he saluted the [[Flag of the United States]] and led chants of "USA! USA!" to a large crowd.[297] US National Security Advisor [[John R.
Bolton]] praised Bolsonaro as a "like-minded" partner and said his victory was a "positive sign" for Latin America.[298] Bolsonaro had a fractious relationship with US President [[Joe Biden]],[299] and subsequently deepened ties with [[Russia]], emphasizing his neutrality over the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].[20]
At the regional level, Bolsonaro praised Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]] for ending the 12-year rule of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], which he saw as similar to Lula and Rousseff.
Although he does not have plans to leave the [[Mercosur]], he criticized it for prioritizing ideological issues over economic ones.[300] A staunch anti-communist, Bolsonaro has condemned [[Cuba]]'s former leader [[Fidel Castro]] and the regime on that island as of 2018[update].[301][302]
Bolsonaro praised British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], saying that he had learnt from Churchill: "Patriotism, love for your fatherland, respect for your flag – something that has been lost over the last few years here in Brazil ...
and governing through example, especially at that difficult moment of the Second World War."[301] Bolsonaro said he was open to the possibility of hosting a [[United States military deployments]] in Brazil to counter Russian influence in the region.[303] With the intention to persuade Trump to make Brazil a [[NATO]] member in March 2019, Bolsonaro said: "the discussions with the United States will begin in the coming months".[304][305][306][307]
With formal US support for Brazil's entry to [[OECD]] in May 2019, Bolsonaro said, "currently, all 36 members of the organization support the entry of the country, fruit of confidence in the new Brazil being built, more free, open and fair".[308][309][310] In October 2019, on a state visit to China, he announced the end of the need for visas for Chinese and Indian entry into Brazil.
Brazil has the world's [[Amazon rainforest]] in the [[Amazon basin]].
According to [[The Washington Post]], "Bolsonaro is a powerful supporter of [[Agriculture in Brazil]] ...
Bolsonaro has chafed at foreign pressure to safeguard [[Amazon rainforest]], and he served notice to international nonprofit groups such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] that he will not tolerate their agendas in Brazil.
He has also come out strongly against [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)]] reserved for [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]].
Bolsonaro advisers additionally say that he plans to expand [[Nuclear activities in Brazil]] and hydroelectric power into the Amazon."[6]
Bolsonaro rejects the [[Scientific consensus on climate change]].
He repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the [[Paris Agreement]] during his campaign.[314][315] Even before taking office, he backed out of Brazil's offer to host the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference.[316] [[Ernesto Araújo]], the new Minister of Foreign Affairs appointed by Bolsonaro, has called global warming [[Global warming conspiracy theory]] by "cultural Marxists",[317] and eliminated the Climate Change Division of the ministry.[315] Two departments of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Brazil)]] dealing with [[Climate change in Brazil]] and mitigation and one dealing with deforestation were also eliminated.[315]
In April 2019 the [[American Museum of Natural History]] canceled an event honouring Bolsonaro after facing heavy public criticism, including from New York Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]].
This traditional event will go forward at another location on the original date and time."[318] Bolsonaro supported plans to open the Reserva Nacional do Cobre e Associados (Renca) [[Amazon rainforest]] reserve in Brazil's northern states of [[Pará]] and [[Amapá]] to commercial mining.[319]
[[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest]] increased by 88% for the month of June 2019, during Bolsonaro's first year as president, as compared with the previous year, according to the [[National Institute for Space Research]] (INPE).
His damage to the Amazon has widely been described by indigenous groups, human rights groups, politicians, academics and journalists as an [[Ecocide]] and a [[Genocide]].[325][326][327][328] Indigenous chiefs and human rights organizations have submitted an Article 15 communication to the [[International Criminal Court]] for crimes against humanity and genocide for harm to Indigenous people and destruction of the Amazon.[329][330][331] Another has been submitted for ecocide by indigenous chiefs.[332][333]
Bolsonaro is a member of the [[Catholic Church in Brazil]] (while his wife and one of his sons are [[Evangelical Christian]])[334] and is registered as one with the [[Superior Electoral Court]].
In 2016, he was [[Rebaptism]] along with three of his sons, [[Flávio Bolsonaro]], [[Carlos Bolsonaro]] and [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]], in the [[Jordan River]] by a member of a [[Pentecostalism]] church.
The sociologist Christina Vital of the [[Fluminense Federal University]] stated that this act was more than an expression of conversion to [[Evangelicalism]] and was meant to create an ambiguous religious identity, through which the Bolsonaro family could appeal to the various groups of voters.[335]
Bolsonaro reportedly attended a [[Baptist]] church for 10 years.[336] In a 2017 speech, Bolsonaro stated, "God above everything.
There is no such thing as a [[Secular state]].
In an interview with Zero Hora in 2015, Bolsonaro argued that men and women should not receive the same salaries, because women get pregnant, adding that he believes federal law mandating paid [[Maternity leave]] harms work productivity.[339] Bolsonaro has denied saying that women should receive less than men; he claims it was statistical data by [[IBGE]].[340] In a public speech in April 2017, Bolsonaro said he had five children, that the first four were male and that for the fifth he produced a daughter out of "a moment of weakness".[341]
Bolsonaro provoked controversy for a series of remarks made to and about Federal Deputy and former Human Rights Minister [[Maria do Rosário]].
During a Congressional debate, Bolsonaro said that minors should be [[Trial as an adult]] if they commit heinous crimes such as murder or rape, to which Maria do Rosário responded by calling him a "rapist".[342][343][344] Bolsonaro then stated that Congresswoman Rosário was "not worth raping; she is very ugly".[249] The remarks drew considerable condemnation throughout Brazil.
In the aftermath of these remarks, Bolsonaro was tried and convicted in a Federal court in September 2015 on counts of [[Hedonic damages]] against Rosário.[345] In June 2016 the Federal Supreme Court responded to a complaint filed by the [[Attorney General of Brazil]] and decided to open two criminal actions against Bolsonaro.
He faced a penalty of up to six months of jail and a fine.[346] Ultimately in August 2017, an appellate court upheld a lower court's verdict which found Bolsonaro guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine to Rosário of R$10,000 (roughly equivalent to US$2,500).[347] This lawsuit was dismissed by the Supreme Federal Court as Bolsonaro was inaugurated as president in 2019 and acquired [[Legal immunity]].[348]
In a June 2011 interview with [[Playboy]], Bolsonaro said, "I would be incapable of loving a gay son", and added that he would prefer any gay son of his "to die in an accident".[351] In an interview that same month with Jornal de Notícias, Bolsonaro [[LGBT grooming conspiracy theory]] to [[Pedophilia]], saying, "many of the children who are adopted by gay couples will be abused by these couples".[352] He further argued that Brazil does not need legislation specifically targeting homophobia, because "most homosexuals are murdered by their respective pimps at hours when good citizens are already asleep".[16] In the British actor [[Stephen Fry]]'s 2013 documentary Out There, Bolsonaro said, "no father is ever proud of having a gay son" and "we Brazilians do not like homosexuals".[353]
In a March 2016 video interview for [[Vice Media]] with [[Elliot Page]], an openly lesbian actress at the time, Page asked Bolsonaro whether he should have been beaten as a child (alluding to Bolsonaro's public statements that gay children should be beaten).
On 9 November 2017 the Court of Justice for the State of Rio de Janeiro sentenced Bolsonaro to pay a fine of R$150,000 for [[Hate speech]] because of televised comments he made in 2011 to the [[Custe o Que Custar]] television programme, when Bolsonaro stated that "there is no risk" of his family producing a homosexual child because his children had a "good education".
However, on 11 January 2016, when he began to present himself as a pre-candidate to the [[Presidency of Brazil]], Bolsonaro began to moderate his discourse on gay people by publishing a video on his official YouTube channel:
It is a work for everyone".[338] After being elected president, when asked by [[William Bonner (newscaster)]] in the [[Jornal Nacional]] about what he would say to those who are more prejudiced and aggressive against gays, Bolsonaro replied: "The aggression against a fellow man has to be punished in the way of law.
In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of "changing" Brazil was by "[[Dirty War]], beginning with [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]" (then President of Brazil).[360] During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in [[Acre (state)]] that the local "petralhas" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be "shot"; according to his aides, the statement was a "joke".[361] One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration "petralhas" and "reds" (i.e. leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the "corner of the beach", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] were murdered.[79]
Throughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made numerous statements that have been described as racist.[364] In 2011, when asked by the Afro-Brazilian singer [[Preta Gil]] on TV show Custe o Que Custar (CQC) what he would do if one of his sons had a black girlfriend, he answered that he "would not discuss promiscuity" and that there was "no such risk", because his children were "very well educated".
In 2017, in an event at the Hebraica club in Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro promised to abolish all [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]] and [[Quilombola]] territories in Brazil, saying that he would not cede "a centimiter" of land to these groups.
He also claimed to have visited a [[Quilombo]], a settlement formed by descendants of enslaved people, accusing [[Afro-Brazilians]] who lived there of being lazy and unproductive.
The politician also claimed that the "least heavy" of the quilombolas weighed seven [[Arroba]], a unit of measure that is used in Brazil to weigh cattle.[366] These comments have been criticized as an attempt to [[Dehumanization]] black Brazilians.[367]
Bolsonaro is a strong opponent of [[Affirmative action]], and has criticized the Brazilian racial quotas system in universities as a way of dividing society that is at odds with equality between citizens.[368] In 2011, he was accused of racism after questioning the capabilities of Black and indigenous graduates who benefitted from affirmative action, claiming that he would not fly on an airplane piloted by one of them, nor accept a doctor who was admitted to a university through racial quotas to perform surgery on him.[15]
It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Família]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc.
Bolsonaro has endorsed conspiracy theories of [[Voter fraud]] in past elections, including claims that attempts were made to rig the 2018 presidential election against him;[374] he has also questioned the outcome of the [[2020 United States presidential election]].[375] During his presidency, he has repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of [[Electronic voting]] and advocated the use of paper ballots in the 2022 election.[376] Bolsonaro said that he would not accept the results of the 2022 election if electoral reforms were not implemented.[375][377] Most experts on Brazilian politics, including defence minister [[Celso Amorim]], questioned the likelihood of a coup attempt, and polls found that few Bolsonaro supporters would likely endorse a coup.[376][375] In May 2022, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[William J.
Burns (diplomat)]] warned Bolsonaro against any further attacks on Brazil's electoral system.[377] The 2022 election occurred days after the success of far-right politician [[Giorgia Meloni]] in the [[2022 Italian general election]],[378] with analysts noting that Bolsonaro performed better than expected during the first round of elections and that his party's success had the potential to moderate Lula's government if Lula won the election.[379][380]
His first wife was Rogéria Nantes Braga (with whom he has three sons: [[Flávio Bolsonaro]], [[Carlos Bolsonaro]], and [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]]).
In 2007 he married his third wife, [[Michelle Bolsonaro]], with whom he has a daughter named Laura.[381][382]
He was forced to fire her after the [[Supreme Federal Court]] ruled that [[Nepotism]] is illegal in the public administration.[383][384] In 2018 Bolsonaro and his wife lived in [[Barra da Tijuca]], Rio de Janeiro.[385]
Bolsonaro has three granddaughters, two by Flávio[386] and one by Eduardo.[387] Bolsonaro is [[Catholic Church]].[388] On 25 October 2018 he was presented with an honorary black belt by [[Robson Gracie]] despite never having trained [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].[389]
On September 16, 2025, Bolsonaro's son said he was transported to a hospital in [[Brasília]] after reportedly feeling sick.[390] The next day, it was announced that Bolsonaro was diagnosed with an early type of [[Skin cancer]].[391]
