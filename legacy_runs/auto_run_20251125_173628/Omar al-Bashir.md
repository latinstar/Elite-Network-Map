Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir[a] (born 1 January 1944) is a Sudanese former military officer and politician who served as [[Head of state of Sudan]] under various titles from 1989 until 2019, when he was deposed in [[2019 Sudanese coup d'état]].[2] He was subsequently imprisoned, tried and convicted on multiple corruption charges.[3][4]
Al-Bashir came to power in 1989 when, as a [[Brigadier general]] in the [[Sudanese Army]], he led a group of officers in [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état]] that ousted the democratically elected government of prime minister [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] after it began negotiations with rebels in the south; he subsequently replaced President [[Ahmed al-Mirghani]] as head of state.[5] He was elected three times as president in elections that have been under scrutiny for [[Electoral fraud]].[6] In 1998, al-Bashir founded the [[National Congress Party (Sudan)]], which remained the dominant political party in the country until 2019.[7] In March 2009, al-Bashir became the first sitting head of state to be [[International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur#Omar al-Bashir]] (ICC), for allegedly directing a campaign of mass killing, rape, and pillage against civilians in [[Darfur]].[8] On 11 February 2020, the [[Government of Sudan]] announced that it had agreed to hand over al-Bashir to the [[International Criminal Court]] for trial.[9]
In October 2005, al-Bashir's government negotiated an end to the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]],[10] leading to a referendum in the south, resulting in the separation of the south as the country of [[South Sudan]].
In the Darfur region, he oversaw the [[War in Darfur]] that resulted in death tolls of around 10,000 according to the Sudanese Government,[11] but most sources suggest between 200,000[12] and 400,000.[13][14][15] During his presidency, there were several violent struggles between the [[Janjaweed]] militia and rebel groups such as the [[Army]] (SLA) and the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) in the form of [[Guerrilla warfare]] in the Darfur region.
The civil war displaced[16] over 2.5 million people out of a total population of 6.2 million in Darfur[17] and created a crisis in [[Chad–Sudan relations]] between [[Sudan]] and [[Chad]].[18] The rebels in Darfur lost the support from [[Libya]] after the death of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and the collapse of his regime in 2011.[19][20][21]
In July 2008, the prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], accused al-Bashir of [[Genocide]], [[Crimes against humanity]], and [[War crime]] in Darfur.[22] The court issued an [[Arrest warrant]] for al-Bashir on 4 March 2009 on counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide.[23][24] However, on 12 July 2010, the court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts of genocide.
The new warrant, like the first, was delivered to the [[Politics of Sudan]], which did not recognize either the warrant or the ICC.[24] The indictments did not allege that Bashir personally took part in such activities; instead, they said that he was "suspected of being criminally responsible, as an indirect co-perpetrator".[25] The court's decision was opposed by the [[African Union]], [[Arab League]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement]] as well as the governments of Libya, [[Somalia]], [[Jordan]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], South Sudan, [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Palestine]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].[26][27]
From December 2018 onwards, al-Bashir faced [[Sudanese Revolution]] which demanded his removal from power.
On 11 April 2019, Bashir was [[2019 Sudanese coup d'état]] in a military coup d'état.[28][29] In September 2019, Bashir was replaced by the [[Transitional Military Council (2019)]] which transferred executive power to a mixed civilian–military [[Sovereignty Council of Sudan]] and a civilian prime minister, [[Abdalla Hamdok]].
Two months later, the [[Forces of Freedom and Change]] alliance (which holds indirect political power during the [[2019 Sudanese transition to democracy]]), Hamdok, and Sovereignty Council member [[Siddiq Tawer]] stated that Bashir would be eventually transferred to the ICC.
Al-Bashir was born on 1 January 1944 in [[Hosh Bannaga]],[34] a village on the outskirts of [[Shendi]], just north of the capital, [[Khartoum]], to a family that hails from the [[Ja'alin tribe]] of northern [[Sudan]].
He is the second among twelve brothers and sisters; his younger brother Othman was killed in South Sudan during his presidency.[38] His uncle, [[Al Taib Mustafa]], was a journalist, politician, and noted opponent of South Sudan.[39] As a boy, he was nicknamed 'Omeira' – Little Omar.[40] He belongs to the [[Bedaria tribe]], a [[Bedouin]] tribe belonging to the larger [[Ja'alin]] coalition,[41] a [[Sudanese Arabs]] tribe in middle north of Sudan (once a part of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]).
As a child, Al-Bashir loved [[Association football]].
"That's why he went into the army." He received his primary education at the [[Sudanese Military College]], and his family later moved to [[Khartoum North]] where he completed his secondary education and became a supporter of [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)]].
He also has a [[Polygamy#Africa]] named Widad Babiker Omer, who had a number of children with her first husband Ibrahim Shamsaddin, a member of the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] who had died in a helicopter crash.
In 1975, al-Bashir was sent to the [[United Arab Emirates]] as the Sudanese [[Military attaché]].
When he returned to Sudan as a colonel in the [[Military of Sudan]], al-Bashir led a group of army officers in ousting the unstable coalition government of Prime Minister [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] in a bloodless [[Coup d'état]] on 30 June 1989.[5] Under al-Bashir's leadership, the new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.[45] He then became chairman of the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] (a newly established body with legislative and executive powers for what was described as a transitional period), and assumed the posts of [[Chief of state]], prime minister, chief of the armed forces, and [[Minister of Defence (Sudan)]].[46] Subsequent to al-Bashir's promotion to the chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, he allied himself with [[Hassan al-Turabi]], the leader of the [[National Islamic Front]], who, along with al-Bashir, began institutionalizing [[Sharia]] in the northern part of Sudan.
On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir increased his power when he appointed himself [[List of Presidents of Sudan]] of the country, after which he disbanded the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] and all other rival political parties.
The executive and legislative powers of the council were later given to al-Bashir completely.[48] In the early 1990s, al-Bashir's administration gave the green light to float a new currency called [[Sudanese dinar]] to replace the battered old [[Sudanese pound]] that had lost 90 percent of its worth during the turbulent 1980s; the currency was later changed back to pounds, but at a much higher rate.
He was later elected president (with a five-year term) in the [[1996 Sudanese general election]], where he was the only candidate legally allowed to run for election.[49]
Omar al-Bashir was elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election[49] and [[Hassan al-Turabi]] was elected to a seat in the National Assembly where he served as speaker of the National Assembly "during the 1990s".[50] In 1998, al-Bashir and the Presidential Committee put into effect a new constitution, allowing limited political associations in opposition to al-Bashir's [[National Congress Party (Sudan)]] and his supporters to be formed.
On 12 December 1999, al-Bashir sent troops and tanks against parliament and ousted [[Hassan al-Turabi]], the speaker of parliament, in a [[Palace coup]].[51]
He was reelected by popular vote for a five-year term during the [[2000 Sudanese general election]].[52]
From 2005 to 2010,[citation needed] a transitional government was set up under a 2005 peace accord that ended the 21-year long [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and saw the formation of a power-sharing agreement between [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]]'s [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] (SPLM) and al Bashir's [[National Congress (Sudan)]] (NCP).[53]
Al-Bashir was reelected president in the [[2010 Sudanese general election]] with 68% of the popular vote;[54] while Salva Kiir was [[2010 Southern Sudanese general election]].
European observers, from the [[European Union]] and the [[Carter Center]], criticised the polls as "not meeting international standards".
This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into [[2011–2013 Sudanese protests]], raising discontent within the [[Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation]] (SWTUF).
In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi's links to [[Islamic fundamentalism]] groups, as well as allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting [[Osama bin Laden]] to the country.[57] The [[United States]] had listed Sudan as a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] since 1993,[58] mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s.[59] [[United States]].
firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997.[60] In 1998, the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in [[Khartoum]] was destroyed by a U.S. [[Cruise missile]] strike because of its alleged production of [[Chemical weapon]] and links to [[Al-Qaeda]].
However the U.S. State Department [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in [[The New York Times]]: "Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State [[Phyllis Oakley]] that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate.
After being re-elected president of Sudan with a five-year-term in the [[1996 Sudanese general election]] with 75.7% of the popular vote,[62] al-Bashir issued the registration of legalized political parties in 1999 after being influenced by al-Turabi.
Rival parties such as the [[Liberal Democrats (Sudan)]] and the Alliance of the Peoples' Working Forces, headed by former Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], were established and were allowed to run for election against al-Bashir's [[National Congress Party (Sudan)]], however, they failed to achieve significant support, and al-Bashir was re-elected president, receiving 86.5% of the popular vote in the [[2000 Sudanese general election]].
At the [[2000 Sudanese general election]] that same year, al-Bashir's National Congress Party won 355 out of 360 seats, with al-Turabi as its chairman.
However, after al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the president's powers, prompting al-Bashir to dissolve parliament and declare a [[State of emergency]], tensions began to rise between al-Bashir and al-Turabi.
Then, a splinter-faction led by al-Turabi, the Popular National Congress Party (PNC) signed an agreement with [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]], which led al-Bashir to believe that they were plotting to overthrow him and the government.[62]
Further on, al-Turabi's influence and that of his party's "'internationalist' and ideological wing" waned "in favor of the 'nationalist' or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan's disastrous [[International isolation]] and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism".[63] At the same time, Sudan worked to appease the United States and other international critics by expelling members of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and encouraging bin Laden to leave.[64]
From the early 1990s, after al-Bashir assumed power, Sudan backed [[Iraq]] in its [[Gulf War]][69][70] and was accused of harbouring and providing sanctuary and assistance to Islamic terrorist groups.
[[Carlos the Jackal]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Abu Nidal]] and others labeled "terrorist leaders" by the United States and its allies resided in Khartoum.
Sudan's role in the [[Popular Arab and Islamic Congress]] (PAIC), spearheaded by [[Hassan al-Turabi]], represented a matter of great concern to the security of American officials and dependents in Khartoum, resulting in several reductions and evacuations of American personnel from Khartoum in the early to mid 1990s.[71]
In late 1994, in an initial effort to reverse his nation's growing image throughout the world as a country harboring terrorists, Bashir secretly cooperated with French special forces to orchestrate the capture and arrest on Sudanese soil of [[Carlos the Jackal]].[72]
In early 1996, al-Bashir authorised his Defence Minister at the time, El Fatih Erwa, to make a series of secret trips to the United States[73] to hold talks with American officials, including officers of the [[CIA]] and [[United States Department of State]] about American sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to remove the sanctions.
Erwa was presented with a series of demands from the United States, including demands for information about [[Osama bin Laden]] and other radical Islamic groups.
Sudan's Mukhabarat (central intelligence agency) spent half a decade amassing intelligence data on bin Laden and a wide array of Islamists through their periodic annual visits for the PAIC conferences.[74] In May 1996, after the series of Erwa secret meetings on US soil, the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] demanded that Sudan expel Bin Laden.
The Sudanese insisted that an offer to extradite bin Laden had been made in a secret one-on-one meeting at a [[Fairfax, Virginia]] hotel between Erwa and the then [[CIA]] Africa Bureau chief on condition that [[Washington, D.C.]] end sanctions against Bashir's regime.
In August 1996, American hedge-fund manager [[Mansoor Ijaz]] travelled to Sudan and met with senior officials including al-Turabi and al-Bashir.
Ijaz conveyed his findings to US officials upon his return, including [[Sandy Berger]], then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and argued for the US to constructively engage the Sudanese and other Islamic countries.[77] In April 1997, Ijaz persuaded al-Bashir to make an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance in the form of a signed presidential letter that Ijaz delivered to Congressman [[Lee H.
In late September 1997, months after the Sudanese overture (made by al-Bashir in the letter to Hamilton), the U.S. State Department, under Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]]'s directive, first announced it would return American diplomats to Khartoum to pursue counterterrorism data in the [[Mukhabarat]]'s possession.
Within days, the U.S. reversed that decision[79] and imposed harsher and more comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against Sudan, which went into effect in October 1997.[80] In August 1998, in the wake of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], the U.S. launched [[Operation Infinite Reach]] against Khartoum.[81] U.S. Ambassador to Sudan, Tim Carney, departed post in February 1996[82] and no new ambassador was designated until December 2019, when U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]'s administration reached an agreement with the new Sudanese government to exchange ambassadors.[83]
Al-Bashir announced in August 2015 that he would travel to [[New York City]] in September to speak at the [[United Nations]].
When al-Bashir took power the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] had been ongoing for nine years.
The war soon effectively developed into a conflict between the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] and al-Bashir's government.
The peace was consolidated with the official signing by both sides of the [[Naivasha Agreement]] 9 January 2005, granting [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005–2011)]] for six years, to be followed by [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum]].
[[John Garang]], the south's peace agreement appointed co-vice president, died in a helicopter crash on 1 August 2005, three weeks after being sworn in.[87] This resulted in riots, but the peace was eventually re-established[88] and allowed the southerners to vote in a referendum of independence at the end of the six-year period.[89] On 9 July 2011, following a referendum, the region of Southern Sudan split off from Sudan to form [[South Sudan]].[90]
Since 1968, Sudanese politicians had attempted to create separate factions of "Africans" and "Arabs" in the western area of [[Darfur]], a difficult task as the population were substantially intermarried and could not be distinguished by skin tone.
This internal political instability was aggravated by cross-border conflicts with [[Chad]] and [[Libya]][91] and the 1984–1985 Darfur famine.[92] In 2003, the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] and the [[Sudanese Liberation Army]] –accusing the government of neglecting Darfur and oppressing non-Arabs in favor of Arabs – began an armed insurgency.[93]
Estimates vary of the number of deaths resulting from attacks on the non-Arab/Arabized population by the [[Janjaweed]] militia: the Sudanese government claim that up to 10,000 have been killed in this conflict; the United Nations reported that about 300,000 had died as of 2010,[12] and other reports place the figures at between 200,000 and 400,000.[11] During an interview with [[David Frost]] for the [[Al Jazeera English]] programme [[Frost Over The World]] in June 2008, al-Bashir insisted that no more than 10,000 had died in Darfur.[94]
The Sudanese government had been accused of suppressing information by jailing and killing witnesses since 2004, and tampering with evidence, such as covering up [[Mass grave]].[95][96][97] The Sudanese government has also arrested and harassed journalists, thus limiting the extent of press coverage of the situation in Darfur.[98][99][100][101] While the [[Federal government of the United States]] has described the conflict as [[Genocide]],[102] the UN has not recognized the conflict as such.[103] (see [[International response to the War in Darfur#Declarations of genocide]])
The [[United States Government]] stated in September 2004 "that [[Genocide]] has been committed in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring".[104] On 29 June 2004, U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] met with al-Bashir in Sudan and urged him to make peace with the rebels, end the crisis, and lift restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Darfur.[105] [[Kofi Annan]] met with al-Bashir three days later and demanded that he disarm the Janjaweed.[106]
After fighting stopped in July and August, on 31 August 2006, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706]] which called for a new UN [[Peacekeeping]] force consisting of 17,300 military personnel and 3,300 civilians[107] and named the [[United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur]] (UNAMID).[108] It was intended to have supplanted or supplemented a 7,000-troop [[African Union]] [[African Union Mission in Sudan]].[109] Sudan strongly objected to the resolution and said that it would see the UN forces in the region as "foreign invaders".[110] A day after rejecting the UN forces into Sudan, the Sudanese military launched a major offensive in the region.[111] In March 2007, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] accused Sudan's government of taking part in "gross violations" in Darfur[112] and urged the international community to take urgent action to protect people in Darfur.[113] A high-level technical consultation was held in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia, on 11–12 June 2007, pursuant to the 4 June 2007 letters of the secretary-general and the chairperson of the African Union Commission, which were addressed to al-Bashir.[114] The technical consultations were attended by delegations from the Government of Sudan, the [[African Union]], and the United Nations.[115][116]
In 2009, General [[Martin Luther Agwai]], head of the UNAMID, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remained.
Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset [[South Kordofan]] and [[Blue Nile State]] states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings.
In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.[118] Omar al-Bashir sought the assistance of numerous non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him, he said: "From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], and even [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong.
Chadian President [[Idriss Déby]] visited Khartoum in 2010 and Chad kicked out the Darfuri rebels it had previously supported.
On 26 October 2011, al-Bashir announced that he had supported the rebels that had ousted [[Muammar Gaddafi]].
"The forces which entered [[Tripoli, Libya]], part of their arms and capabilities, were 100% Sudanese," he told the crowd.
The agreement also provided for [[Power sharing]] at the national level: movements that sign the agreement will be entitled to nominate two ministers and two four ministers of state at the federal level and will be able to nominate 20 members to the national legislature.
On 14 July 2008, the Chief Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], alleged that al-Bashir bore [[Command responsibility]] for [[Genocide]], [[Crimes against humanity]], and [[War crime]] that had been committed in Darfur since 2003.
The prosecutor accused al-Bashir of having "masterminded and implemented" a plan to destroy the three main ethnic groups—[[Fur people]], [[Masalit people]], and [[Zaghawa people]]—with a campaign of murder, rape, and [[Deportation]].[22][128] The arrest warrant is supported by [[NATO]], the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], and [[Amnesty International]].[129]
An arrest warrant for al-Bashir was issued on 4 March 2009 by a pre-trial chamber composed of judges [[Akua Kuenyehia]] of [[Ghana]], [[Anita Ušacka]] of [[Latvia]], and [[Sylvia Steiner]] of [[Brazil]][130] indicting him on five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape) and two counts of war crimes ([[War loot]] and intentionally directing attacks against civilians).[23][131] The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide.[24][132] However, Ušacka wrote a [[Dissenting opinion]] arguing that there were "reasonable grounds to believe that Omar Al Bashir has committed the crime of genocide".[132]
Sudan is not a state party to the [[Rome Statute]] establishing the ICC, and thus claims that it does not have to execute the warrant.
However, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593]] (2005) referred Sudan to the ICC, which gives the court [[Jurisdiction]] over international crimes committed in Sudan and obligates Government of Sudan to cooperate with the ICC,[133] and therefore the court, Amnesty International and others insist that Sudan must comply with the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court.[24][134] [[Amnesty International]] stated that al-Bashir must turn himself in to face the charges, and that the Sudanese authorities must detain him and turn him over to the ICC if he refuses.[135]
Al-Bashir was the first sitting [[Head of state]] ever indicted by the ICC.[24] However, the [[Arab League]][136] and the [[African Union]] condemned the warrant.
Following the indictment Al-Bashir visited China,[137] [[Djibouti]],[138][139] Egypt, Ethiopia, [[India]],[140] Libya,[141][142] [[Nigeria]],[143] Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the [[United Arab Emirates]], and several other countries, all of which refused to have him arrested.
ICC member state Chad also refused to arrest al-Bashir during a state visit in July 2010.[144] He was also invited to attend conferences in [[Denmark]][145] and [[Turkey]].[146] On 28 November 2011, following a visit to [[Kenya]], Kenya's High Court Judge Nicholas Ombija ordered the Minister of Internal Security to arrest al-Bashir, "should he set foot in Kenya in the future".[147] In June 2015, while in [[South Africa]] for an [[African Union]] meeting, al-Bashir was prohibited from leaving that country while a court decided whether he should be handed over to the ICC for war crimes.[148] He, nevertheless, was allowed to leave South Africa soon afterward.[149] Luis Moreno Ocampo and Amnesty International claimed that al-Bashir's plane could be intercepted in international airspace.
Sudan announced that the presidential plane would always be escorted by fighter jets of the [[Sudanese Air Force]] to prevent his arrest.
Former president of the [[African Union]] [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] characterized the indictment as a form of terrorism.
He also believed that the warrant is an attempt "by (the west) to recolonize their former colonies".[151] Egypt said, it was "greatly disturbed" by the ICC decision and called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council to defer the arrest warrant.[152] The [[Arab League]] Secretary-General [[Amr Moussa]] expressed that the organization emphasizes its solidarity with Sudan and condemned the warrant for "undermining the unity and stability of Sudan".[153] The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] denounced the warrant as unwarranted and totally unacceptable.
The Sudanese government retaliated against the warrant by expelling a number of international [[Aid agency]], including [[Oxfam]] and [[Mercy Corps]].[157] President Bashir described the aid agencies as thieves who take "99 percent of the budget for humanitarian work themselves, giving the people of Darfur 1 percent" and as spies in the work of foreign regimes.
Al-Bashir was one of the candidates in the [[2010 Sudanese general election]], the first democratic election with multiple political parties participating since the [[1986 Sudanese parliamentary election]].[159][160] It had been suggested that by holding and winning a legitimate presidential elections in 2010, al-Bashir had hoped to evade the ICC's warrant for his arrest.[161] On 26 April, he was officially declared the winner after Sudan's election commission announced he had received 68% of the votes cast in the election.[162] However, [[The New York Times]] noted the voting was "marred by boycotts and reports of intimidation and widespread fraud".[163]
In August 2013, Bashir's plane was blocked from entering Saudi Arabian airspace when Bashir was attempting to attend the inauguration of Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]],[164] whose country is the main supplier of weapons to Sudan.[165]
The ICC issued an additional warrant adding 3 counts of genocide for the [[Ethnic cleansing]] of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes.[139] The new warrant included the court's conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that al-Bashir acted with specific [[Genocidal intent]] in part the Fur, Masalit and [[Zaghawa people]] ethnic groups in the Darfur region.[166] The charges against al-Bashir, in three separate counts, include "genocide by killing", "genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm" and "genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction".[167] The new warrant acted as a supplement to the first, whereby the charges initially brought against al-Bashir all remained in place, but now included the crime of genocide which was initially ruled out, pending appeal.[168]
In 2015, Sudan participated in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia]] [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]],[173] who was deposed during the 2011–2012 [[Yemeni revolution]].[174] [[Reuters]] reported that "The war in Yemen has given Omar Hassan al-Bashir, a skilled political operator who has ruled Sudan for a quarter-century, an opportunity to show wealthy Sunni powers that he can be an asset against Iranian influence – if the price is right."[175]
"Ocampo suggested exposing Bashir had illegal accounts would be enough to turn the Sudanese against him."[177] A [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] allegedly reveals that the Sudanese president had embezzled US$9 billion in state funds, but [[Lloyds Bank]] "insisted it was not aware of any link with Bashir," while a Sudanese government spokesman called the claim "ludicrous" and attacked the motives of the prosecutor.[178] In an interview with the Guardian, al-Bashir said, referring to ICC Prosecutor Ocampo, "The biggest lie was when he said I have $9 billion in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [British] finance minister ...

But skeptics have questioned whether a continental body in the style of [[NASA]] or the [[European Space Agency]] would be affordable.[182]
On 11 April 2019, al-Bashir was removed from his post by the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]][183] after many [[2016 Sudanese protests]] and civil uprisings.[184] He was immediately placed under house arrest pending the formation of a transitional council.[185] At the time of his arrest al-Bashir had been the longest-serving leader of Sudan since the country gained independence in 1956, and was the longest-ruling president of the [[Arab League]].
The army also ordered the arrest of all ministers in al-Bashir's cabinet, dissolved the [[National Legislature (Sudan)]] and formed a [[Transitional Military Council (2019)]], led by his own First Vice President and Defense Minister, Lieutenant General [[Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf]].[183]
On 17 April 2019, al-Bashir was moved from house arrest to Khartoum's [[Kobar Prison]].[186] On 13 May 2019, prosecutors charged al-Bashir with "inciting and participating in" the killing of protesters.[187] A trial for corruption (after $130 million was found in his home)[188] and [[Money laundering]] against al-Bashir started during the following months.[30] On 14 December 2019, he was convicted for money laundering and corruption.
On 5 November 2019, the [[Forces of Freedom and Change]] alliance (FFC), which holds indirect political power during the [[2019 Sudanese transition to democracy]], stated that it had reached a consensus decision in favor of transferring al-Bashir to the ICC after the completion of his corruption and money laundering trial.[30] In the following days, Sudanese transition period Prime Minister [[Abdalla Hamdok]] and [[Sovereignty Council of Sudan]] member [[Siddiq Tawer]] stated that al-Bashir would be transferred to the [[International Criminal Court]].[31][32] On 11 February 2020, Sudan's ruling military council agreed to hand over the ousted al-Bashir to the ICC in [[The Hague]] to face charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur.[192] In October 2020, ICC Chief Prosecutor [[Fatou Bensouda]] and a delegation arrived in Sudan to discuss with the government about Bashir's indictment.
On 26 April 2023, the Sudanese Armed Forces stated that al-Bashir, [[Bakri Hassan Saleh]], [[Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein]] and two other former officials were taken from Kobar Prison to Alia Military Hospital in [[Omdurman]] due to the [[2023 Sudan conflict]] that erupted earlier that month.[194][195] Al-Bashir and other officials were later taken to a hospital at [[Wadi Seidna Air Base]], where they remained until their transfer to a facility in [[Merowe, Sudan]] in September 2024.[196] Al-Bashir is reported to be suffering from heart problems.[197]
