George Herbert Walker Bush[a] (June 12, 1924 – November 30, 2018) was the 41st [[President of the United States]], serving from 1989 to 1993.
A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]], he also served as the 43rd [[Vice president of the United States]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]] from 1981 to 1989 and previously in various other [[Federal government of the United States]].[1]
Born into [[Bush family]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], Bush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].
He attended [[Phillips Academy]] and served as a pilot in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] during [[World War II]] before graduating from [[Yale University]] and moving to [[West Texas]], where he established oil company [[HRG Group]].
Following an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate [[1964 United States Senate election in Texas]], he was elected to represent [[Texas's 7th congressional district]] in 1966.
President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and as [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]] in 1973.
President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]] in 1974 and as the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] in 1976.
Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries]] by Reagan, who then selected Bush as his vice presidential running mate.
In the [[1988 United States presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]].
Bush]] as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[Reunification of Germany]].
He presided over the [[Invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the [[Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] in the latter conflict.
Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
He championed and signed three pieces of bipartisan legislation in 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], the [[Immigration Act of 1990]] and the [[Clean Air Act Amendments]].
He also appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the Supreme Court.
Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following [[Early 1990s recession]], his turnaround on his tax promise, and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post–Cold War political climate.[2]
Bush]], in the [[2000 United States presidential election]] and [[2004 United States presidential election]], the two became the second father–son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]].
His second son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries]].

George Herbert Walker Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]].[3] He was the second son of [[Prescott Bush]] and [[Dorothy Wear Walker Bush]],[4] and a younger brother of [[Prescott Bush Jr.]] His paternal grandfather, [[Samuel P.
Bush]], worked as an executive for a railroad parts company in [[Columbus, Ohio]],[5] while his maternal grandfather and namesake, [[George Herbert Walker]], led [[Wall Street]] investment bank [[W.
The Bush family moved to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], in 1925, and Prescott took a position with W.
Harriman & Co., which later merged into [[Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.]] the following year.[8] Bush spent most of his childhood in Greenwich, at the family vacation home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]],[b] or at his maternal grandparents' plantation in South Carolina.[10]
Because of the family's wealth, Bush was largely unaffected by the [[Great Depression in the United States]].[11] He attended [[Greenwich Country Day School]] from 1929 to 1937 and [[Phillips Academy]], an elite private academy in Massachusetts, from 1937 to 1942.[12] While at Phillips Academy, he served as president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of the varsity baseball and soccer teams.[13]
On his 18th birthday, immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy, he enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] as a [[Naval aviator (United States)]].[14] After a period of training, he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] on June 9, 1943, becoming one of the youngest pilots in the Navy.[15][c] Beginning in 1944, Bush served in the Pacific theater, where he flew a [[Grumman TBM Avenger]], a [[Torpedo bomber]] capable of taking off from aircraft carriers.[20] His squadron was assigned to the [[USS San Jacinto (CVL-30)]] as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname "Skin".[21]
Bush flew his first combat mission in May 1944, bombing Japanese-held [[Wake Island]],[22] and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1, 1944.
During an attack on a Japanese installation in [[Chichijima]], Bush's aircraft successfully attacked several targets but was downed by enemy fire.[19] Though both of Bush's fellow crew members died, Bush successfully bailed out from the aircraft and was rescued by the submarine [[USS Finback (SS-230)]].[23][d] Several of the aviators shot down during the attack were captured and executed, and their livers were [[Chichijima incident]].[24] Bush's survival after such a close brush with death shaped him profoundly, leading him to ask, "Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?"[25] He was later awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)]] for his role in the mission.[26][27]
In early 1945, he was assigned to a new combat squadron, VT-153, where he trained to participate in an [[Operation Downfall]].
Between March and May 1945, he trained in [[Auburn, Maine]], where he and Barbara lived in a small apartment.[28] On September 2, 1945, before any invasion took place, Japan formally surrendered following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].[29] Bush was released from active duty that same month but was not formally discharged from the Navy until October 1955, when he had reached the rank of lieutenant.[19] By the end of his period of active service, Bush had flown 58 missions, completed 128 carrier landings, and recorded 1228 hours of flight time.[30]
Bush met [[Barbara Bush]] at a Christmas dance in Greenwich in December 1941,[31] and, after a period of courtship, they became engaged in December 1943.[32] While Bush was on leave from the Navy, they married in [[Rye, New York]], on January 6, 1945.[33] The Bushes enjoyed a strong marriage, and Barbara would later be a popular First Lady, seen by many as "a kind of national grandmother".[34][e] They had six children: [[George W.
1946), [[Pauline Robinson Bush]] (1949–1953), [[Jeb Bush]] (b.
1953), [[Neil Bush]] (b.
1955), [[Marvin Bush]] (b.
1956), and [[Dorothy Bush Koch]] (b.
Bush enrolled at [[Yale College]], where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four.[14] He was a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and was elected its president.[39] He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two [[College World Series]] as a left-handed first baseman.[40] Like his father, he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad[41] and was initiated into the [[Skull and Bones]] secret society.
He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[42]
After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to [[West Texas]].
Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush's relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the "daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker, two dominant figures in the financial world," but would still allow Bush to "call on their connections if he needed to raise capital."[43] His first position in Texas was an [[Oil field]] equipment salesman[44] for [[Dresser Industries]], which was led by family friend Neil Mallon.[45] While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: [[Odessa, Texas]]; [[Ventura, California]], [[Bakersfield, California]] and [[Compton, California]]; and [[Midland, Texas]].[46] In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of [[Republican (United States)]] candidate [[Dwight D.
That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the [[United States Senate]] as a member of the Republican Party.[47]
With support from Mallon and Bush's uncle, [[George Herbert Walker Jr.]], Bush and John Overbey launched the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company in 1951.[48] In 1953, he co-founded the [[HRG Group]], an oil company that drilled in the [[Permian Basin (North America)]] in Texas.[49] In 1954, he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized in [[Offshore drilling]].[50] Shortly after the subsidiary became independent in 1959, Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to [[Houston]].[51] There, he befriended [[James Baker]], a prominent attorney who later became an important political ally.[52] Bush remained involved with Zapata until the mid-1960s, when he sold his stock in the company for approximately $1 million.[53]
In 1988, [[The Nation]] published an article alleging that Bush worked as an operative of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) during the 1960s; Bush denied this claim.[54]
By the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading [[Democratic Party (United States)]] attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat.
Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right [[John Birch Society]] from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the [[Harris County, Texas]] Republican Party, winning election in February 1963.[55] Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] over the more centrist [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[56]
Yarborough]] in [[1964 United States Senate election in Texas]].[57] Bolstered by superior fundraising, Bush won the Republican primary by defeating former gubernatorial nominee [[Jack Cox (Texas politician)]] in a [[Run-off election]].
In the general election, Bush attacked Yarborough's vote for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which banned racial and gender discrimination in public institutions and many privately owned businesses.
Bush argued that the act unconstitutionally expanded the federal government's powers, but he was privately uncomfortable with the racial politics of opposing the act.[58] He lost the election 56 percent to 44 percent, though he did run well ahead of Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential nominee.[57] Despite the loss, [[The New York Times]] reported that Bush was "rated by political friend and foe alike as the Republicans' best prospect in Texas because of his attractive personal qualities and the strong campaign he put up for the Senate".[59]
In [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections]], Bush ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Texas's 7th congressional district]], a newly redistricted seat in the [[Greater Houston]] area.
Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote.[60] To woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904.[61] His voting record in the House was generally [[Conservatism in the United States]].
He supported the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]]'s [[Vietnamization]] but broke with Republicans on the issue of [[Birth control]], which he supported.
He also voted for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], although it was generally unpopular in his district.[62][63][64][65] In 1968, Bush joined several other Republicans in issuing the party's [[Response to the State of the Union address]]; Bush's part of the address focused on a call for fiscal responsibility.[66]
Though most other Texas Republicans supported [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]], Bush endorsed [[Richard Nixon]], who went on to win the party's nomination.
Nixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the [[1968 United States presidential election]], but he ultimately chose [[Spiro Agnew]] instead.
Bush won re-election to the House unopposed, while Nixon defeated [[Hubert Humphrey]] in the presidential election.[67] In 1970, with President Nixon's support, Bush gave up his seat in the House to [[1970 United States Senate election in Texas]] against Yarborough.
Bush easily won the Republican primary, but Yarborough was defeated by the more centrist [[Lloyd Bentsen]] in the Democratic primary.[68] Ultimately, Bentsen defeated Bush, taking 53.5 percent of the vote.[69]
After the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]].[70] The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the [[Soviet Union]] and China, the two major U.S. rivals in the [[Cold War]].[71] During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China.[72] Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted, in [[Resolution 2758]], to expel the [[Republic of China]] and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971.[73] In the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of [[Yahya Khan]] for waging genocide in [[East Pakistan]] (modern Bangladesh), referring to the "tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated".[74] Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan.[75] In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in [[Vietnam]], Bush was sent by Nixon to convince [[Kurt Waldheim]] of the United States' position.
After Nixon won a landslide victory in the [[1972 United States presidential election]], he appointed Bush as chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).[77][78] In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media.
When Agnew was being investigated for corruption, Bush assisted, at the request of Nixon and Agnew, in pressuring [[John Glenn Beall Jr.]], the [[U.S. Senator from Maryland]], to force his brother, [[George Beall (attorney)]] the [[U.S. Attorney]] in Maryland, to shut down the investigation into Agnew.
During Bush's tenure at the RNC, the [[Watergate scandal]] emerged into public view; the scandal originated from the June 1972 break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] but also involved later efforts to cover up the break-in by Nixon and other members of the White House.[80] Bush initially defended Nixon steadfastly, but as Nixon's complicity became clear he focused more on defending the Republican Party.[62]
Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Bush was considered for the position of vice president, but the appointment instead went to [[Gerald Ford]].[81] After the public release of an [[Nixon White House tapes]] that confirmed that Nixon had plotted to use the CIA to cover up the Watergate break-in, Bush joined other party leaders in urging Nixon to resign.[82] When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Bush noted in his diary that "There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died...
Upon his ascension to the presidency, Ford [[1974 United States vice presidential confirmation]] Bush, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president.
Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller, partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush's 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon; Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor.[84] Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the [[De facto embassy#China and the United States]] in the People's Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China.[85] According to biographer Jon Meacham, Bush's time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States "needed to be visible but not pushy, muscular but not domineering".[86]
In January 1976, Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI), placing him in charge of the CIA.[87] In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the [[Vietnam War]], the CIA's reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations.
Bush was tasked with restoring the agency's morale and public reputation.[88][f] During Bush's year in charge of the CIA, the U.S. national security apparatus actively supported [[Operation Condor]] operations and right-wing [[Military dictatorship]] in [[Latin America–United States relations]].[89][90]
Meanwhile, Ford decided to drop Rockefeller from the ticket for the [[1976 United States presidential election]]; he considered Bush as his running mate, but ultimately chose [[Bob Dole]].[91] In his capacity as DCI, Bush gave national security briefings to [[Jimmy Carter]] both as a presidential candidate and as president-elect.
Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s, Bush became chairman on the executive committee of the [[First International Bank]] in Houston.[93] He also spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University's [[Jesse H.
Jones Graduate School of Business]],[94] continued his membership in the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and joined the [[Trilateral Commission]].
Bush 1980 presidential campaign]] in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[95] In the 1980 Republican primary campaign, Bush faced Ronald Reagan, who was widely regarded as the front-runner, as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole, Senator [[Howard Baker]], Texas Governor [[John Connally]], Congressman [[Phil Crane]], and Congressman [[John B.
Bush's campaign cast him as a youthful, "thinking man's candidate" who would emulate the pragmatic conservatism of President Eisenhower.[97] Amid the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], which brought an end to a period of détente, and the [[Iran hostage crisis]], in which 52 Americans were taken hostage, the campaign highlighted Bush's foreign policy experience.[98] At the outset of the race, Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 [[Iowa caucuses]], making 31 visits to the state.[99] He won a close victory in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%.
After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or "[[The Big Mo]]",[100] and Reagan reorganized his campaign.[101] Partly in response to the Bush campaign's frequent questioning of Reagan's age (Reagan turned 69 in 1980), the Reagan campaign stepped up attacks on Bush, painting him as an elitist who was not truly committed to conservatism.[102] Prior to the [[New Hampshire primary]], Bush and Reagan agreed to a two-person debate, organized by [[The Nashua Telegraph]] but paid for by the Reagan campaign.[101]
As Reagan built up a commanding delegate lead, Bush refused to end his campaign, but the other candidates dropped out of the race.[104] Criticizing his more conservative rival's policy proposals, Bush famously labeled Reagan's [[Supply-side economics]]–influenced plans for massive tax cuts as "[[Reaganomics]]".[105] Though he favored lower taxes, Bush feared that dramatic reductions in taxation would lead to deficits and, in turn, cause inflation.[106]
After Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May, Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race.[107] At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], Reagan made the last-minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan–Ford ticket collapsed.[108] Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign's attacks during the primary campaign, and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush's nomination, Reagan ultimately decided that Bush's popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick.
This approach helped him earn Reagan's trust, easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry.[101] Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers, including Bush's close friend James Baker, who served as Reagan's initial chief of staff.[113] His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President [[Walter Mondale]], who enjoyed a strong relationship with Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members, and by Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the [[Ford administration]].[114] The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[State funeral]], which became a common joke for comedians.
As the [[President of the U.S. Senate]], Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.[101]
On March 30, 1981, while Bush was in Texas, [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan]] and seriously wounded by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] Bush immediately flew back to Washington D.C.; when his plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter to show that the government was still functioning.[101] Bush rejected the idea, fearing that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan's powers and prerogatives.[115] During Reagan's short period of incapacity, Bush presided over Cabinet meetings, met with congressional and foreign leaders, and briefed reporters.
Still, he consistently rejected invoking the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].[116] Bush's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan, who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting.
From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].[117]
Reagan assigned Bush to chair two special task forces, one on [[Deregulation]] and one on international drug smuggling.
The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise to curb the size of the federal government.[101] The Reagan administration's deregulation push strongly impacted broadcasting, finance, resource extraction, and other economic activities, and the administration eliminated numerous government positions.[118] Bush also oversaw the administration's national security crisis management organization, which had traditionally been the responsibility of the [[National Security Advisor (United States)]].[119] In 1983, Bush toured Western Europe as part of the Reagan administration's ultimately successful efforts to convince skeptical [[NATO]] allies to support the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles.[120]
Reagan's approval ratings fell after his first year in office, but they bounced back when the United States began to emerge from recession in 1983.[121] Former vice president Walter Mondale was nominated by the Democratic Party in the [[1984 United States presidential election]].
Down in the polls, Mondale [[1984 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection]] Congresswoman [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate in hopes of galvanizing support for his campaign, thus making Ferraro the first female major party vice presidential nominee in U.S. history.[122] She and Bush squared off in [[United States vice-presidential debate, 1984]].[101] Public opinion polling consistently showed a Reagan lead in the 1984 campaign, and Mondale was unable to shake up the race.[123] In the end, Reagan won re-election, winning 49 of 50 states and receiving 59% of the popular vote to Mondale's 41%.[124]
[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985.
Rejecting the ideological rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors, Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called "[[Glasnost]]" (openness) and "[[Perestroika]]" (restructuring).[125] At the 1987 [[Washington Summit (1987)]], Gorbachev and Reagan signed the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles.[126] The treaty began a new era of trade, openness, and cooperation between the two powers.[127] President Reagan and Secretary of State [[George Shultz]] took the lead in these negotiations, but Bush sat in on many meetings.
Bush did not agree with many of the Reagan policies, but he did tell Gorbachev that he would seek to continue improving relations if he succeeded Reagan.[128] On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as [[Acting President of the United States]] when Reagan underwent surgery to remove [[Polyp (medicine)]] from his [[Large intestine]]; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours.[129]
In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].
The officials had used the proceeds to fund the [[Contras]] rebels in their fight against the leftist [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]].
Instead, the administration used non-appropriated funds from the sales.[101] When news of the affair broke to the media, Bush stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds.[130] Biographer Jon Meacham writes that "no evidence was ever produced proving Bush was aware of the diversion to the contras," but he criticizes Bush's "out of the loop" characterization, writing that the "record is clear that Bush was aware that the United States, in contravention of its own stated policy, was trading arms for hostages".[131] The [[Iran–Contra scandal]], as it became known, did serious damage to the Reagan presidency, raising questions about Reagan's competency.[132] Congress established the [[Tower Commission]] to investigate the scandal, and, at Reagan's request, a panel of federal judges appointed [[Lawrence Walsh]] as a [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel]] charged with investigating the Iran–Contra scandal.[133] The investigations continued after Reagan left office, and, though Bush was never charged with a crime, the Iran–Contra scandal would remain a political liability for him.[134]
On July 3, 1988, the guided missile cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)]] accidentally shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]], killing 290 passengers.[135] Bush, then-vice president, defended his country at the United Nations by arguing that the U.S. attack had been a wartime incident and the crew of Vincennes had acted appropriately to the situation.[136]
Bush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the [[1988 Republican Party presidential primaries]] in October 1987.[101] He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer [[Lee Atwater]], which also included his son, George W.
Bush, and media consultant [[Roger Ailes]].[137] Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president, endorsing a [[Human Life Amendment]] and repudiating his earlier comments on "voodoo economics", Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party.[138] His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate minority leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Representative [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, and Christian [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].[139] Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but privately expressed support for Bush.[140]
Though considered the early front-runner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the [[Iowa caucus]], behind Dole and Robertson.[141] Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.[101] With help from Governor [[John H.
Sununu]] and an effective campaign attacking Dole for raising taxes, Bush overcame an initial polling deficit and won New Hampshire with 39 percent of the vote.[142] After Bush won South Carolina and 16 of the 17 states holding a primary on [[Super Tuesday]], his competitors dropped out of the race.[143]
Known as the "[[Thousand points of light]]" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], [[School prayer]], [[Capital punishment in the United States]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States]].[144] Bush also pledged that he would not raise taxes, stating: "Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again.
No new taxes."[145] Bush [[1988 Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection]] little-known Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of Indiana as his running mate.
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party nominated Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], known for presiding over an economic turnaround in Massachusetts.[147] Leading in the general election polls against Bush, Dukakis ran an ineffective, low-risk campaign.[148] The Bush campaign attacked Dukakis as an unpatriotic liberal extremist and seized on the [[Willie Horton]] case, in which a convicted felon from Massachusetts raped a woman while on a [[Prison furlough]], a program Dukakis supported as governor.
The Bush campaign charged that Dukakis presided over a "[[Revolving door]]" that allowed dangerous convicted felons to leave prison.[149] Dukakis damaged his own campaign with a widely mocked ride in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank and poor performance at the second presidential debate.[150] Bush also attacked Dukakis for opposing a law that would require all students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.[144] The election is widely considered to have had a high level of negative campaigning, though political scientist John Geer has argued that the share of negative ads was in line with previous presidential elections.[151]
Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the [[Electoral College (United States)]], and he took 53.4% of the national popular vote.[152] Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the [[Southern United States]].[153] He became the fourth sitting vice president to be elected president and the first to do so since [[Martin Van Buren]] in [[1836 United States presidential election]] and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[Inauguration of Herbert Hoover]].[101][g] In the concurrent [[1988 United States elections]], Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress.[155]
The [[Totalitarianism]] era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree.
Bush's first major appointment was that of James Baker as Secretary of State.[157] Leadership of the Department of Defense went to [[Dick Cheney]], who had previously served as Gerald Ford's chief of staff and would later serve as vice president under his son George W.
Bush.[158] Jack Kemp joined the administration as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, while [[Elizabeth Dole]], the wife of Bob Dole and a former Secretary of Transportation, became the Secretary of Labor under Bush.[159] Bush retained several Reagan officials, including Secretary of the Treasury [[Nicholas F.
Brady]], Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]], and Secretary of Education [[Lauro Cavazos]].[160] New Hampshire Governor John Sununu, a strong supporter of Bush during the 1988 campaign, became chief of staff.[157] [[Brent Scowcroft]] was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.[161]
Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].
The U.S. was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to avoid undermining further democratic reforms.[164]
Bush and Gorbachev met at the [[Malta Summit]] in December 1989.
Though many on the right remained wary of Gorbachev, Bush came away believing that Gorbachev would negotiate in good faith.[165] For the remainder of his term, Bush sought cooperative relations with Gorbachev, believing he was the key to peace.[166] The primary issue at the Malta Summit was the potential [[Reunification of Germany]].
While Britain and France were wary of a reunified Germany, Bush joined German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] in pushing for German reunification.[167] Bush believed that a reunified Germany would serve American interests.[168] After extensive negotiations, Gorbachev agreed to allow a reunified Germany to be a part of NATO, and Germany officially reunified in October 1990 after paying billions of [[Deutsche Mark]] to Moscow.[169]
The Bush administration mildly protested Gorbachev's suppression of Lithuania's independence movement but took no action to intervene directly.[171] Bush warned independence movements of the disorder that could come with secession from the Soviet Union; in a 1991 address that critics labeled the "[[Chicken Kiev speech]]", he cautioned against "suicidal nationalism".[172] In July 1991, Bush and Gorbachev signed the [[START I]] treaty, in which both countries agreed to cut their strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent.[173]
In August 1991, hard-line Communists launched a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] against Gorbachev; while the coup quickly fell apart, it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government.[174] Later that month, Gorbachev resigned as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered the seizure of Soviet property.
Gorbachev clung to power as the [[President of the Soviet Union]] until December 1991, when the Soviet Union [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]].[175] [[Post-Soviet states]] emerged from the Soviet Union, and of those states, Russia was the largest and most populous.
Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992, declaring a new era of "friendship and partnership".[176] In January 1993, Bush and Yeltsin agreed to [[START II]], which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty.[177]
Through the late 1980s, the U.S. provided aid to [[Manuel Noriega]], the anti-Communist leader of Panama.
Noriega had long-standing ties to United States intelligence agencies, including during Bush's tenure as Director of Central Intelligence, and was also deeply involved in [[Drug trafficking]].[178] In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which [[Guillermo Endara]] had been elected.
Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the [[Panama Canal]] with Noriega still in office.[179] Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises violating prior treaties.[180] After Panamanian forces shot a U.S. serviceman in December 1989, Bush ordered the [[United States invasion of Panama]], known as "Operation Just Cause".
American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and [[Panama City]].
Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[179] Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion "represented a new era in American foreign policy" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the threat of Communism, but rather because it was in the best interests of the United States.[181]
Faced with massive debts and low oil prices in the [[Aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War]], Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to conquer the country of Kuwait, a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border.[182] After [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990, Bush imposed [[Sanctions against Iraq]] on Iraq and assembled a [[Coalition of the Gulf War]] opposed to the invasion.[183] Some in the administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel.[184] [[Robert Gates]] attempted to convince [[Brent Scowcroft]] that Bush should tone down the rhetoric but Bush insisted it was his primary concern to discourage other countries from "unanswered aggression".[185] Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20% of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26% of the world's oil supply.[186]
At Bush's insistence, in November 1990, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by January 15, 1991.[187] Gorbachev's support and China's abstention helped ensure passage of the United Nations resolution.[188] Bush convinced Britain, France, and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq.
Still, he wanted to show that the nation was united behind military action.[191] Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, Congress approved the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]].[190]
In retaliation, Iraq launched [[Scud missile]] at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but most missiles did little damage.
About 300 Americans and approximately 65 soldiers from other coalition nations died during the military action.[192] A ceasefire was arranged on March 3, and the United Nations passed a resolution establishing a [[United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission]] in a demilitarized zone between Kuwait and Iraq.[193] A March 1991 [[Gallup (company)]] poll showed that Bush had an approval rating of 89%, the highest presidential approval rating in the history of Gallup polling.[194] After 1991, the United Nations maintained economic sanctions against Iraq, and the [[United Nations Special Commission]] was assigned to ensure that Iraq did not revive its [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction]].[195]
In 1987, the U.S. and Canada reached a [[Free trade agreement]] that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries.
President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.[196] The Bush administration, along with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] Canadian prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]], spearheaded the negotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) with Mexico.
In addition to lowering tariffs, the proposed treaty would affect patents, copyrights, and trademarks.[197] In 1991, Bush sought [[Fast track authority]], which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment.
Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader [[Dick Gephardt]], both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority.
NAFTA was signed in December 1992, after Bush lost reelection,[198] but President Clinton won ratification of NAFTA in 1993.[199] NAFTA was controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.[200] In 2020, it was replaced entirely by the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]] (USMCA).
The U.S. economy had generally performed well since emerging from [[Early 1980s recession in the United States]], but it slipped into a mild [[Early 1990s recession in the United States]].
The unemployment rate rose from 5.9% in 1989 to a high of 7.8% in mid-1991.[201][202] Large [[United States public debt]], spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989[203] to $220 billion for 1990;[204] the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980.[205] As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs, Bush's well-received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters.[206] Bush's top domestic priority was to end federal budget deficits, which he saw as a liability for the country's long-term economic health and standing in the world.[207] As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts[208] and had pledged not to raise taxes, the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget.[209]
Bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for [[Fiscal year#United States]] 1990, which began in October 1989.
However, both sides knew spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary for the following year's budget to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the [[Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1987.[210] Bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because Federal Reserve Chair [[Alan Greenspan]] refused to lower interest rates and thus stimulate economic growth unless the federal budget deficit was reduced.[211] In a statement released in late June 1990, Bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts, incentives for economic growth, budget process reform, as well as tax increases.[212] To [[Fiscal conservatism]] in the Republican Party, Bush's statement represented a betrayal, and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations.[213]
The compromise additionally included a [[PAYGO]] provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation.[214] House minority whip [[Newt Gingrich]] led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase.[215] Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown.
The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90), enacted on October 27, 1990, dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners.
"Even the strongest person couldn't scale the [[Berlin Wall]] to gain the elusive promise of independence that lay just beyond.
The [[Disability]] had not received legal protections under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and many faced discrimination and segregation by the time Bush took office.
Weicker Jr.]] and [[Tony Coelho]] introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act, which barred employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities.
Though some conservatives opposed the bill due to its costs and potential burdens on businesses, Bush strongly supported it, partly because his son, Neil, had struggled with [[Dyslexia]].
After the bill passed both houses of Congress, Bush signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] into law in July 1990.[218] The act required employers and public accommodations to make "reasonable accommodations" for disabled people while providing an exception when such accommodations imposed an "undue hardship".[219]
Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] later led the congressional passage of a separate civil rights bill designed to facilitate launching employment discrimination lawsuits.[220] In vetoing the bill, Bush argued that it would lead to racial quotas in hiring.[221][222] In November 1991, Bush signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which was largely similar to the bill he had vetoed in the previous year.[220]
In August 1990, Bush signed the [[Ryan White CARE Act]], the largest federally funded program dedicated to assisting persons living with [[AIDS]].[223] Throughout his presidency, the [[AIDS epidemic]] grew dramatically in the U.S. and around the world, and Bush often found himself at odds with AIDS activist groups who criticized him for not placing a high priority on HIV/AIDS research and funding.
Frustrated by the administration's lack of urgency on the issue, [[ACT UP]] dumped the ashes of deceased HIV/AIDS patients on the White House lawn during a viewing of the [[AIDS Quilt]] in 1992.[224] By that time, HIV had become the [[List of causes of death by rate]] in the U.S. for men aged 25–44.[225]
In June 1989, the Bush administration proposed a bill to amend the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]].
Mitchell]], the administration won passage of the amendments over the opposition of business-aligned members of Congress who feared the impact of tougher regulations.[226] The legislation sought to curb [[Acid rain]] and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as [[Sulfur dioxide]],[227] and was the first major update to the Clean Air Act since 1977.[228] Bush also signed the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] in response to the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]].
However, the [[League of Conservation Voters]] criticized some of Bush's other environmental actions, including his opposition to stricter auto-mileage standards.[229]
In his 1989 inaugural address, Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."[230] During his presidency, Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award, a tradition that his presidential successors continued.[231] In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[Volunteerism]].[232] In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands On Network]] to create a new organization, [[Points of Light]].[233]
Bush appointed two justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].
In 1990, Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge, [[David Souter]], to replace liberal icon [[William J.
Brennan Jr.]][234] Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush.[234] In 1991, Bush nominated conservative federal judge [[Clarence Thomas]] to succeed [[Thurgood Marshall]], a long-time liberal stalwart.
Thomas, the former head of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination]] in the Senate, as well as from [[United States pro-choice movement]] and the [[NAACP]].
His nomination faced another difficulty when [[Anita Hill]] accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC.
Bush's education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children.[237] Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including [[Goals 2000]] and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].[238] Bush signed the [[Immigration Act of 1990]],[239] which led to a 40% increase in legal [[Immigration to the United States]].[240] The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills.[241] In the wake of the [[Savings and loan crisis]], Bush proposed a $50 billion package to rescue the [[Savings and loan association]] industry, and also proposed the creation of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] to regulate the industry.
Congress passed the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989]], which incorporated most of Bush's proposals.[242]
Bush was widely seen as a "pragmatic caretaker" president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts.[243][244][245] A Bush [[Sound bite]], referring to the issue of overarching purpose as "the vision thing", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties.[246][247][248][249][250][251] His ability to gain broad international support for the [[Gulf War]] and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,[252] rousing bipartisan approval,[253] though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy.[254] A New York Times article [[Supermarket scanner moment]] Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket [[Barcode reader]];[255][256] the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was "out of touch".[255]
After the Gulf war concluded in February 1991, his approval rating saw a high of 89%, before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually falling below 50% according to a January 1992 [[Gallup Inc.]] poll.[257][258][259] His sudden drop in his favorability was likely due to the [[Early 1990s recession]], which shifted his image from "conquering hero" to "politician befuddled by economic matters".[260] At the elite level, several commentators and political experts lamented the state of American politics in 1991–1992 and reported the voters were angry.
Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely.[262] As a result, many leading Democrats, including [[Mario Cuomo]], Dick Gephardt, and [[Al Gore]], declined to seek their party's presidential nomination.[263] However, Bush's tax increase angered many conservatives, who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan.[264] He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] in the [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[265] Bush fended off Buchanan's challenge and won his party's nomination at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]].
Still, the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the [[Christian right]].[266]
Meanwhile, the Democrats nominated Governor [[Bill Clinton]] of Arkansas.
A moderate who was affiliated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), Clinton favored welfare reform, deficit reduction, and a tax cut for the middle class.[267] In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[H.
Clinton won the election, taking 43% of the popular vote and 370 electoral votes, while Bush won 37.5% of the popular vote and 168 electoral votes.[271] Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections]] in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls.[272] Clinton performed well in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast, while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the 1976 election.[273] Several factors were important in Bush's defeat.
In December 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former senior government officials implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].[280] The charges against the six were that they lied to or withheld information from Congress.
According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], the 1992 election had several unique characteristics.
After leaving office, Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of [[West Oaks, Houston]].[283] He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on [[Memorial Drive (Houston)]] in Houston.[284] He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, took annual cruises in Greece, went on fishing trips in Florida, and visited the [[Bohemian Club]] in Northern California.
He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and was an adviser to [[The Carlyle Group]], a private equity firm.[285] He never published his memoirs, but he and Brent Scowcroft co-wrote [[A World Transformed]], a 1998 work on foreign policy.
Bush and [[All the Best (book)]].[286]
During a 1993 visit to Kuwait, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot directed by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]].
President Clinton retaliated when he ordered the [[1993 cruise missile strikes on Iraq]] of 23 [[Cruise missile]] at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in [[Baghdad]].[287] Bush did not publicly comment on the assassination attempt or the missile strike, but privately spoke with Clinton shortly before the strike took place.[288]
In the [[1994 United States gubernatorial elections]], his sons George W.
and Jeb concurrently ran for [[Governor of Texas]] and [[Governor of Florida]].
won his race against [[Ann Richards]] while Jeb lost to [[Lawton Chiles]].
It marked the second time in United States history that a pair of brothers served simultaneously as governors (the first of which spanned from 1967 to 1971, when [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and brother [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] were governors of [[New York (state)]] and [[Arkansas]] respectively).[291]
Bush supported his son's candidacy in the [[2000 United States presidential election]] but did not actively campaign in the election and did not deliver a speech at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].[292] George W.
Bush and his son thus became the second father–son pair to each serve as President of the United States, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]].[293] Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election, the need to distinguish between them has made [[Retronym]] forms such as "George H.
Bush" and "George Bush Sr." and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" more common.[294] Bush advised his son on some personnel choices, approving of the selection of Dick Cheney as running mate and the retention of [[George Tenet]] as CIA Director.
In his retirement, Bush used the public spotlight to support various charities.[297] Despite earlier political differences with Bill Clinton, the two former presidents eventually became friends.[298] They appeared together in television ads, encouraging aid for victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]].[299] However, when interviewed by Jon Meacham, Bush criticized Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and even his son George W.
Bush for their handling of foreign policy after the [[September 11 attacks]].[300]
Bush supported Republican [[John McCain]] in the 2008 presidential election,[301] and Republican [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 presidential election,[302] but both were defeated by Democrat [[Barack Obama]].
In 2011, Obama awarded Bush with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honor in the United States.[303]
Bush supported his son Jeb's bid in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[304] Jeb Bush's campaign struggled, however, and he withdrew from the race during the primaries.
Bush endorsed the eventual Republican nominee, [[Donald Trump]];[305] all three Bushes emerged as frequent critics of Trump's policies and speaking style, while Trump frequently criticized George W.
later said he voted for the Democratic nominee, [[Hillary Clinton]], in the general election.[306] After the election, Bush wrote a letter to President-elect Donald Trump in January 2017 to inform him that because of his poor health, he would not be able to attend [[First inauguration of Donald Trump]] on January 20; he gave him his best wishes.[307]
In August 2017, after the violence at [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], both presidents Bush released a joint statement saying, "America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms[.
Her funeral was held at [[St. Martin's Episcopal Church (Houston)]] in Houston four days later.[311][312] Bush, along with former presidents Barack Obama, George W.
Bush (son), Bill Clinton and First Ladies [[Melania Trump]], [[Michelle Obama]], [[Laura Bush]] (daughter-in-law) and Hillary Clinton attended the funeral and posed together for a photo as a sign of unity.[313][314]
After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush [[Death and state funeral of George H.
Bush]] in Houston on November 30, 2018, at the age of 94.[316][317] At the time of his death he was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age]] until March 22, 2019, when [[Jimmy Carter]] surpassed his lifespan.[318][319] He was also the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age]].[h] Bush [[Lying in state#United States]] in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]] from December 3 through December 5; he was the 12th U.S. president to be accorded this honor.[321][322] Then, on December 5, Bush's casket was transferred from the Capitol rotunda to [[Washington National Cathedral]] where a state funeral was held.[323] After the funeral, Bush's body was transported to George H.W. Bush Presidential Library in [[College Station, Texas]], where he was buried next to his wife Barbara and daughter Robin.[324] At the funeral, former president George W.
In May 1991, The New York Times revealed that Bush had developed [[Graves' disease]], a non-contagious [[Thyroid]] condition that his wife Barbara also had.[325] Bush had two separate hip replacement surgeries in 2000 and 2007.[326] Thereafter, Bush started to experience weakness in his legs, which was attributed to vascular [[Parkinsonism]], a form of Parkinson's disease.
Bush was a lifelong [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] and a member of St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston.
As President, Bush regularly attended services at [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square]] in Washington D.C.[328] He cited various moments in his life on the deepening of his faith, including his escape from Japanese forces in 1944, and the death of his three-year-old daughter Robin in 1953.[329] His faith was reflected in his "thousand points of light" speech, his support for prayer in schools, and his support for the [[Anti-abortion movements]] (following his election as vice president).[330][329] Shortly after his death, it was revealed that Bush secretly [[Child sponsorship]] the education and food expenses of a schoolboy from the Philippines under the assumed name "George Walker" through the charity [[Compassion International]].[331][332]
Polls of historians and political scientists have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] Bush in the top half of presidents.
A 2018 poll of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Bush as the 17th best president out of 44.[333] A 2017 [[C-SPAN]] poll of historians also ranked Bush as the 20th best president out of 43.[334] Richard Rose described Bush as a "guardian" president, and many other historians and political scientists have similarly described Bush as a passive, hands-off president who was "largely content with things as they were".[335] Professor Steven Knott writes that "[g]enerally the Bush presidency is viewed as successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs."[336]
In 2018, [[Vox (website)]] highlighted Bush for his "pragmatism" as a moderate Republican president by working across the aisle.[340] They specifically noted Bush's accomplishments within the domestic policy by making [[Bipartisanship]] deals, including raising the tax budget among the wealthy with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
Bush also helped pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which The New York Times described as "the most sweeping anti-discrimination law since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[341] In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Bush built another bipartisan coalition to strengthen the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.[342][343] Bush also championed and signed into a law the Immigration Act of 1990, a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform act that made it easier for immigrants to legally enter the county, while also granting immigrants fleeing violence the temporary protected status visa, as well as lifted the pre-naturalization English testing process, and finally "eliminated the exclusion of homosexuals under what Congress now deemed the medically unsound classification of 'sexual deviant' that was included in the [[Immigration Act of 1965]]."[344][345] Bush stated, "Immigration is not just a link to our past but it's also a bridge to America's future".[346]
According to [[USA Today]], the legacy of Bush's presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait and by his presiding over the dissolution of the Soviet Union and [[German reunification]].[347] [[Michael Beschloss]] and [[Strobe Talbott]] praise Bush's handling of the Soviet Union, especially how he prodded Gorbachev in terms of releasing control over the [[Satellite state]] and permitting German unification—and especially a united Germany in NATO.[348] [[Andrew Bacevich]] judges the Bush administration as "morally obtuse" in the light of its "business-as-usual" attitude towards China after the massacre in [[Tiananmen Square]] and its uncritical support of Gorbachev as the Soviet Union disintegrated.[349] David Rothkopf argues:
However, [[Time (magazine)]] has criticized Bush's [[Domestic policies]] involving "drugs, homelessness, racial hostility, education gaps, [and] issues with the environment", and it argues that these issues in the United States became worse in the 21st century primarily due to Bush setting a poor example and his handling of these concepts during his presidency.[351]
In 1990, [[Time (magazine)]] magazine named him the [[Time Person of the Year]].[352] In 1997, the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]].[353] In 1999, the CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]], was named the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence]] in his honor.[354] In 2011, Bush, an avid golfer, was inducted in the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].[355] The [[USS George H.
Bush]] (CVN-77), the tenth and last [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] [[Supercarrier]] of the United States Navy, was named for Bush.[356][357] Bush is commemorated on a postage stamp that was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] in 2019.[358] In December 2020, the [[United States Mint]] honored Bush with a [[Presidential Dollar]].
The [[George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum]], the tenth U.S. [[Presidential library system]], was completed in 1997.[359] It contains the presidential and vice presidential papers of Bush and the vice presidential papers of Dan Quayle.[360] The library is located on a 90-acre (36 ha) site on the west campus of [[Texas A&M University]] in College Station, Texas.[361] Texas A&M University also hosts the [[Bush School of Government and Public Service]], a graduate [[Public policy school]].[361] In 2012, Phillips Academy also awarded Bush its Alumni Award of Distinction.[362]
