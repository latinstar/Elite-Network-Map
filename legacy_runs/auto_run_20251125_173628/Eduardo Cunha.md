Eduardo Cosentino da Cunha (born 29 September 1958), is a Brazilian politician and radio host, born in [[Rio de Janeiro]].
He was [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]] from February 2015 until 5 May 2016, when he was removed from the position by the Supreme Court.
[[BBC News]] labeled him the "nemesis" of Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]].[4]
He was indicted in the scandal known as [[Operation Car Wash]] (Portuguese: Operação Lava Jato) involving the state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]] and other corporations.[5] Cunha was suspended as speaker of the Chamber of Deputies by the Supreme Court on the request of the Prosecutor-General due to allegations that he had attempted to intimidate members of Congress and obstructed investigations into his alleged bribe-taking.[6][7][8] Cunha resigned from his position later, on 7 July 2016, after a disciplinary process in Congress that had lasted nine months, making it the longest in Brazilian Congressional history.[9]
A series of legal manoeuvres had stalled the process and kept Cunha in charge of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]].
On 19 October 2016, Cunha was arrested by the [[Brazilian Federal Police]],[11] accused of hiding approximately US$40 million worth of bribes in secret bank accounts[12] and on trying to tamper with investigations against him.[13]
As his mother descended from Italian immigrants from the town of [[Castelluccio Inferiore]] in the region of [[Basilicata]], he also holds Italian citizenship.[14] When he was 14 years old, he began working part-time as an insurance broker.
Later, he worked as an auditor at the firm [[Arthur Andersen]], from 1978 to 1980.
He majored in economics at the [[Universidade Candido Mendes]], and served as an economist at [[Xerox]] of Brazil, between 1980 and 1982.[15]
He is currently married to journalist [[Cláudia Cruz]].
Eduardo Cunha is a conservative [[Evangelicalism]].
As an evangelist, Cunha has proposed legislation titled The Law of [[Heterophobia]] (in response to the Law of [[Homophobia]]).
His first contact with politics was working on the campaigns of Eliseu Resende [pt], a candidate for state government[clarification needed] with the Social Democratic Party (PDS) in the 1982 election, and [[Moreira Franco]], a PMDB candidate for Rio de Janeiro government[clarification needed], in the 1986 election.[15]  When [[Anthony Garotinho]] was elected Governor of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]] in 1999, he appointed Francisco Silva as Secretary of Housing with Cunha as his deputy.
However, Cunha was in office for just over six months, when he was forced to resign due to allegations of irregularities in no-bid contracts and favoring shell companies.[18] Then in 2001, the [[Court of Audit]] confirmed that there were indeed various irregularities in the bids of these [[Shell company]], including the adulteration of the clearance certificate from state taxes.[18]
With Garotinho's support, in 2001 Cunha assumed a vacant state representative's seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro]] (ALERJ), which guaranteed him immunity against the public prosecutor's investigations.
Cunha joined the Brazilian [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] on 1 February 2003, representing [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]].
He was re-elected in 2010 through the PMDB with 150,616 votes.[19] To the [[Superior Electoral Court]] (Brazilian Election Commission), Cunha reported receiving R$4.76 million in donations for the 2010 campaign, of which R$500,000 came from the construction company [[Camargo Corrêa]].[20]
In 2013, Cunha was elected leader of the [[PMDB]] in the House.
The following year, he filed a complaint with the [[Supreme Federal Court]] against now-Congressman [[Anthony Garotinho]] (PR-RJ) for libel and defamation.
Still, later that year, he was re-elected for another term, obtaining 232,708 votes (the third-most votes received in the [[State of Rio de Janeiro]]).[19]
Cunha was indicted in [[Operation Car Wash]] (Operação Lava Jato), the [[Scandal]] involving state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]].
Prosecutors say he "took as much as US$40 million in bribes for himself and his allies, plundering Petrobras, the government-controlled oil company, while laundering money through an evangelical megachurch."[5] On these charges, prosecutors requested "a potential sentence of 184 years in prison".[5] During this period, Cunha led the movement to impeach President [[Dilma Rousseff]] for  manipulating figures in government accounts.
Cunha was arrested on 19 October 2016 in [[Brasília]] and sent to the Complexo Médico Penal de Pinhais, a prison in the [[Curitiba]] metropolitan area, to await trial.[22] Ordering preventive detention, federal judge [[Sergio Moro]] cited risks to "public order, as well as a concrete possibility of flight given his access to hidden resources abroad", and also his dual nationality.[23] On 30 March 2017, he found him guilty of corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering related to the [[Operation Car Wash]] scheme, and sentenced him to 15 years and 4 months in prison.[24][25] A federal court decided 18 July 2017 that Cunha should remain in jail in connection with separate bribery charges related to Fund for the Guarantee of the Time of Service (FI-FGTS), linked to [[Caixa Econômica Federal]].[26]
In addition, Cunha is the respondent in civil proceedings over alleged  "illicit advantages" he gave favored contractors in Petrobrás contract bidding.[27] Cunha had previously faced charges of living rent-free in an apartment owned by a money-dealer, embezzlement and laundering money through his megachurch.[28] In May 2017, according to recordings obtained by [[O Globo]], Brazilian President [[Michel Temer]] instructed [[Joesley Batista]] of the meatpacking conglomerate [[JBS S.A.]] to continue making payoffs to Cunha.[29] Batista allegedly recorded the conversation as part of a plea bargain.[30][31] As of July 2017, the Brazilian justice system still had not identified the owners of eleven offshore accounts that together received $4 million US from José Henriques in connection with the purchase of an oilfield in Benin.
