The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), commonly known as Freddie Mac, is an American [[Publicly traded]], [[Government-sponsored enterprise]] (GSE), headquartered in [[Tysons, Virginia]].[3][4] The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the [[Secondary market]] for [[Mortgage loan]] in the US.
Along with its sister organization, the Federal National Mortgage Association ([[Fannie Mae]]), Freddie Mac buys mortgages, pools them, and sells them as a [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) to private investors on the open market.
This [[Secondary mortgage market]] increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases.
The name "Freddie Mac" is a variant of the FHLMC [[Acronym and initialism]] of the company's full name that was adopted officially for ease of identification.
On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) director [[James B.
Lockhart III]] announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the [[Conservatorship]] of the FHFA (see [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]]).
The action has been described as "one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades".[5][6][7] As of the start of the conservatorship, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] had contracted to acquire US$1 billion in Freddie Mac senior preferred stock, paying at a rate of 10% per year, and the total investment may subsequently rise to as much as US$100 billion.[8] Shares of Freddie Mac stock, however, plummeted to about one [[U.S. dollar]] on September 8, 2008, and dropped a further 50% on June 16, 2010, when the stocks delisted due to falling below minimum share prices for the NYSE.[9] In 2008, the yield on [[United States Treasury security]] rose in anticipation of increased U.S. federal debt.[10] The housing market and economy eventually recovered, making Freddie Mac profitable once again.
Freddie Mac is ranked No. 45 on the 2023 [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, and has $3.208 trillion in assets under management.[11]
From 1938 to 1968, the [[Federal National Mortgage Association]] (Fannie Mae) was the sole institution that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured the value of mortgages by the US government.[12] In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution.
The publicly financed institution was named the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed the repayments of securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (the mortgages themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).[13][14]
Initially, Freddie Mac was owned by the twelve Federal Home Loan Banks and governed by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]].[16]
In 1989, the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989]] ("FIRREA") revised and standardized the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) was abolished and replaced by different and separate entities.
An 18-member board of directors for Freddie Mac was formed, and subjected to oversight by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).
Freddie Mac was put under a [[Conservatorship]] of the [[U.S. federal government]] on Sunday, September 7, 2008.[18]
Freddie Mac's primary method of making money is by charging a guarantee fee on loans that it has purchased and securitized into [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds.
The GSEs are allowed to buy only [[Conforming loan]], which limits secondary market demand for non-conforming loans.
[[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]], now merged into the new [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan in response to the October to October change in mean home price.
Above the conforming loan limit, a mortgage is considered a [[Jumbo loan]].
The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in such high-cost areas as [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], [[Guam]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]],[20] and is also higher for 2–4 unit properties on a graduating scale.
Modifications to these limits were made temporarily to respond to the housing crisis, see [[Jumbo loan]] for recent events.
Smith, 2002 Nobel Laureate in economics, has called FHLMC and FNMA "implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies".[22] [[The Economist]] has referred to "the implicit government guarantee"[23] of FHLMC and FNMA.

As mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBSs), [[Government-sponsored enterprise]] (GSEs) lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators.
Additionally, Freddie Mac was bound by underwriting guidelines, limiting them to only purchasing [[Conforming loan]] that required certain [[Debt-to-income ratio]] and [[Loan-to-value ratio]] ratios, in addition to other metrics.
From 2001 to 2003, [[Financial institution]] experienced high earnings due to an unprecedented re-financing boom brought about by historically low interest rates.
Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, [[Fixed-rate mortgage]] (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in [[Mortgage underwriting]] standards.[26] The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders.
The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance[26] that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages—particularly with adjustable rate mortgages [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]]—caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures.
The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and the [[Federal Reserve System]] took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock.
The PMMS tracks a constant borrower profile of conventional, conforming fully-amortizing home purchase loans with 20% [[Down payment]] and excellent [[Credit score in the United States]] borrowers.[27] Rates are published for the most popular mortgage products, the 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate.
Following challenges using a traditional survey approach, Freddie Mac transitioned to replacing lender survey responses with actual loan application data submitted by lenders to Freddie Mac's [[Mortgage underwriting in the United States]].
Much of the illegal fund raising benefited members of the [[House Financial Services Committee]], a panel whose decisions can affect Freddie Mac.
Notably, Freddie Mac held more than 40 fundraisers for House Financial Services Chairman [[Michael Oxley]] (R-OH).[56]
As of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market.[58] This made both corporations highly susceptible to the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]] of that year.
The [[US Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] took several steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including extending credit limits, granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks), and potentially allowing the Treasury Department to own stock.[59] This event also renewed calls for stronger regulation of GSEs by the government.
The bill was sponsored and introduced in the Senate on January 26, 2005 by Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] (R–NE) and co-sponsored by Senators [[Elizabeth Dole]] (R–NC) and [[John E.
On May 23, 2006, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulator, the [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]], issued the results of a 27-month-long investigation.[61]
Several executives of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac include [[Kenneth Duberstein]], former Chief of Staff to President Reagan, advisor to [[John McCain]]'s [[John McCain 2000 presidential campaign]], and President George W.
Bush's transition team leader (Fannie Mae board member 1998–2007);[65] [[Franklin Raines]], former Budget Director for President Clinton, CEO from 1999 to 2004—statements about his role as an advisor to the Obama presidential campaign have been determined to be false;[66] James Johnson, former aide to Democratic Vice-President Walter Mondale and ex-head of Obama's Vice-Presidential Selection Committee, CEO from 1991 to 1998; and [[Jamie Gorelick]], former Deputy Attorney General to President Clinton, and Vice-Chairman from 1998 to 2003.
Top recipients of PAC money from these organizations include [[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO) $78,500 (total including individuals' contributions $96,950), [[Bob Bennett (politician)]] (R-UT) $71,499 (total $107,999), [[Spencer Bachus]] (R-AL) $70,500 (total $103,300), and [[Kit Bond]] (R-MO) $95,400 (total $64,000).
The following Democrats received mostly individual contributions from employees, rather than PAC money: [[Christopher Dodd]], (D-CT) $116,900 (but also $48,000 from the PACs), [[John Kerry]], (D-MA) $109,000 ($2,000 from PACs), [[Barack Obama]], (D-IL) $120,349 (only $6,000 from the PACs), [[Hillary Clinton]], (D-NY) $68,050 (only $8,000 from PACs).[70] John McCain received $21,550 from these GSEs during this time, mostly individual money.[71] Freddie Mac also contributed $250,000 to the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota according to [[Federal Election Commission]] filings.[72] The organizers of the [[Democratic National Convention]] have not yet submitted their filings on how much they received from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.[72][needs update]
On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) Director James B.
Allison]], former vice chairman of [[Merrill Lynch]], took over Fannie Mae, and [[David M.
On May 8, 2013, Representative [[Scott Garrett]] introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]] into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].
The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as [[Fannie Mae]] and Freddie Mac.[80] The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].[80] The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.[81] These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be.
