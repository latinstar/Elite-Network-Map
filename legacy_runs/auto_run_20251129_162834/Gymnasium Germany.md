Gymnasium (German: [ɡʏmˈnaːzi̯ʊm] ⓘ; German plural: Gymnasien), in the [[German education system]], is the most advanced and highest of the three types of German [[Secondary school]], the others being [[Hauptschule]] (lowest) and [[Realschule]] (middle).[1] Gymnasium strongly emphasizes academic learning, comparable to the British [[Grammar school]] system or with [[University preparatory school]] in the United States.
In 2009/10, 11.1 percent of gymnasium students attended a private gymnasium.[2] These often charge [[Tuition fees]], though many also offer scholarships.
Some gymnasia are [[Boarding school]], while others run as day schools; they are now predominantly co-educational, and few single-sex schools remain.
Students are generally admitted at 10 years of age and are required to have completed four years (six in Berlin and Brandenburg where they are enrolled at the age of 12) of [[Grundschule]] (primary education).
However, in the early 2000s, there was a strong political movement to reduce the time spent at the gymnasium to [[Abitur after twelve years]] throughout Germany; for a short time most pupils throughout Germany attended the gymnasium for 8 years (referred to as G8), dispensing with the traditional ninth year or oberprima (except in Rhineland-Palatinate).
Final year students take the [[Abitur]] final exams.
The first general school system to incorporate the gymnasium emerged in [[Saxony]] in 1528, with the study of [[Greek language]] and [[Latin]] added to the curriculum later; these languages became the foundation of teaching and study in the gymnasium, which then offered a nine-year course.
[[Prussia]] secondary schools only received the title "Gymnasium" in 1918, which for some time would be the only path to university study.[4] Due to the rise of German nationalism in the 1900s,[clarification needed] the Gymnasium's focus on humanism came under attack, causing it to lose prestige.[5] One of the harshest critics was [[Friedrich Lange (journalist)]], who assaulted the school's "excessive humanism" and "aesthetic idealism." He argued that they are not aligned with the aims of patriotism, duty, and the idea of Germanhood and that the country's history could also provide the education and insights offered by the models of classical antiquity.[5] During the [[National Socialism]] era, it became virtually impossible for girls to study at a Gymnasium according to [[Hitler]]'s idea, as stated in [[Mein Kampf]], the education of girls should be conditioned only by the task of motherhood.[4]
The early twentieth century saw an increase in the number of [[Lyceum]] schools for girls, which offered a six-year course.
The rising prominence of girls' gymnasia was mainly due to the ascendancy of the German [[Feminist movement]] in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, corresponding to the rising demand for women's university education.
Today, nearly all German gymnasia, just like nearly all German secondary schools, teach English as a compulsory primary foreign language, with French or [[Latin]] sometimes posing an alternative, though English must usually be taken as a compulsory second foreign language in these cases.
The German State of [[Berlin]], where secondary education normally begins in the seventh year of schooling, has some specialised gymnasia beginning with the fifth year which teach Latin or French as a primary foreign language.
French is the most prevalent choice, followed by Latin, though [[Spanish Language]] has been taking over in recent years.
Other options sometimes offered include [[Russian Language]], which used to be more common, [[Ancient Greek]] and Italian.
Although some specialist gymnasia have English or French as the language of instruction, most lessons in a typical gymnasium (apart from foreign language courses) are conducted in [[Standard High German]].
Curricula differ from school to school, but generally include [[German language]], [[Mathematics]], [[Informatics (academic field)]]/[[Computer science]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], [[Geography]], [[Arts]] (as well as crafts and design), [[Music]], [[History]], [[Philosophy]], [[Civics]] / citizenship,[8] [[Social science]], and several foreign languages.
This, however, depends on many factors; some states such as Bavaria select their students by elementary grades or by entrance examination, and so do certain specialist schools, like the [[Sächsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Meißen]], in other states.
The focus is on the [[Classical antiquity]] and the civilizations of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]].[citation needed]
Often combined with the Neusprachliches Gymnasium this type of schools have a focus on [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] subjects.
It exists in [[Bavaria]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]].
There are a number of gymnasia for mature students, people who graduated from school, but did not receive an [[Abitur]].
Examples are the [[Abendgymnasium]], the [[Aufbaugymnasium]] and the [[Wirtschaftsgymnasium]].
"Herr [[Studienrat]]." This is generally outdated.
To many traditionally minded Germans, a "gymnasium in the [[Southern Germany]]" is the epitome of a good education,[citation needed] while to other Germans, it is the epitome of outmoded traditions and [[Elitism]].[citation needed]
The students who did worst came from [[Hamburg]] and the students who did best came from [[Baden-Württemberg]].
According to the study, the final year students in [[Hamburg]] lagged two years behind those attending a gymnasium in [[Baden-Württemberg]].
Students from all grades are required to take [[Physical education]] classes.
Sports often include [[Association football]], [[Badminton]], [[Table tennis]], [[Rowing (sport)]] and [[Field hockey]].
In the summer months, they have the opportunity to enjoy rowing trips or [[Sailing]] and in winter months, they may go [[Skiing]].
A school "Förderverein" ([[Booster club]]) pays for those wishing to attend, but unable to afford the fee.
Most traditional among these (sports excepted) are [[Drama]], [[Journalism]] (i.
producing a Schülerzeitung) and [[Choir]].
However, [[Chess]], [[Photography]], [[Debating]], [[Improvisational theatre]], [[Environmentalism]], [[Additional Mathematics]], [[Experimental physics]], [[Information technology]], etc.
In case of the [[Ludwig Meyn]] Gymnasium in [[Uetersen]], for example, in 1920:
After the [[Machtergreifung]] of the Nazis, the gymnasium cap was banned for political reasons.
Literature describing student caps was burned.[citation needed] Students received new clothing from the [[League of German Girls]] and the [[Hitler Youth]].
However, the systems of teacher education differ among the [[States of Germany]], include exceptions and are often modified.
Any qualified child can enter the lottery, regardless of previous school performance (see: [[Education in Berlin]]).
Of the private gymnasia, the vast majority is run by the Catholic Church on very low tuition fees (which is more easy as by [[Concordat]], the Church receives a high percentage of the amount of money the State need not spend for a pupil in a Church-school); fees for schools who need to earn money by teaching are higher.
This is less than what was spent on a student attending [[Hauptschule]], but more than was spent on those attending [[Realschule]].[22] Some [[Hauptschule]] and [[Gesamtschule]] students have special needs requiring extra help, so those schools cannot operate as cost-effectively as gymnasia.
A study done in [[Baden-Württemberg]] revealed that 85.9% of students attending a gymnasium were ethnic Germans.[27] Thus the gymnasium is the German school with the most homogenous student body.
According to [[Der Spiegel]] magazine, some minority students were denied a letter of recommendation for entrance to a gymnasium by their teachers simply because they were immigrants.
There have been calls for the abolition of the gymnasium and a switch-over to [[Comprehensive school]].[30] Others want the gymnasia to target more children from poor backgrounds.[31]
The [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] revealed that working-class children needed to achieve higher reading scores than middle-class children in order to get letters of recommendation for entrance into the gymnasium.
According to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]], students from ethnic German families were 4.96 times more likely than children from immigrant families to have their teacher write a letter of recommendation.
According to the [[PISA]] study, competency was linked to social class.
The [[LifE Study]] done by Helmut Fend and others revealed that gymnasium may not matter as much as is generally perceived.
A 1999 study revealed 10th graders attending a normal gymnasium and 10th graders attending a [[Realschule]] had higher IQs than 10th graders attending a comprehensive.
A study revealed that college-bound students attending a traditional gymnasium did better on the [[TOEFL]] than college-bound students attending a comprehensive, but those did better than college-bound students attending an "[[Aufbaugymnasium]]," "Technisches Gymnasium" or "[[Wirtschaftsgymnasium]]" (the last three schools serve students, who graduated from another school receiving no [[Abitur]] and give them the opportunity to earn the Abitur).
They also point out that some comprehensives (such as the "[[Laborschule Bielefeld]]" and the "[[Helene-Lange-School (Wiesbaden)]]" in Wiesbaden) ranked among Germany's best schools.
Germany's [[The Left (Germany)]] introduced a discussion concerning [[Affirmative action]].
Kids from [[Neukölln]] [a poor neighbourhood] would not feel good about themselves if they had to attend a type of school that mainly serves students from social classes different from their own.
In 2009, the [[Senate of Berlin]] decided that Berlin's gymnasium should no longer be allowed to handpick all of their students.
It is hoped that this policy will increase the number of working-class students attending gymnasium.[51] [[The Left (Germany)]] proposed that Berlin gymnasia should no longer be allowed to expel students who perform poorly, so that the students who won a gymnasium place in the lottery have a fair chance of graduating from that school.[51] It is not clear yet whether the Berlin Senate will decide in favour of The Left Party's proposal.
