Al Jazeera Media Network (AJMN; [[Arabic language]]: الجزيرة, [[Romanization of Arabic]]: Al-Jazīrah [æl (d)ʒæˈziːrɐ], lit.
'The Island' or 'The [[Arabian Peninsula]]') is a private-media [[Media conglomerate]] headquartered in [[Wadi Al Sail]], [[Doha]],[3][4] funded in part by the government of [[Qatar]].
The network's flagship channels include [[Al Jazeera Arabic]] and [[Al Jazeera English]], which provide coverage of regional and international news, along with analysis, documentaries, and talk shows.
In addition to its television channels, Al Jazeera has expanded its digital presence with platforms such as [[AJ+]], catering to younger audiences with formats and content tailored for online consumption.
Originally conceived as a satellite TV channel delivering Arabic news and [[Current affairs (news format)]], it has since evolved into a multifaceted media network encompassing various platforms such as online, specialized [[Television channel]] in numerous languages, and more.
The network's news operation currently has 70 [[News bureau]] around the world that are shared between the network's channels and operations, making it one of the largest collections of bureaus among media companies globally.[7]
While critics often view Al Jazeera Arabic as being influenced by [[Foreign relations of Qatar]], Al Jazeera English is seen as editorially independent.[9] The network has often been targeted by foreign governments upset with its reporting.[10][11][12] During the [[Qatar diplomatic crisis]], several Arab countries severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a blockade.
The original Al Jazeera Satellite Channel (then called JSC or Jazeera Satellite Channel) was launched on 1 November 1996.[15] The creation of the new Arabic news network followed the closure of the first [[BBC Arabic Television]] language television station, then a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]], owned by Saudi King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia]]'s cousin, [[Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud]].
The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to thwart a documentary pertaining to [[Executions under sharia law]].[16]
The founder of Al Jazeera News Network is [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]], the [[Emir of Qatar]] and head of the [[House of Thani]].[17] The [[List of emirs of Qatar]], Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal]] 500 million ($137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as [[Hugh Miles (journalist)]] detailed in his book Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West.
It offered six hours of programming per day which would increase to [[12-hour clock]] by the end of 1997.
1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of [[24-hour clock]] broadcasting.[18] Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaus at a dozen sites as far as EU and [[Russia]].
Al Jazeera covered the [[Arab Spring]] more than any other news outlets and had a significant role in spreading the [[Arab Spring]].[19] Al Jazeera was the leading media spreading the news about unrest in a small city in [[Tunisia]] throughout the Middle East in 2011.[20]
People in the Middle East have heavily relied on Al Jazeera to obtain news about their regions and the world even more than [[YouTube]] and [[Google Search]].[20] [[Hillary Clinton]], who at the time of the [[Arab Spring]] was the [[United States Secretary of State]] stated that Al Jazeera "has been the leader in that [it is] literally changing people’s minds and attitudes.
The news of unrest in the Arab states was broadcast by Al Jazeera in Arabic for the [[Arab world]] as well as in English for the audiences from the rest of the world.[19]
In Tunisia, the [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] regime banned Al Jazeera from operating in the country, but with the help of [[Facebook]] users inside Tunisia, Al Jazeera was able to access reports from the events such as protests and government crackdowns that were taking place inside the country.[19] The intensive media coverage of people's uprising against their leaders by Al Jazeera mobilized more people from other parts of the country to join the revolution.[19]
The population in other Arab countries such as [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Yemen]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]] also mobilized against their governments influenced by the Tunisian's successful revolt which was extensively covered by Al Jazeera in [[Modern Standard Arabic]].[19] The international opinion also came to support the Arab movements in the [[Middle East]] since Al Jazeera English covered and reported governmental human right abuses against political activists and even ordinary citizens in the [[Middle East]].[19]
[[Wadah Khanfar]], then the managing director of the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the Director-General of the Al Jazeera Network.
Noted for its journalistic professionalism, especially when contrasted with other Arab news organizations,[25] Al Jazeera gained popularity in the Arab world as an alternative to the previous landscape of largely local state-owned broadcasters,[26] with its early coverage being openly critical of autocratic leaders in the region, as well as hosting a wide range of viewpoints,[27] gaining credibility through its extensive frontline coverage of the [[Second Intifada]] and the [[Iraq War]].[28] Al Jazeera Arabic is editorially independent from [[Al Jazeera English]].[29][30][27] While the news network insists on its editorial independence the network is widely seen by foreign governments as a soft power tool for Qatar.[31]
Al Jazeera English (AJE) was launched on November 15, 2006, as the English-language counterpart to [[Al Jazeera Arabic]].
It positions itself as an alternative media platform to the dominance of Western media outlets like [[CNN]] and [[BBC]], focusing on narrative reporting where subjects present their own stories.[32] Al Jazeera is known for its in-depth and frontline reporting particularly in conflict zones[33][34] such as the [[Arab Spring]], the [[Gaza–Israel conflict]] and others.[35][36][34][37] Al Jazeera's coverage of the Arab Spring won the network numerous awards, including the [[Peabody Award]].[33][38]
In 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was [[Afshin Rattansi]],[40] from the BBC's [[Today Programme]] programme.
However, twelve hours after the launch of the website, "Al Jazeera Net" was kept offline due to many [[Denial-of-service attack]] attacks.
Over twenty-four hours later, "Al Jazeera Net" came back online however, Freedom Cyber Force Militia hacked the website to redirect web browsers to a picture of the [[Flag of the United States]] with a slogan saying "Let Freedom Ring".
On 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called [[Al Jazeera International]].[43] The new channel started at 12h [[GMT]] on 15 November 2006 under the name [[Al Jazeera English]] and launched with broadcast centers in [[Doha]] (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Washington D.C.]] Initially, 12 hours of news a day were broadcast from Doha, and the rest of the day's output was split equally between London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C. Among its staff were journalists hired from [[American Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Nightline]] and other top news outfits.
Josh Rushing,[44] a former media handler for [[CENTCOM]] during the [[Iraq]] war, agreed to provide commentary; [[David Frost]] was also on board.[45][46]
In February 2011, the [[Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey]] put [[Cine5]] up for sale[51] after the channel was confiscated when the owner Erol Aksoy went in debt and became bankrupt.[52] Al Jazeera made a bid for the network[53] and acquired it for $40.5 million after an unsuccessful $21 million bid.[54] Al Jazeera then renamed the channel and worked on launching a Turkish language Al Jazeera operation.[55]
In April 2012, there were reports of the channel being delayed over its refusal to call the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) as terrorists, despite it being [[List of designated terrorist groups]] by many countries and supranational organisations including but not limited to [[Turkey]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], citing journalistic standards.
The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)]], who advocated the project, became at odds with the channel.
In 2013 they announced the creation of Al Jazeera Türk, a version of Al Jazeera in the [[Turkish language]] language(s), stationed in Istanbul, and catering to and broadcasting around Turkey.
The channel launched on 20 August 2013 exclusively on cable and satellite systems in the [[United States]].[citation needed]
On 2 January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it purchased [[Current TV]] from its founders [[Al Gore]], [[Joel Hyatt]], and [[Ronald Burkle]], in the United States and would be launching an American news channel.
Though Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite TV, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time.[61] The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed [[Time Warner Cable]] to drop the network due to its low ratings, but released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers.[62][63][64][65][66] The channel was later added to Time Warner and [[Bright House Networks]] lineups after a new carriage deal was agreed upon.
Al Jazeera Media Network also has a digital online-only news channel [[AJ+]].
The channel is an online and mobile-only news channel primarily found on various social media networks and [[YouTube]] and operated by Al Jazeera New Media out of [[Washington, D.C.]] (previously [[San Francisco, California]]).
It soft-launched on 13 June 2014 with a new webpage, [[Facebook]] page and videos on [[YouTube]].
The full channel launched with an app on 15 September 2014.[69] There are also [[Arabic]] and [[Spanish language]] versions of the channel.
In 2004 Al Jazeera expanded into the world of sports with the establishment of [[Aljazeera Sport]] (now known as [[BeIN Sports]]) and the building of 8 Arabic language specialty sports channels.
On 1 January 2014, Al Jazeera Sport was renamed to [[BeIN Sports]] after it along with all of the organisation's non-[[News media]] and [[Current affairs (news format)]] assets were [[Corporate spin-off]] and [[Privatization]] into [[BeIN Media Group]]; the channels were legally spun off to have consistency with all the Network's sports properties[clarification needed].
According to [[Kate O'Brian]], President of Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera Sport revenue helped fund the network when it was in operation similar to how [[BBC Worldwide]] helps fund the BBC.[citation needed]
On September 9, 2005, Al Jazeera established a children's division with the launch of [[JeemTV]] (since 2013 it was known as JeemTV).
On January 16, 2009, [[Baraem]] launched, the channel targets an audience of three to seven-year-olds and broadcasts 17 hours a day (6 am to 11 pm Doha time).[citation needed]
On April 1, 2016, both JeemTV and Baraem were acquired by [[BeIN Media Group]] and were made part of [[BeIN Channels Network]].
The network operates [[Aljazeera.com]] which is the main website for the [[Al Jazeera English]], [[Al Jazeera Balkans]] and the former [[Al Jazeera America]] web sites.
On January 1, 2018, Al Jazeera launched a [[Mandarin Chinese]] news website becoming the first Middle Eastern news provider to target the Chinese audience.
The staff of the project is in contact with their audience via Chinese social media like [[Sina Weibo]], Meipai and WeChat.[70]
Later renamed Al Jazeera Podcasts, the network is available via the network's website as well as [[SoundCloud]], Apple Podcasts, [[Stitcher]], [[TuneIn]], and [[IHeartRadio]].
The network is based out of San Francisco alongside AJ+ and is available in English.[71] Jetty debuted with the podcast Closer Than They Appear, a hybrid interview/narrative show hosted by writer [[Carvell Wallace]].
Other podcasts that debuted in 2018 included The Game of Our Lives which uses soccer to explain global economics and cultures, a podcast on freedom dubbed (Freedom Stories, featuring [[Melissa Harris-Perry]]), sex (The Virgie Show) with [[Virgie Tovar]], and global music (Movement) with [[Meklit Hadero]].[72]
The Al Jazeera International Documentary Film Festival is an annual film festival held at the Doha Sheraton in [[Doha, Qatar]].
The Al Jazeera Balkans Documentary Film Festival was started in 2018 as an annual international [[Documentary film]] film festival based in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].[77]
Al Jazeera Media Network also operates Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, an Arabic language documentary channel, [[Al Jazeera Mubasher]], a live politics and public interest channel, which broadcasts conferences in real time without editing or commentary.
In 2017, Al Jazeera signed a strategic partnership agreement with [[Google]].[78] In 2019, Al Jazeera signed a partnership agreement with the [[China Intercontinental Communication Center]] over Al Jazeera's documentary channel with the aim of expanding its documentary content through co-production and exchange of media.[79][80] The same year, Al Jazeera and [[Bloomberg L.P.]] signed a content license agreement.[81] In 2021, Al Jazeera partnered with [[Arewa 24]] to provide its content in [[Hausa language]].[82] In 2023, Al Jazeera partnered with [[Avid Technology]].[83]
Al Jazeera aimed to counter government censorship and the dominant Western viewpoint of Arabs.[85][better source needed] The term, coined by [[Philip Seib]] and possibly used earlier by Simon Henderson, initially referred to Arab governments losing control of information due to Al Jazeera's popularity.
Seib concludes that the new media, while not beyond being abused, are largely contributing to [[Democratization]] and [[Political reform]] worldwide.[86]
AJMN receives public funding from the Qatari government and is [[Articles of association]] as a "[[Private foundation]] [[Public interest law]]" under Qatari law.[89][90] Some scholars and media outlets argued that the government of Qatar has a degree of editorial influence over its content,[91][92] particularly over its Arabic language reporting.[93] However, AJMN maintains that "its reporting is not directed or controlled by the Qatari government nor does it reflect any government viewpoint."[94] While there is evidence supporting Al Jazeera's claims of editorial independence, the network enjoys only relative autonomy: it is not government-controlled, yet it remains government-owned.[95][9]
Critics have argued that its Arabic-language coverage in particular is influenced by [[Foreign relations of Qatar]], often framing events in ways favourable to the government's aims, such as its [[Media coverage of the Iraq War]] and the [[Arab Spring]].[96] It has been alleged that in its domestic Arabic-language coverage, criticism of the ruling Qatari regime is [[Mass media in Qatar#Media censorship]].[97] It's reporting on domestic issues in Qatar regarding the [[House of Thani]] Royal Family and internal Qatari affairs[92]—such as the country's treatment of domestic workers, most recently during the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] games—has also been scrutinized.[98][99]  Other authors have argued that Qatar does not have firm editorial control of Al Jazeera's Arabic coverage and that it largely operates independently, and that its coverage sometimes goes against Qatar's foreign policy.[100] Most sources agree that Al Jazeera's English- language reporting is more objective and independent than its Arabic-language reporting.[101][100] [[Al Jazeera English]] has developed its own internal editorial guidelines and is editorially independent from [[Al Jazeera Arabic]].[29][30][27]
Several Algerian cities lost power on 27 January 1999, reportedly to keep residents from watching a program in which Algerian dissidents implicated the [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces]] in a series of massacres.[102][103][104] On 4 July 2004, the [[Politics of Algeria]] froze the activities of Al Jazeera's Algerian correspondent.
According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], however, the measure was a reprisal for a broadcast the previous week of another Al-Itijah al-Mouakiss debate on the political situation in [[Algeria]].[105]
[[Bahrain]] Information Minister [[Nabeel bin Yaqub Al-Hamar]] banned Al Jazeera correspondents from reporting from inside the country on 10 May 2002, saying that the station was biased towards Israel and against Bahrain.[106] After improvements in [[Bahrain–Qatar relations]] in 2004, Al Jazeera correspondents returned to Bahrain.
Al Jazeera has been banned three times by the [[Iraqi government]], most recently in 2016 where officials accused it of "inciting violence and [[Sectarianism in Iraq]]."[108][109] Iraqi authorities had long perceived Al Jazeera's media coverage as hostile to Iraq's [[Shia Islam]] majority and too friendly toward the [[Islamic State of Iraq]].[110] In 2013, the broadcaster was accused by many Iraqi government supporters of backing Arab spring protests in the country.[111]
The UAE blocked Al Jazeera in the emirates on 5 June 2017 (after the onset of the [[Qatar diplomatic crisis]]) because the organization was a state-endowed entity of the Qatari government and they claimed that Qatar was "a major sponsor of hate speech through Al Jazeera's Arabic-language network and its other state-controlled media entities."[112] In the [[International Court of Justice]] case filed by Qatar against the United Arab Emirates about the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination (Qatar v.
In May 2019, [[Sudan]] closed Al Jazeera's office.
Qatar was seen as a close ally of ousted [[List of heads of state of Sudan]] [[Omar al-Bashir]].[115]
Israel banned Al Jazeera in May 2024, forcing their offices in the country to close.[116] In September 2024, the [[IDF]] ordered the closure of the Al Jazeera Office in [[Ramallah]], considering it a threat to national security.[117] At the start of 2025, the [[Palestinian Authority]] suspended Qatar's Al Jazeera TV broadcasts from The West Bank, claiming it shows "inciting material." Both the culture, interior and communications ministers of the authority were cited by WAFA that the channel broadcast material that was "deceiving and stirring strife."[118]
