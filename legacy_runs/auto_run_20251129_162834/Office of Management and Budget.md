The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest office[a] within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] and is responsible for implementing the [[Mandate (politics)]] across the [[Federal government of the United States]].
In 1921, Congress passed legislation to create the Bureau of the Budget to assist the president in developing his budget to be enacted or rejected by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] of the Constitution.[2] In 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] led the reorganization of the bureau into its current form as the OMB reporting directly to the president.[3]
Most notably, Congress enacted legislation in 1974 to form a congressional counterpart to the OMB, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] along with other laws including to limit presidential [[Impoundment of appropriated funds]].[5][6][7]
[[Russell Vought]] is the current director of the OMB since he was appointed by [[Donald Trump]] in February 2025.
The Bureau of the Budget, OMB's predecessor, was established in 1921 as a part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by the [[Budget and Accounting Act]], which President [[Warren G.
The Bureau of the Budget was moved to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] in 1939 and was run by [[Harold D.
Smith]] during the government's rapid expansion of spending during [[World War II]].
The bureau was reorganized into the Office of Management and Budget in 1970 during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]].[9] The first OMB included [[Roy Ash]] (head), [[Paul H.
O'Neill]] (assistant director), [[Fred Malek]] (deputy director), [[Frank Zarb]] (associate director) and two dozen others.[10]
Six positions within OMB – the director, the deputy director, the deputy director for management, and the administrators of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], the [[Office of Federal Procurement Policy]], and the [[Office of Federal Financial Management]] – are presidentially appointed and [[United States Senate]]-[[Advice and consent]] positions.
They also provide important information to those assigned to the statutory offices within OMB: the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Office of Federal Financial Management, and the [[Office of E-Government & Information Technology]], which specializes in issues such as federal regulations and procurement policy and law.
With respect to the estimation of spending for the [[Executive (government)]], the BRD serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (which was created in response to the OMB) for estimating Congressional spending, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] for estimating executive branch revenue, and the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating Congressional revenue.
The Enrolled Bill Memorandum details the bill's particulars, opinions on the bill from relevant federal departments, and an overall opinion about whether it should be signed into law or [[Veto power in the United States]].
OMB coordinates the development of the president's budget proposal by issuing [[List of OMB Circulars]], memoranda, and guidance documents to the heads of executive agencies.
In July, the OMB issues [[OMB Circular A-11]] to all agencies, which outlines instructions for submitting the budget proposals, which the agencies submit by September.
The [[Fiscal year]] begins October 1 and OMB staff meet with senior agency representatives to find out whether their proposals are in line with the president's priorities and policies and identify constraints within the budget proposal until late November.
Without a budget, federal employees could not be paid, federal buildings could not open and federal programs would come to a halt in a [[Government shutdowns in the United States]] Shutdowns can occur when Congress refuses to pass a budget.[15]
The Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee (ISDC) was created as an OMB committee by President Ronald Reagan's [[List of executive actions by Ronald Reagan]] 12549 in 1986, for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the order.

Circular A-119[18] is for federal participation in the development and use of [[Technical standards]] and in [[Conformance testing]] activities.
A-119 instructs its agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards before relying upon [[Technical standards]] and reducing to a minimum the reliance by agencies on [[Technical standards]].
Adoption of [[International standards]] is widely followed by U.S. agencies.[19] This includes:
