Williamsburg is an [[Independent city (United States)]] in [[Virginia]], United States.
It had a population of 15,425 at the [[2020 United States census]].[6] Located on the [[Virginia Peninsula]], Williamsburg is in the northern part of the [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area.
It is bordered by [[James City County, Virginia]] on the west and south and [[York County, Virginia]] on the east.
In 1632, English settlers founded [[Middle Plantation, Virginia]] as a fortified settlement on high ground between the [[James River]] and [[York River (Virginia)]] rivers and farther inland than their headquarters at [[Jamestown, Virginia]].
It functioned as the capital of the [[Colony of Virginia]] and Commonwealth of Virginia from 1699 to 1780 and became the center of political events in Virginia leading to the [[American Revolution]].
The [[College of William & Mary]], established in Middle Plantation in 1693, is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.
Of the nine [[Colonial colleges]] in the U.S., it is the only one located in the [[Southern United States]].
The city's tourism-based economy is driven by [[Colonial Williamsburg]], the city's restored Historic Area.
Along with nearby [[Jamestown Settlement]] and [[Yorktown, Virginia]], Williamsburg forms part of the [[Historic Triangle]], which annually attracts more than four million tourists.[7] Modern Williamsburg is also a [[College town]], inhabited in large part by William & Mary students, faculty and staff.

Before English settlers arrived at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] to establish the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607, the area that would become Williamsburg formed part of the territory of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]].
By the 1630s, English settlements had grown to dominate the lower (eastern) portion of the [[Virginia Peninsula]], and Powhatan tribes had abandoned their nearby villages.
Between 1630 and 1633, after the war that followed the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], English colonists constructed a defensive palisade across the peninsula and a settlement named [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)]] as a primary guard-station along the palisade.[8]
Jamestown, the original capital of Virginia Colony, burned down during the events of [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in 1676.
Once Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)]] had regained control, temporary government headquarters were established about 12 miles (19 km) away on the high ground at Middle Plantation, pending the rebuilding of the Statehouse at Jamestown.
The members of the [[House of Burgesses]] discovered that the "temporary" location was both safer and more pleasant than Jamestown, which was humid and plagued with mosquitoes.
An early attempt at [[Henricus]] failed after the [[Indian massacre of 1622]]; the location at the outskirts of the developed part of the colony had left it vulnerable to attack.
They commissioned Reverend [[James Blair (clergyman)]], who spent several years in England lobbying, and finally obtained a royal charter for the desired new school.
It was to be named the [[The College of William & Mary]] in honor of the monarchs of the time.
Classes began in temporary quarters in 1694, and construction soon started on the College Building, a precursor to the [[Wren Building]].
A village was laid out and Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in honor of King [[William III of England]], befitting the town's newly elevated status.
After Williamsburg's designation as the colony's capital, immediate provision was made for construction of a capitol building and for platting the city according to [[Theodorick Bland (surveyor)]]'s survey.
His design utilized the college's extant sites and the almost new [[Bruton Parish Church]] as focal points, and placed the new Capitol building opposite the college, with [[Duke of Gloucester Street]] connecting them.
[[Alexander Spotswood]], who arrived in Virginia as [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] in 1710, had several ravines filled and streets leveled, and assisted in erecting additional college buildings, a church, and a magazine for the storage of arms.
In 1722, Williamsburg was granted a [[Royal charter]] as a "city incorporate", which is now believed to be the oldest charter in the United States.[9]
Middle Plantation was included in [[James City Shire]] when it was established in 1634, as the colony reached a total population of approximately 5,000.
(James City and Virginia's other shires changed their names a few years later; James City Shire then became known as [[James City County, Virginia]]).
The middle ground ridge-line was essentially the dividing line with [[Charles River Shire]], which was renamed [[York County, Virginia]] after King [[Charles I of England]] (r.
Williamsburg was the site of the first attempted [[Canal]] in the United States.
In 1771, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], who was Virginia's last [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]], announced plans to connect [[College Creek]], which leads to the [[James River]], with [[Queen's Creek]], leading to the [[York River (Virginia)]].
It would have formed a water route across the [[Virginia Peninsula]], but was not completed.
Remains of this canal are visible at the rear of the grounds behind the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]].[10]
In the 1770s, the first purpose-built [[Psychiatric hospital]] in the United States, the Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds, was founded in the city.
Known in modern times as [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)]], it was established by Act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on June 4, 1770.
The [[Gunpowder Incident]] began in April 1775 as a dispute between Dunmore and Virginia colonists over gunpowder stored in the Williamsburg magazine.
Virginia militia led by [[Patrick Henry]] responded to the "theft" and marched on Williamsburg.
This was an important precursor[citation needed] in the run-up to the [[American Revolution]].
Following the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] from Britain, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in 1776.
During the war, Virginia's capital was moved again, in 1780, this time to [[Richmond, Virginia]] at the urging of then-[[Governor of Virginia]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], who feared Williamsburg's location made it vulnerable to a British attack.
In the 18th and early 19th-century, transportation in the colony was largely by [[Canal]] and navigable [[River]].
The latter became known as [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)]].
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), enlistments in the [[Confederate Army]] depleted the College of William & Mary's student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the war.
The [[Wren Building]] served as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital before being burned by Union forces in 1862.[11][12]
The Williamsburg area saw combat in the spring of 1862 during the [[Peninsula Campaign]], a Union effort to take Richmond from the east from a base at [[Fort Monroe]].[13] Throughout late 1861 and early 1862, the small contingent of Confederate defenders was known as the Army of the Peninsula, led by General [[John B.
In early May 1862, after holding off Union troops for over a month, the defenders withdrew quietly from the [[Warwick Line]] (stretching across the Peninsula between [[Yorktown, Virginia]] and [[Mulberry Island]]).
McClellan]]'s Union forces crept up the Peninsula to pursue the retreating Confederate forces, a rear-guard force led by General [[James Longstreet]] and supported by General [[J.
This was a series of 14 redoubts east of town, with earthen [[Fort Magruder]] (also known as Redoubt # 6) at the crucial junction of the two major roads leading to Williamsburg from the east.
At the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] on May 5, 1862, the defenders succeeded in delaying the Union forces long enough for the retreating Confederates to reach the outer defenses of Richmond.
A siege of Richmond ensued, culminating in the [[Seven Days Battles]] (June to July 1862).
The college's [[Brafferton (building)]] operated for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town.
On September 9, drunken soldiers of the [[5th Pennsylvania Cavalry]] set fire to the College Building,[15] allegedly to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover.
Huntington]]'s [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) built its [[Peninsula Extension]] through the area, eventually establishing six stations in Williamsburg and the surrounding area.
(They were later relocated, and Collis Huntington's real-estate arm, [[Old Dominion Land Company]], donated the site to the forerunner of the [[Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities]].)
The railroad's main purpose was shipping eastbound [[West Virginia]] [[Bituminous coal]] to [[Newport News, Virginia]].
Using the new [[Coal pier]], coal was loaded aboard large [[Collier (ship type)]] in the harbor of [[Hampton Roads]] for shipment to New England and to export destinations worldwide.[17]
Ewell's efforts to restore the school and its programs during and after [[Reconstruction era of the United States]] became legendary in Williamsburg and at the college,[citation needed] and were ultimately successful, with funding both from the U.S. Congress and from the Commonwealth of Virginia.
The location earlier known as Vaiden's Siding on the railroad just west of Williamsburg in [[James City County, Virginia]] was renamed [[Norge, Virginia]].
Some local lore indicates that the residents liked it that way, as described in longtime [[Virginia Peninsula]] journalist, author and historian [[Parke S.
On June 26, 1912, the [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] published an editorial that dubbed Williamsburg "[[Lotophagi]]," for "Tuesday was election day in Williamsburg but nobody remembered it.
But even if such complacency existed, one Episcopal priest dreamed of expanding and changing Williamsburg's future to give it a new major purpose, turning much of it into a massive [[Living museum]].
Goodwin]] of Williamsburg's [[Bruton Parish Church]] championed one of the nation's largest historic restorations.
This he had accomplished by 1907, in time for the 300th anniversary of the founding of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] in Virginia.
Of modest means, he sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully attracting the interest and major financial support of [[Standard Oil]] heir and philanthropist [[John D.
Rockefeller Jr.]] and his wife [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]].
Their combined efforts created [[Colonial Williamsburg]], restoring much of downtown Williamsburg and developing a 301-acre (1.22 km2) Historic Area celebrating the patriots and early history of the colonial-era.
As of 2022[update], Colonial Williamsburg is Virginia's largest tourist attraction by attendance and the cornerstone of the [[Historic Triangle]], with Jamestown and [[Yorktown, Virginia]] joined by the [[Colonial Parkway]].
1908 [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] combination passenger and freight station at [[Norge, Virginia]] was preserved and, with a donation from [[CSX Transportation]], relocated in 2006 to a site at the Williamsburg Regional Library's Croaker Branch.
Other landmarks outside the historic area include [[Carter's Grove]] and [[Gunston Hall]].
In 1932, a [[Catholic Church]] church was built to minister to students at the [[College of William & Mary]].
[[Saint Bede Catholic Church, Williamsburg#National Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham]] was made a [[National shrine]], dedicated to [[Our Lady of Walsingham]].
On October 22, 1976, the third of three debates between Republican President [[Gerald Ford]] and Democratic challenger [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election]] was held at [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]] at the [[College of William & Mary]], during which both candidates, perhaps in tribute to the historic venue and the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebration, spoke of a "new spirit" in America.
The [[9th G7 summit]] took place in Williamsburg in 1983.
The participants discussed the growing debt-crisis, arms control and greater cooperation between the Soviet Union and the [[G7]] (subsequently the G8).
At the end of the meeting, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George P.
On May 3, 2007, Britain's [[Queen Elizabeth II]] visited Jamestown and Williamsburg.[20] She had previously visited Williamsburg in 1957.[21] Many world leaders,[22][citation needed] including President [[George W.
On February 5, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] took his first trip aboard [[Air Force One]] to a [[United States House of Representatives]] Democrats retreat in the city to attend and address their "Issues Conference".[24][25]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 9.1 square miles (23.6 km2), of which 8.9 square miles (23.1 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) (1.8%) is water.[26]
Williamsburg stands upon a ridge on the [[Virginia Peninsula]] between the [[James River]] and [[York River (Virginia)]] Rivers.
[[Queen's Creek]] and [[College Creek]] partly encircle the city.
[[James City County, Virginia]] is to the west and south and [[York County, Virginia]] to the north and east.
The city is on the [[Interstate 64]] corridor, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of [[Richmond, Virginia]] and about 37 miles (60 km) northwest of [[Norfolk, Virginia]].
It is in the northwest corner of [[Hampton Roads]], the nation's [[List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population]] metropolitan area, with a population of 1,576,370.
Within Hampton Roads, Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach [[Virginia Beach Oceanfront]] and Williamsburg are primarily tourism centers.
Williamsburg is in the [[Humid subtropical climate]] zone, with cool to mild winters, and hot, humid summers.
Due to the inland location, winters are slightly cooler and spring days slightly warmer than in Norfolk, though lows average 3.2 °F (1.8 °C) cooler here due to the substantial [[Urban heat island]] to the southeast.
Snowfall averages 4.3 inches (11 cm) per season, and the summer months tend to be slightly wetter.[27] With a period of record dating only back to 1951, extreme temperatures range from −7 °F (−22 °C) on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak]], to 104 °F (40 °C) on August 22, 1983, and June 26, 1952.[28]
During the [[American Revolution]], [[African Americans]] made up over 50% of Williamsburg's population.[33]
Williamsburg was 78% White and 13% Black at the 2000 census,[34] and 71% White and 14% Black at the 2010 census.[35] The 2020 census indicated a dramatic demographic shift in the city, reporting that Williamsburg was 48% White and 37% Black.[3] Census data shows almost all of the Black population growth occurring in [[Census block]] containing [[College of William & Mary]] dorms, but data from the [[State Council of Higher Education for Virginia]] shows no growth in the number of Black students in William & Mary dorms during the 2010s.[36] University of Virginia researchers believe that the high Black population figure was not due to an actual demographic shift but instead due to "the [[United States Census Bureau]]’s decision to swap some census respondents’ identities with other respondents for privacy protection", a phenomenon known as [[Differential privacy]].[36][37]
The [[Population density]] was 1,404.1 people per square mile (542.1 people/km2).
The racial makeup of the city was 74.0% [[White American]], 14.0% [[African American]], 0.3% [[Native Americans in the United States]], 5.7% [[Asian American]], 0.0% [[Pacific Islander American]], 2.5% from [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census#Race]], and 3.5% from [[Multiracial American]].
6.7% of the population were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] of any race.
The [[Per capita income]] for the city was $18,483.
18.3% of the population and 9.3% of families were below the [[Poverty line]].
This is because many retirees relocate to Williamsburg and typically draw income from investments such as [[401(k)]] plans and the like.
Notable among these was [[Anheuser-Busch]], which established large operations in [[James City County, Virginia]] and [[York County, Virginia]] just outside the city.
The company operates a large [[Brewery]] there.
It also used to operate two [[Amusement park]] near the brewery, [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]], and [[Water Country USA]], but both properties were sold to private investors after foreign brewer [[InBev]] took over Anheuser-Busch in 2010.
Anheuser-Busch also previously operated a commerce park, [[McLaw's Circle]], and [[Kingsmill, Virginia]], a gated residential neighborhood that contains a resort of the same name.
Williamsburg has an [[Outlet mall]], [[Williamsburg Premium Outlets]].
A second outlet mall, [[Williamsburg Outlet Mall]], closed in December 2013.
[[Williamsburg Pottery Factory]] also has outlet stores.
Williamsburg is often associated with the larger [[Southern United States]].
People who grew up in the [[Hampton Roads]] area have a unique [[Tidewater accent]] that differs from a stereotypical [[Southern American English]].
Tourist sites include [[Colonial Williamsburg]], a [[Living history]] museum depicting the lifestyles and culture of the 18th-century colonial period.
Within this area is [[Capitol (Williamsburg, Virginia)]], the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)]], [[Bruton Parish Church]] (the oldest continually operating church in the United States), the [[Peyton Randolph House]] (home of Peyton Randolph, the first President of [[Continental Congress]]) and [[The College of William & Mary]].
Other sites include the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, [[The Williamsburg Winery]], the [[Williamsburg Botanical Garden]], the [[National Center for State Courts]] and the [[Virginia Musical Museum]].
Williamsburg has two [[Theme park]], [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] and [[Water Country USA]].
[[Presidents Park (Virginia)]] was an educational attraction that displayed outdoor statue heads and biographies of 43 presidents.[39][40] In 2010, [[Presidents Park (Virginia)]] closed due to financial issues.[41]
Williamsburg is part of [[Virginia's 1st congressional district]], represented by Republican [[Rob Wittman]], who was first elected in 2007.
In 1870, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] changed the boundaries so that it was entirely within James City County.
A year later, a new state constitution created the political entity known as an [[Independent city (United States)]], which is not located in any county.
The city also operates a joint [[School division]] with James City County, under a voluntary agreement that leaders revisit at planned intervals.
As an independent city, Williamsburg has had a [[Council-manager]] form of government since 1932.
The [[City council]] elects the mayor, who presides over council meetings and serves as the city's Chief Elected Official.
It hires a [[City manager]], comparable to a corporation's [[Chief executive officer]], who is usually a professionally trained public administrator and is charged with implementing the council's policies and directives and has broad administrative authority with strict rules prohibiting political interference in administrative matters.[43]
The city now shares all constitutional officers, courts, and the [[Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools]] system (WJCC) with adjacent [[James City County, Virginia]], and is the [[County seat]].[46] Until 1998, the city had its own Sheriff's Office.
As a [[College town]], Williamsburg's large student population has also resulted in a few conflicts with the city government.
If they're living in the dorms for eight months out of the year, and have an address located within the city limits on a Virginia driver's license, they're entitled to register to vote."[50]
In presidential elections, Williamsburg was a [[Republican Party (United States)]]-leaning city for most of the time from the 1950s to the 1980s.
Between 1948 and 1988, it supported a [[Democratic Party (United States)]] presidential nominee only once, in [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[1964 United States presidential election]] over Republican [[Barry Goldwater]].
This changed in the 1990s when Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] won Williamsburg in both of his presidential campaigns.
Due in part to [[Green Party of the United States]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]]'s strong showing as a left-wing protest candidate in the college town, Republican [[George W.
Bush]] secured a very narrow plurality in [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2000]].
Democrat [[John Kerry]] won the city by a single-digit margin over Bush in [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2004]].
Democrat [[Barack Obama]] swept Williamsburg by 29-point margins in both the [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2008]] and [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2012]] elections.
In the [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2016]] election, Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] beat Republican [[Donald Trump]] in Williamsburg by 45 points.
Four years later, the city gave an equally massive victory to [[Joe Biden]], who carried the county with 69% of the vote, the best showing for a Democrat since [[Franklin D.
The city swung even further to the left in 2024, defying national trends, giving [[Kamala Harris]] over 71% of the vote.[51]
The [[Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools]] operates the following schools in Williamsburg: [[Matthew Whaley School]], Berkeley Middle School, James Blair Middle School, [[Lafayette High School (Virginia)]], and [[Warhill High School]].[citation needed]
There are several private schools that also serve the Williamsburg and James City Country area, including [[Williamsburg Christian Academy]], a Christian [[International Baccalaureate]] School, [[Walsingham Academy]], a [[Private school]] [[Catholic school]] serving pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, Williamsburg Montessori School, and Providence Classical School.
The city has been the home to [[The College of William & Mary]] since its founding in 1693, making it America's second-oldest college (after [[Harvard University]]).
Technically a university, William & Mary was also the first U.S. institution to have a [[Royal Charter]], and the only one to have [[Coat-of-arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in London.
The campus adjoins the [[Colonial Williamsburg]], and the [[Wren Building]] at the head of Duke of Gloucester Street was one of the earliest restored by [[W.
Goodwin]] and the family of [[John D.
Williamsburg is primarily served by two newspapers, [[The Virginia Gazette]] and Williamsburg-Yorktown Daily.[53]
The Gazette is a biweekly, published in Williamsburg, and was the first newspaper to be published south of the [[Potomac River]], starting in 1736.[citation needed] Its publisher was [[William Parks (publisher)]], who had similar ventures in Maryland.[54][55] After his death in 1750, Parks's shop foreman William Hunter restarted the paper in 1751.[56]
The [[Daily Press (Virginia)]], published in nearby [[Newport News, Virginia]], covers local, regional, and national news.
The [[College of William & Mary]] has two student newspapers, the student-fee-supported campus newspaper [[The Flat Hat]] and the independent campus newspaper [[The Virginia Informer]].[57] William & Mary students [[List of publications at The College of William & Mary]] and run their own radio station, [[WCWM]].
Hampton Roads Magazine is a bimonthly regional magazine for Williamsburg and the Hampton Roads area.[58] Williamsburg is served by a variety of AM and FM radio stations, including two based directly within city limits; [[WTYD]] and [[WBQK]].
Williamsburg is served by the [[Norfolk, Virginia]]–[[Portsmouth, Virginia]]–[[Newport News, Virginia]] [[Designated market area]] (DMA), the nation's 42nd-largest, with 712,790 homes (0.64% of the total U.S.).[59]
Williamsburg is located adjacent to [[Interstate 64 in Virginia]] and [[U.S. Route 60 in Virginia]], which connect the city with [[Richmond, Virginia]] to the northwest and [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to the southeast.
[[State Route 199 (Virginia)]], officially named the Humelsine Parkway after a former Colonial Williamsburg president, surrounds the city in a semicircle.
[[State Route 5 (Virginia)]] links the city with the [[James River Plantations]] along the north shore of the [[James River (Virginia)]], [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)]] and Richmond.
[[State Route 31 (Virginia)]] provides a route to Jamestown and the toll-free [[Jamestown Ferry]].
The [[Colonial Parkway]] provides a bucolic low-speed link to Jamestown and Yorktown, passing under Colonial Williamsburg in a tunnel.
The community's public bus system, [[Williamsburg Area Transit Authority]] (WATA), has its central hub at the transportation center.
A network of disabled-accessible [[Transit bus]] routes serve the city, [[James City County, Virginia]], and most portions of [[York County, Virginia]] adjacent to the Williamsburg area, with hourly service seven days a week, and half-hourly service on select routes during peak weekday hours.
The system also provides [[Paratransit]] services and operates replica trolley buses at the [[Yorktown, Virginia]] attraction.[61] WATA connects with the much larger [[Hampton Roads Transit]] (HRT) bus system at [[Lee Hall, Virginia]] in northwestern Newport News and at the Williamsburg Transportation Center.[62]
Walking is a major mode of transportation in Williamsburg, with approximately one-fifth of people walking to work between 2006 and 2010.[63] [[Walk Score]], a website which algorithmically determines how friendly communities are to walkers, describes the city as "very walkable".[64] With few exceptions, motorized traffic is not allowed on Duke of Gloucester Street, which passes through Colonial Williamsburg and the shopping district of Merchant's Square.[65] The city is also increasingly bicycle-friendly, having built 48 miles of bicycle facilities in the area since 1992.[66] Upon completion, the [[Virginia Capital Trail]] will provide a paved off-road path to Richmond for bicyclists and pedestrians via the Colonial Parkway.
The primary airport for the Virginia Peninsula is the [[Williamsburg International Airport]] in Newport News, a twenty-minute drive from Williamsburg.[67] [[Norfolk International Airport]] and [[Richmond International Airport]] also serve passengers from the city.
[[Amtrak]] serves Williamsburg with three trains a day stopping at the [[Williamsburg (Amtrak station)]].
The line runs west along the [[Virginia Peninsula]] to [[Richmond, Virginia]] and points beyond.
A high-speed rail connection at Richmond to both the [[Northeast Corridor]] and the [[Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor]] are also under study.[68] Intercity bus services are provided by [[Greyhound Lines]].
