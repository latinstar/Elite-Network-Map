Angelo Robert Mozilo (December 16, 1938 – July 16, 2023) was an American mortgage industry banker who was co-founder, [[Chairman of the board]], and chief executive officer of mortgage giant [[Countrywide Financial]] until July 1, 2008.
Mozilo retired shortly after the sale to Bank of America for a total of $4.1 billion in stock.[1][2] The company's status as a major [[Lender]] of [[Subprime mortgage]] made it a central player in a [[Subprime mortgage crisis]] which collapsed the industry, bursting a [[2000s United States housing bubble]] which had accumulated throughout the 2000s, and contributing heavily to the [[Great Recession]].
Angelo Robert Mozilo was born in [[The Bronx]] on December 16, 1938.[3][4] His grandparents were Italian immigrants and his father was a butcher.[5][6] He attended Catholic schools as a child, and helped his father with his business from age 12.[7] When he was 14, he began working as a messenger for a mortgage broker.[4] He was a graduate of [[Fordham University]].[4]
In 1969, he and his former [[Mentorship]] [[David S.
Loeb]], who had already started a mortgage lending company, founded Countrywide Credit Industries in New York.[4] They later moved the headquarters to [[Pasadena, California]], and then to [[Calabasas, California]], in [[Los Angeles County]].[4] Mozilo and Loeb cofounded [[IndyMac Bank]], which was originally known as Countrywide Mortgage Investment, before being spun off as an independent bank in 1997.
After Countrywide was listed on the [[NYSE]] in 1984, Mozilo sold $406 million (~$1.03 billion in 2024) worth of its stock, mostly obtained through stock option grants.
When subprime loans came onto the scene in the late 1980s (Guardian S&L) and 1990s ([[The Money Store (company)]]), his company did not participate.
Perhaps more than any single individual, Mozilo has come to symbolize, and bear the blame for, the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]].
Cisneros]], former secretary of [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and member of the Countrywide board of directors, described Mozilo as "sick with stress—the final chapter of his life is the infamy that's been brought on him, or that he brought on himself." [[CNN]] named Mozilo as one of the 'Ten Most Wanted: Culprits' of the 2008 financial collapse in the United States,[11] a theory further supported in [[Inside Job (2010 film)]], an [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary on the [[2008 financial crisis]].
For years afterward, Mozilo denied that the subprime mortgage industry bore any responsibility for the crisis, instead attributing it to a [[Credit crunch]].[5]
Mozilo's compensation during the [[United States housing bubble]] of 2001–06 later came under scrutiny.
During that period, his total compensation (including salary, bonuses, options and restricted stock) approached $470 million.[12] His compensation also included payment for equity memberships and annual country club dues at [[Sherwood Country Club]] in [[Thousand Oaks, CA]], The Quarry at La Quinta golf club in [[La Quinta, California]], and at the [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Club]] in [[Gainesville, Virginia]].[13]
Mozilo testified before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] on March 7, 2008, calling reports of his pay "grossly exaggerated" in some instances and pointing out that he lost millions as well.
On June 4, 2009, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] charged him with [[Insider trading]] and [[Securities fraud]].[15][16]
[[Robert Khuzami]], director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said in a statement that "Mozilo's record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite." By settling the SEC charges, Mozilo avoided a trial that could have led to future criminal charges.[17][18]
In June 2008, [[Conde Nast Portfolio]] reported that several influential lawmakers and politicians, including [[Senate Banking Committee]] Chairman [[Christopher Dodd]], [[Senate Budget Committee]] Chairman [[Kent Conrad]], and former [[Fannie Mae]] CEO [[James A.
[[Democratic Party (United States)]] Senator Dodd received a $75,000 reduction in mortgage payments from Countrywide at allegedly below-market rates on his Washington, D.C., and Connecticut homes.[19][21] Dodd nonetheless called for stronger regulation of mortgage lenders and proposed that predatory lenders should face criminal charges.[19]
[[Alphonso Jackson]], acting secretary of HUD at the time and long-time friend and Texas neighbor of President Bush, received a discounted mortgage for himself and sought one for his daughter.
"In 2003, using V.I.P. loans for nearly $1 million apiece, [[Franklin Raines]], Fannie Mae’s chairman and C.E.O. from 1999 to 2004, twice refinanced his seven-bedroom home, which has a pool and movie theater."[19]
Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s son Paul Pelosi Jr. also received a loan with Countrywide.
[[Barbara Boxer]], [[Adam H.
Putnam]], [[Richard C.
Holbrooke]], [[James E.
Clyburn]], and [[Donna Shalala]] are among those with mortgages from Countrywide.
[[CBS News]] obtained a list of then-[[Fannie Mae]] employees whose names have been turned over to investigators as having received VIP loans from Countrywide.[22]
Mozilo was a resident of [[Montecito, California]], where he died on July 16, 2023, at age 84, of natural causes.[24][25]
In the documentary film [[Inside Job (2010 film)]], Mozilo is cited as one of the persons responsible for the economic meltdown of 2008[6] and named in [[Time (magazine)]] magazine as one of the "25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis".[26] [[Condé Nast Portfolio]] ranked Mozilo second-worst on their list of "Worst American CEOs of All Time".[a][27]
In the 2011 four-part investigative series Meltdown, [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] named Mozilo as one of the people responsible for the trend of making subprime loans to borrowers with poor credit history.[28]
