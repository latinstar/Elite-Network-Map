The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), commonly known as Fannie Mae, is a United States [[Government-sponsored enterprise]] (GSE) and, since 1968, a [[Publicly traded company]].
Founded in 1938 during the [[Great Depression]] as part of the [[New Deal]],[2] the corporation's purpose is to expand the [[Secondary mortgage market]] by [[Securitization]] [[Mortgage loans]] in the form of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS),[3] allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market by reducing the reliance on locally based [[Savings and loan association]] (or "thrifts").[4] Its brother organization is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), better known as [[Freddie Mac]].
In 2025, with over $4.3 trillion in assets, Fannie Mae is the largest company in the United States and the fifth largest company in the world, by assets.[5][6] Fannie Mae was ranked number 25 on the [[Fortune 500]] rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and was ranked number 50 on the [[Fortune Global 500]] rankings of the largest global corporations by total revenue.[5][6] In terms of profit, Fannie Mae is the 17th most profitable company in the United States and the 32nd most profitable in the world.[5][6]
Historically, most [[Mortgage]] in the early 1900s in the United States were short term mortgage loans with [[Balloon payment mortgage]].[7] [[Great Depression]] weakened the U.S. housing market, as people lost their jobs and were unable to make payments.
To address this, Fannie Mae was established by the U.S. Congress in 1938 by amendments to the [[National Housing Act of 1934]][9] as part of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].
Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home loans in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing.[10] Fannie Mae created a liquid [[Secondary mortgage market]] and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) insured mortgages.[11] For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market.[10] Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: about a third of the nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.[12]
Fannie Mae was acquired by the [[Housing and Home Finance Agency]] from the Federal Loan Agency as a constituent unit in 1950.[13] In 1954, an amendment known as the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act[14] made Fannie Mae into "mixed-ownership corporation", meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock;[9] in 1968 it converted to a privately held corporation, to remove its activity and debt from the [[Federal budget (United States)]].[15] In the 1968 change, arising from the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]], Fannie Mae's predecessor (also called Fannie Mae) was split into the current Fannie Mae and the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] ("Ginnie Mae").
Ginnie Mae, which remained a government organization, guarantees FHA-insured mortgage loans as well as [[United States Veterans Administration]] (VA) and [[Farmers Home Administration]] (FmHA) insured mortgages.
In 1970, the federal government authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional loans, i.e. those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created the [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]] (FHLMC), colloquially known as Freddie Mac, to compete with Fannie Mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market.[16] That same year FNMA went public on New York and Pacific Exchanges.[17]
Bush]] signed the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1992]].[19] The Act amended the charter of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reflect the Democratic Congress' view that the [[Government-sponsored enterprise]] "have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return".[20] For the first time, the GSEs were required to meet "affordable housing goals" set annually by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) and approved by Congress.
In 1999, Fannie Mae came under pressure from the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA) of 1977.[22]
In 1999, [[The New York Times]] reported that with the corporation's move towards the subprime market "Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times.
In 2000, because of a re-assessment of the housing market by [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], anti-predatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky, high-cost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals.
As [[Daniel Mudd]], then president and CEO of Fannie Mae, testified in 2007, instead the agency's underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences:
Borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered [[Teaser rate]], interest-only, [[Negative amortization]] and payment options and low-documentation requirements on top of floating-rate loans.
[[Alex Berenson]] of [[The New York Times]] reported in 2003 that Fannie Mae's risk was much larger than was commonly believed.[27] [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] wrote in [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)]]: "The government-sponsored institution Fannie Mae, when I look at its risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite, vulnerable to the slightest hiccup.
On January 26, 2005, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (S.190) was first introduced by U.S. Senator [[Chuck Hagel]].[29] The Senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing GSE regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the GSEs. After being reported favorably by the Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in July 2005, the bill was never considered by the full Senate for a vote.[29] Sen.
Following their mission to meet federal [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) housing goals, GSEs such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families and underserved areas generally through special affordable methods such as "the ability to obtain a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a low down payment ...
and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions".[34] Then in 2003–2004, the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]] began.[35] The market shifted away from regulated GSEs and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization (PLS) conduits, typically operated by investment banks.
This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the [[2008 financial crisis]].
Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through [[Credit default swap]], making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.
The shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution occurred as [[Financial institution]] sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates.
Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, [[Fixed-rate mortgage]] (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in [[Mortgage underwriting]] standards.[35] The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders.
The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance[35] that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgage loans [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]], caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures.
The [[US Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock.
On July 11, 2008, [[The New York Times]] reported that U.S. government officials were considering a plan for the U.S. government to take over Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis.[36] Fannie Mae and smaller Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump.[citation needed][37] The government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of $5 trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies.[37]
[[U.S. Treasury]] Secretary [[Henry M.
As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]] (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market (equivalent to $17,110,000,000,000 in 2024).[36] If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive.
Fannie and Freddie [[Bond (finance)]] were owned by everyone from the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]], to [[Money market fund]], to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people.
Paulson's plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two GSEs, rather than provide loans as he did for [[AIG]] and the major banks; he told president Bush that "the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor", in a reference to the [[French Revolution]].[41] The major banks have since been sued by the Feds for a sum of $200,000,000, and some of the major banks have already settled.[42] In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for a) creating an environment by which Fannie and Freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b) forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by (a), and c) the gross violation of the ([[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]) taking clause.
On September 7, 2008, James Lockhart, director of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA), announced that Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] were being placed into [[Conservatorship]] of the FHFA.
Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the [[Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board]].[53]
On May 11, 2015 [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that A U.S. District Court judge said [[Nomura Holdings Inc.]] was not truthful in describing mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]], giving a victory to the companies' conservator, the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA).
[[Denise Cote]] asked the FHFA to propose updated damages to be paid by Nomura and co-defendant [[RBS Securities]], which underwrote some of the investments.
The [[Settlement (law)]] have brought Fannie and Freddie $18 billion in penalties.
In her decision, Judge Cote wrote that Nomura, in offering documents for [[Mortgage-backed security]] sold to Fannie and Freddie, didn't accurately describe the loans' quality.
Nomura and RBS were two of 18 financial institutions, including [[Bank of America Corp.]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.]], targeted in 2011 by the FHFA, which alleged that the companies lied about the quality of the loans underlying the securities.
In October 2025, top Fannie Mae executives were fired after internally questioning the release by marketing head Lauren Smith – an associate of [[Bill Pulte]], the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump]] FHFA director – of confidential mortgage pricing data to Freddie Mac, a principal competitor.
Per the [[Associated Press]], "[w]hile Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late [October], along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies."[61]
Fannie Mae's charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing loans with a loan-to-values over 80% without [[Mortgage insurance]] or a repurchase agreement with the lender;[9] however, in 2006 and 2007 Fannie Mae did purchase [[Subprime lending]] and [[Alt-A]] loans as investments.[63]
Fannie Mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them; it then sells the resultant mortgage-backed security to investors in the [[Secondary mortgage market]], along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investor.[citation needed].
In addition, Fannie MBS, like those of Freddie Mac MBS and Ginnie Mae MBS, are eligible to be traded in the "to-be-announced" or "TBA" market.[64] By purchasing the mortgages, Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans.
Fannie Mae produced an automated underwriting system (AUS) tool called Desktop Underwriter (DU) which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming; Fannie Mae followed this program up in 2004 with Custom DU, which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well.[66] The [[Secondary market]] for nonconforming loans includes [[Jumbo loans]], which are loans larger than the maximum that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase.
In early 2008, the decision was made to allow TBA (To-be-announced)-eligible [[Mortgage-backed security]] to include up to 10% "jumbo" loans.[67]
The conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, is set by Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulator of both GSEs. OFHEO annually sets the limit of the size of a [[Conforming loan]] based on the October to October changes in mean home price, above which a mortgage is considered a non-conforming [[Jumbo loan]].
The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in [[Alaska]] and Hawaii.
For example, the implied guarantee allowed Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] to save billions in borrowing costs, as their credit rating was very good.
The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]].
Lastly, [[Money market fund]] have diversification requirements, so that not more than 5% of assets may be from the same issuer.
In 1996, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] wrote "there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies.
FNMA is a financial corporation which uses [[Derivative (finance)]] to "hedge" its cash flow.
Derivative products it uses include [[Interest rate swap]] and options to enter interest rate swaps ("pay-fixed swaps", "receive-fixed swaps", "[[Basis swap]]", "[[Interest rate cap]] and [[Swaption]]", "[[Forward starting swaps]]").
"The company said that in April its average [[Duration gap]] widened to plus 3 months in April from zero in March." "The Washington-based company aims to keep its duration gap between minus 6 months to plus 6 months.
The [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] released a report[76] on September 20, 2004, alleging widespread accounting errors.
On December 18, 2006, U.S. regulators filed 101 civil charges against [[CEO]] [[Franklin Raines]]; chief financial officer J.
Timothy Howard; and the former [[Controller (accounting)]] Leanne G.
In June 2008, [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that two former CEOs of Fannie Mae, [[James A.
Johnson (businessman)]] and [[Franklin Raines]], had received loans below market rate from [[Countrywide Financial]].
Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] have given contributions to lawmakers currently sitting on committees that primarily regulate their industry: The House Financial Services Committee; the Senate Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee; or the Senate Finance Committee.[citation needed] The others have seats on the powerful Appropriations or Ways & Means committees, are members of the congressional leadership or have run for president.
In December 2011, six Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] executives, including [[Daniel Mudd]], were charged by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] with securities fraud.[82] "The SEC alleges they 'knew and approved of' misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal exposure to subprime loans at the height of home mortgage bubble."[83] Former Freddie chief financial officer Anthony "Buddy" Piszel, who in February 2011, was CFO of [[CoreLogic]], "had received a notice from the SEC that the agency was considering taking action against him".
Piszel was not among the executives charged in December 2011.[84] Piszel had been succeeded at Freddie by [[David Kellermann]].
Kellermann [[David Kellermann#Death]] during his tenure at Freddie.
[[JPMorgan Chase]] was one of 18 financial institutions the [[FHFA]] sued back in 2011, accusing them of selling to Fannie and Freddie securities that "had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials".
Fannie and Freddie, the government-backed housing finance firms, sustained massive losses on [[Mortgage-backed security]] as the housing market imploded, requiring a [[Bailout]] of over $187 billion.
Swiss lender [[UBS]] has already reached an $885 million settlement with the FHFA in connection with losses Fannie and Freddie sustained on over $6.4 billion worth of mortgage securities.
The agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with [[Citigroup]] and [[General Electric]].
The FHFA is reportedly seeking $4 billion from JPMorgan to resolve its claims over $33 billion worth of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie by JPMorgan, [[Bear Stearns]] and [[WaMu]].
[[Bank of America]], which acquired [[Countrywide Financial]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] during the [[2008 financial crisis]], could be liable for even more.
On May 29, 2013, the [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that a former [[Foreclosure]] specialist at Fannie Mae has been charged but pleaded "not guilty" to accepting a [[Kickback (bribery)]] from an Arizona [[Real estate broker]] in a [[Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse (Santa Ana)]].
Another lawsuit filed earlier in [[Orange County, California]] [[Superior Courts of California]], this one for [[Wrongful termination]], has been filed against Fannie Mae by an employee who claims she was fired when she tried to alert management to kickbacks.
On May 8, 2013, Representative [[Scott Garrett]] introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]] into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].
The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]].[92] The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].[92] The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.[93] These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be.
