Dilma Vana Rousseff (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈdʒiwmɐ ˈvɐ̃nɐ ʁuˈsɛf(i)]; born 14 December 1947) is a Brazilian economist and politician who served as the 36th [[President of Brazil]] from 2011 until [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and removal from office on 31 August 2016.[1] She is the [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government]] to have held the Brazilian presidency.[2] Since March 2023, she has been the Chair of the [[New Development Bank]].
She also served in the cabinet of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during his first presidency—first as [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)]], from 2003 to 2005, then as [[Chief of Staff of the Presidency]] from 2005 to 2010.[3]
Rousseff was raised in an [[Upper middle class]] household in [[Belo Horizonte]].[3] She became a [[Socialist]] in her youth.
After the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]] she joined left-wing and [[Marxist]] [[Urban guerrilla warfare]] groups that fought against the [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)]].
After her release, Rousseff rebuilt her life in [[Porto Alegre]] with her husband Carlos Araújo.[3] They both helped to found the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] (PDT) in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and participated in several of the party's electoral campaigns.
She became the treasury secretary of Porto Alegre under [[Alceu Collares]], and later Secretary of Energy of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] under both Collares and [[Olívio Dutra]].[3] In 2001, after an internal dispute in the Dutra cabinet, she left the PDT and joined the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT).[3]
In 2002, Rousseff became an energy policy advisor to presidential candidate [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], who on winning the election invited her to become his [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)]].[3] After chief of Staff [[José Dirceu]] resigned in 2005 in a political crisis triggered by the [[Mensalão scandal]], Rousseff became chief of staff and remained in that post until 31 March 2010, when she stepped down to run for president.[3] She was elected in a run-off in 2010, beating [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) candidate [[José Serra]].
In [[2014 Brazilian general election]] she won a narrow second-round victory over [[Aécio Neves]], also of PSDB, to serve her second term as president.[5]
Impeachment proceedings against Rousseff began in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] on 3 December 2015.
On 12 May 2016, the [[Senate of Brazil]] suspended President Rousseff's powers and duties for up to six months or until the Senate decided whether to remove her from office or to acquit her.[6] [[Vice President of Brazil]] [[Michel Temer]] assumed her powers and duties as acting president of Brazil during her suspension.[7][8] On 31 August 2016, the Senate voted 61–20 to convict, finding Rousseff guilty of breaking budgetary laws, and removed her from office.[9][10]
On 5 August 2018, the PT officially launched Rousseff's candidacy for a seat in the [[Brazilian Senate]] from the state of Minas Gerais.[11] Rousseff finished fourth in the final vote and was defeated for her Senate run.[12]
Dilma Vana Rousseff was born in [[Belo Horizonte]],[13] [[Minas Gerais]], southeastern Brazil, on 14 December 1947, to [[Bulgarian Brazilians]] lawyer and entrepreneur Pedro Rousseff (born Petar Rusеv, [[Bulgarian language]]: Петър Русев, 1900–1962)[14][15] and schoolteacher Dilma Jane da Silva (26 June 1924 – 13 July 2019).[16][17][18] Her father was born in [[Gabrovo]], in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]],[19][20] and was a friend of the Nobel Prize-nominated Bulgarian poet [[Elisaveta Bagryana]].[21] As an active member of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]],[22] banned in 1924, Petar Rusev fled Bulgaria in 1929 to escape political persecution; he settled in France.
He arrived in Brazil in the 1930s, already widowed (he left behind his son Lyuben-Kamen, who died in 2007), but soon moved to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.
He returned to Brazil several years later, settling in [[São Paulo]], where he succeeded in business.
Petar Rusev adapted his first name to [[Portuguese language]] (Pedro) and the last to French (Rousseff).
During a trip to [[Uberaba]], he met Dilma Jane da Silva, a young schoolteacher born in [[Nova Friburgo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]], and raised in Minas Gerais, where her parents were ranchers.
Pedro Rousseff was a contractor for [[Mannesmann]] steel in addition to building and selling real estate.
Rousseff was enrolled in [[Preschool]] at the Colégio Izabela Hendrix and primary school at Colégio Nossa Senhora de Sion, a girls' [[Boarding school]] run by nuns, who primarily taught in French.
In 1964, Rousseff left the conservative Colégio Sion and joined the Central State High School, a [[Mixed-sex education]] public school where the students often protested against the dictatorship that had been established after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]].
In 1967 she joined Worker's Politics ([[Portuguese language]]: Política Operária—POLOP), an organization founded in 1961 as a spinoff of the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]].
Its members found themselves divided over methods; some wanted to advocate for the election of a [[Constituent assembly]], but others advocated an armed struggle.[24] Rousseff joined the second group, which became the [[Comando de Libertação Nacional]] ([[Portuguese language]]: Comando de Libertação Nacional—COLINA).
According to Apolo Heringer Lisboa [pt], leader of Colina in 1968 who taught [[Marxism]] to Rousseff in high school, she chose armed struggle after reading Revolution inside the Revolution by [[Régis Debray]], a French intellectual who had moved to [[Cuba]] and become a friend of [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]].
Galeno, who had joined POLOP in 1962, had served in the [[Brazilian Army]], participating in [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état#The Sailors' Revolt]], for which he had been arrested in [[Ilha das Cobras]].
They married in 1968 in a [[Civil marriage]], after dating for one year.[22]
Rousseff participated in [[Comando de Libertação Nacional]] and advocated [[Marxist]] politics among labour union members and as editor of the newspaper The Piquet.
According to the magazine [[Piauí (magazine)]], she handled weapons.[22] Gilberto Vasconcelos, a former fellow militant, has stated that she "has never … practiced an act of violence".[25]
In early 1969 the [[Minas Gerais]] branch of Colina had only a dozen [[Militant]], little money, and few weapons.
In addition, Galeno had to undergo facial plastic surgery or a similar procedure (although he denies this) after a sketch of him was released for participating in a bank robbery.[citation needed] The organization ordered them to move to [[Rio de Janeiro]] since it was unsafe to remain.
Rousseff was 21 and had just finished her fourth [[Academic term]] at the [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]] School of Economics.[22]
There were many people from Minas Gerais in the Rio de Janeiro cell of Colina (including now-former Belo Horizonte mayor [[Fernando da Mata Pimentel]], then 18 years old), but the organization had no shelter for them.
They moved to a small hotel, then to an apartment, until Galeno was sent by the organization to [[Porto Alegre]].
Rousseff remained in Rio and helped the organization, attending meetings and transported weapons and money, according to [[Piauí (magazine)]].
She met [[Rio Grande do Sul]]-born lawyer Carlos Franklin Paixão de Araújo, then 31 years old, at a meeting; the two developed an attraction to one another.
Araújo headed a dissident group of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] ([[Portuguese language]]: Partido Comunista Brasileiro—PCB) and sheltered Galeno in Porto Alegre.
He had traveled through Latin America, met Castro and [[Che Guevara]], and been imprisoned for several months in 1964.
He joined the armed struggle after the issue of [[AI-5]] by the dictatorship in 1968.
In early 1969, he began to discuss the merger of his group with Colina and Popular Revolutionary Vanguard ([[Portuguese language]]: Vanguarda Popular Revolucionária—VPR), led by [[Carlos Lamarca]].
Rousseff attended meetings about the merger, formalized in two conferences in [[Mongaguá]], thus leading to the creation of [[Vanguarda Armada Revolucionária Palmares]]  ([[Portuguese language]]: Vanguarda Armada Revolucionária Palmares—VAR Palmares).
— Dilma Rousseff,
in a 2005 interview with [[Folha de S.Paulo]][4]
Carlos Araújo was chosen as one of the six leaders of VAR Palmares, a "political-military organization of [[Marxist-Leninist]] partisan orientation which aims to fulfill the tasks of the revolutionary war and the establishment of the working class party, in order to seize power and build socialism."[26]
According to Maurício Lopes Lima, a former member of Operação Bandeirantes [pt] (OBAN) – a para-legal structure which included the intelligence and torture services of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]—Rousseff was the primary leader of VAR Palmares, and he received reports calling her "one of the brains" of the revolution.
Police commissioner Newton Fernandes, who investigated the clandestine organization in [[São Paulo]] and profiled dozens of their members, said that Rousseff was one of the principal masterminds.
The attorney who prosecuted the organization called her "[[Joan of Arc]] of subversion", saying that she led strikes and advised[clarification needed] bank robberies.[27] She was also dubbed "the she-pope of subversion", a "political criminal" and a "female figure of sadly notable aspect".[22] Rousseff ridicules such comparison, stating that she does not even remember many of the actions attributed to her.[28] According to her former comrade and current colleague, Environment Minister [[Carlos Minc]], her role in the group was sensationalized.
Rousseff has sometimes been described as the mastermind of the theft of a [[Safe]] belonging to former governor of [[São Paulo (state)]], [[Ademar de Barros]].
The action was carried out on 18 June 1969, in Rio de Janeiro, and netted 2.5 million U.S. dollars.[30] It became the most spectacular and profitable action of the armed struggle.[22] [[Carlos Minc]] has denied the participation of Rousseff in the event, saying that the widespread version that she was the leader of the organization is rather exaggerated, since she was merely a member of no distinction.
On at least three different occasions Rousseff herself also denied participating in the event.[29][31] Testimonials and police reports indicated that Rousseff was responsible for managing the money from the robbery, paying the salaries of the militants, finding a shelter for the group, and buying a [[Volkswagen Beetle]].
In 1969, [[VAR Palmares]] allegedly planned the kidnapping of [[Antônio Delfim Netto]], a symbol of the "[[Brazilian Miracle]]" and the most powerful civilian in the federal government at the time.
At a conference held in [[Teresópolis]] between August and September 1969, there was a major dispute between those who supported the armed struggle and those who advocated working with the masses.
There was a dispute over the money and weapons.[22] After the split, Rousseff was sent to [[São Paulo]], where she was in charge of keeping her group's weapons safe.
"If it was not for the gun, it is possible that she could have escaped," says Ribeiro.[22] Rousseff was considered a big enough catch that a military prosecutor labeled her the "[[Joan of Arc]]" of the guerrilla movement.[4]
Rousseff was taken to the OBAN headquarters, the same place where [[Vladimir Herzog]] would be tortured and killed five years later.
She was allegedly tortured for 22 days by punching, ferule, and [[Electric shock]] devices.[39] As Maria Luisa Belloque, a cellmate, said "Dilma was shocked even with car wiring." Some ex-military officers have dismissed Rousseff's account, saying that she could not have survived that extent of torture.[40] Later, Rousseff denounced the torture she suffered in court proceedings, citing even the names of those who tortured her, such as Army Captain Benoni de Arruda Albernaz, mentioned by several other witnesses.[41] Although she revealed the locations of some militants during torture interrogation, Rousseff managed to preserve the identities of Carlos Araújo (who would be arrested several months later) and Maria Celeste Martins.[22] Rousseff's name was on a list found at Carlos Lamarca's home, on a list of the prisoners who would get priority in exchange for hostages, but she was never exchanged and served out her sentence.[42]
After Rousseff was captured, he had an affair with actress and fellow militant [[Bete Mendes]].
For a few months they were even in the same prison in São Paulo, where during [[Conjugal visit]] they reconciled, planning to resume married life after being released from jail.[22] Rousseff was convicted in the first instance to six years in prison.
In December 2006, the Special Commission for Reparation of the Human Rights Office for the State of Rio de Janeiro approved a request for indemnification by Rousseff and eighteen other prisoners in law enforcement agencies of the São Paulo state government in the 1970s.[44] In her request, a pivotal witness was Vânia Abrantes, who was in the same police car that transferred her from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro (Vânia was Araújo's girlfriend when he and Rousseff began to date).[22] Rousseff also requested compensation in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, since she was arrested in São Paulo but taken for interrogation in the cities of [[Juiz de Fora]] and Rio de Janeiro.
The total compensation figure paid to victims of political persecution may be up to 72,000 [[Brazilian real]].
On 5 April 2009, an alleged criminal record of Rousseff containing notes about various crimes allegedly committed by her was published on the front page of [[Folha de S.Paulo]] published.
The document would have been part of the file of the Department of Political and Social Order ([[Portuguese language]]: Departamento de Ordem Política e Social—DOPS), the military regime's political police.
Rousseff questioned the veracity of the file, claiming that it was a forged document, which led the newspaper to declare that it had not obtained the document from DOPS' file, but rather via e-mail and, thus, could not guarantee its veracity.[45][46][47][48] The record can be found on a [[Far-right politics]] website which supports the regime.[49]
She was ten kilograms (22 pounds) thinner and had acquired [[Thyroid disease]].[50] She spent some time recovering with family in [[Minas Gerais]], visited an aunt in [[São Paulo]], then moved to [[Porto Alegre]], where Carlos Araújo was finishing the last months of his sentence.
Punished for subversion in accordance with decree number 477, considered the [[AI-5]] of universities, Rousseff was expelled from the [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]] and barred from resuming her studies at that university in 1973.[51] She decided to attend a preparatory course in order to take the [[Vestibular exam]] in economics at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]].
After graduation, she got her first paid job after serving her prison sentence as an intern at the Foundation of Economics and Statistics ([[Portuguese language]]: Fundação de Economia e Estatística—FEE), an organization linked to the government of Rio Grande do Sul.[50]
Her political activism, this time within the law, resumed at the Institute of Social and Political Studies ([[Portuguese language]]: Instituto de Estudos Políticos e Sociais—IEPES) linked to the only legalized opposition party, the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (MDB).
Even though she was not affiliated with the party, Rousseff organized debates at the institute, which received lectures from scholars such as Francisco de Oliveira, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], and Francisco Weffort.
In 1978, Rousseff attended the [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas]], with the intention of receiving a master's degree in economics.
At that time, she began attending a discussion group formed by other VAR Palmares former members, such as [[Rui Falcão]], Antonio Roberto Espinosa, and eventually Carlos Araújo.
They would read the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]], and [[Louis Althusser]], discussing what would be the right moment to resume their political activity.
She was, however, twice enrolled in the graduate program in economics at the [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas]], without ever fulfilling the requirements for those degrees.[52][53]
In the early 1990s, she enrolled in a course in Greek theater taught by playwright Ivo Bender.[citation needed] [[Greek mythology]] then became an obsession for her, and, influenced by [[Penelope]], she decided to learn how to [[Embroider]].
Her favorite actress is [[Fernanda Montenegro]].
Her website claims she is an avid reader, citing [[Machado de Assis]], [[Guimarães Rosa]], [[Cecília Meireles]], and [[Adélia Prado]] as her favorite authors.[citation needed]
Paula is a [[Law of Brazil]] graduate and holds the office of Labor [[Prosecutor]] in Porto Alegre.[56]
Paula Rousseff married [[Business administration]] Rafael Covolo in Porto Alegre on 18 April 2008.[57]
On 9 September 2010, Paula Rousseff gave birth to Rousseff's first [[Grandchild]], a boy named Gabriel Rousseff Covolo, in the city of Porto Alegre, during the 2010 presidential campaign of her mother.
After the last debate with four other candidates, on 30 September 2010, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which was aired on national TV, Rousseff flew to Porto Alegre for the christening of Gabriel in the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady Mother of God, Porto Alegre]] on 1 October 2010.[58]
At a press conference on 25 April 2009, Rousseff revealed that she was undergoing treatment to remove an early-stage axillar [[Lymphoma]], a cancer in the [[Lymphatic system]], which was detected in her left armpit during a routine [[Mammography]].
It was diagnosed as a [[Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]], an intermediate-grade type, but her chances of being cured were up to 90%.
She had curative [[Chemotherapy]] treatment for four months.[59]
In mid-May 2009, she was hospitalized in the Hospital Sírio-Libanês in [[São Paulo]], with severe pains in her legs.
The diagnosis was a [[Myopathy]], a muscle inflammation resulting from the cancer treatment.[citation needed] In early September that same year, she revealed she had completed her [[Radiotherapy]] treatment, claiming to be cured, later confirmed by her doctors.[citation needed]
She said it was still "full of holes", which was why she "couldn't take [the wig] off there in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], Denmark".
Although Rousseff states that her political thinking has changed drastically – from [[Marxism]] to pragmatic capitalism – she remains proud of her [[Political radicalism]] roots.[4]
Rousseff's views are mostly [[Anti-abortion]], supporting it only for pregnancies which endanger the life of the mother or are the result of rape, cases in which the [[Abortion in Brazil]] allows women to terminate their pregnancies.[62][63] However, she was criticized by sectors of the [[Catholic Church in Brazil]] and other religious groups, due to her past support for the legalization of abortion.
This was also a main target of criticism by [[José Serra]]'s campaign as well as the newsmagazine [[Veja (magazine)]], which emphasized Rousseff's past and current positions on its cover.[64] The subject only faded away from the news after the information became public that José Serra's wife, Monica Serra, had reportedly had an abortion in her youth.[65][66]
When asked about the criminal prosecution against [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo]] goalkeeper [[Bruno Fernandes de Souza]], accused of killing his former girlfriend Eliza Samudio, Rousseff said that she opposes the death penalty.[67] According to her, "if it were effective, there would not be such crimes in the United States."[67]
Rousseff opposes [[Gay marriage]], but supports same-sex [[Civil union]].[68] She said, "Marriage is a religious issue.
We have to respect them."[68] On the subject of same-sex civil union, Rousseff said that "basic [[Civil rights]] should be recognized within the civil legal framework."[68] She also opposes the [[Drug liberalization]], stating that "Brazil today is in no condition to propose the decriminalization of any drug."[69]
As a member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]], a [[Social democracy]] party which opposes [[Third Way (centrism)]], Rousseff was expected to be against [[Privatization]] and [[Neoliberalism]].
[[The Nation]], as an example of this rationale, described Rousseff's victory as a defeat for the [[Washington Consensus]].[70] Rousseff, however, has had an ambiguous stance on issues that involve privatization.
She is, for instance, "in favor of granting to private enterprises the construction of new power plants and roads, should it be cheaper to do them through grants than through [[Public works]]."[71] Additionally, she favored the privatization of airports in order to prepare Brazil's infra-structure for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].[72]
She also pledged to deepen the [[Social welfare]] network inaugurated by the Lula administration, saying that, under her rule, "Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility."[71]
In 2014, during the presidential elections, the president, Dilma Rousseff, supported the criminalization of [[Homophobia]], citing the "high rate" of acts of violence against homosexuals in the country.[73]
When the mandatory two-party system ended in the early 1980s, Rousseff participated, along with Carlos Araújo, in [[Leonel Brizola]]'s efforts to restructure the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)]] (of [[Social-democratic]] President [[João Goulart]], overthrown by the 1964 coup).
After the [[Supreme Electoral Court (Brazil)]] gave the name registry to the group linked to Ivete Vargas ([[Getúlio Vargas]]' niece), Rousseff and the group linked to Brizola founded the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] ([[Portuguese language]]: Partido Democrático Trabalhista—PDT).[50] Araújo was elected state deputy three times for this party, in 1982, 1986, and 1990.
He was also the party's candidate for Porto Alegre mayor twice, losing to Workers' Party members [[Olívio Dutra]] in 1988, and [[Tarso Genro]] in 1992.
After elected, Collares appointed Rousseff as the municipal Secretary of Treasury; this was her first job in the [[Executive (government)]].
In the gubernatorial campaign of fellow [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] member Aldo Pinto in 1986, Rousseff had an advising role.
Pinto's running mate was Nelson Marchezan, one of the most prominent civilians during the [[Brazilian military government]].
They would be defeated by the [[PMDB]] candidate Pedro Simon.
Araújo's defeat jettisoned the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] of the local executive branch.
As Fraga later said, "I dismissed her because she had a problem with the [[Time clock]]."[50]
In 1995, after the end of Collares' term, Rousseff departed from her political office and returned to the FEE, where she was the editor of the magazine Economic Indicators ([[Portuguese language]]: Indicadores Econômicos).
I also appointed her because she was in a more left-leaning stance inside the PDT, less [[Populism]]."[50]
During the first year of the Dutra administration, the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] had gained some high-ranking offices, but Brizola felt that his party had very little space in the government, responsible for a tiny portion of the budget.
Unable to get more space inside the administration, [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] members of the government were pressured by the party leadership to step down.
Rousseff defended the maintenance of the alliance which had elected Dutra, supporting Genro's candidacy, and claiming she would not accept "[[Neoliberalism]] alliances with the right-wing".
In January 1999, Rousseff traveled to Brasília in order to alert the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] administration that if the authorities responsible for the power sector did not invest in generation and transmission of energy, the power cuts that Rio Grande do Sul faced early in her administration would take place in the rest of the country.[74] Therefore, the electricity crisis at the end of the [[Presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] affected millions of Brazilians, with the exception of those from the [[Southern Region, Brazil]], where no rationing was imposed, as there was no drought.
The issues related to the area of energy on the government plan of candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were discussed in meetings coordinated by physicist and nuclear engineer [[Luiz Pinguelli Rosa]].
Both of them were completely opposed to the [[Privatization]] of the sector, which was, in their opinion, responsible for the energy problems that the country was facing.
Then I was like: I think I found my Minister here."[50] Another factor which would have weighed heavily on Lula's choice was the sympathy that [[Antonio Palocci]] had for Rousseff, recognizing that she would have a much easier dialogue with the private sector than Pinguelli, in addition to her support of the Carta aos Brasileiros (Letter to the Brazilian People), agreeing with several market friendly changes in the Workers' Party.
Regarding the [[Free market]] of energy, Rousseff not only kept it as she expanded it as well.
José Luiz Alquéres, president of [[Light S.A.]], praised the approach taken by Rousseff, which is, according to him, helping the segment as a whole.
Convinced that urgent investments in power generation were required so that the country would not face a general blackout in 2009, Rousseff entered in a serious clash with then Minister of Environment, [[Marina Silva]], which defended the embargo on several construction sites, concerned with the ecological imbalance that they could cause.
A close friend of Lula, Pinguelli was appointed as president of [[Eletrobrás]], and found himself at odds with Rousseff on several occasions, considering an early resignation once.
Sauer, who took over the gas and energy department of [[Petrobras]], also clashed with the minister, who repulsed his ideas of a statist model.
For him, "Dilma is the most democratic person in the world, as long as you agree 100% with her."[50] He recently left PT and joined the [[Green Party (Brazil)]] along with Marina Silva.
She argued that it was a social inclusion goal that should be a part of [[Fome Zero]], (Zero Hunger) and that it was not possible to assume that such a program would provide a financial return.
The program was launched in November 2003, under the name [[Luz para Todos]] (Electricity for All), focused in regions with a low [[Human Development Index]] and toward families with total incomes equaling, up to, three times the minimum wage.
As Minister of Energy, Rousseff had the support of two key ministers of the Lula administration: [[Antonio Palocci]] and [[José Dirceu]].
After Dirceu resigned as Chief of the Presidential Staff due to his involvement in the so-called [[Mensalão scandal]], instead of being weakened, Rousseff was chosen by Lula to be the new chief of staff.
After Rousseff took office, the U.S. Consulate General in São Paulo sent a long profile of her to the [[United States Department of State]].
It detailed several aspects of her life, talking about her past activity in guerrilla organizations, her tastes and habits, and professional characteristics, being described as a prestigious and detailed technician, with the reputation of a [[Workaholic]] and a great ability to listen, but lacking political tact, turning directly to technicians rather than her superiors.[88][89]
On 13 June 2010, after more than two years of widespread speculation, Rousseff launched her [[Dilma Rousseff 2010 presidential campaign]] as the official presidential candidate for the Workers' Party in the [[2010 Brazilian presidential election]].[90] At that time, former [[São Paulo (state)]] Governor [[José Serra]], candidate for the center-right opposition bloc, had been at the top of the polls for over two years.
Rousseff's coalition, [[For Brazil to keep on changing]], was initially formed by nine political parties, which gave her the largest amount of time for advertisement on television.
This was the first time that PT got more television time than its main rival, the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB).
Rousseff's candidacy was also supported by notable international figures, such as Puerto Rican actor [[Benicio del Toro]],[95] First Secretary of the [[French Socialist Party]] [[Martine Aubry]],[96] and American filmmaker [[Oliver Stone]], who recorded a message on her behalf.[97] Singer [[Alcione Nazareth]],[98] [[Portuguese Brazilian]] economist [[Maria da Conceição Tavares]],[99] and journalist Hildegard Angel (daughter of [[Zuzu Angel]] and sister of [[Stuart Angel]])[100] also recorded messages on Rousseff's behalf.
On 15 October, [[Tom Morello]] posted a message on his Twitter account supporting her candidacy, which he said represented "the poor, the working class and the youth."[101]
On 18 October 2010, Brazilian artists and intellectuals held an event in the Oi Casagrande theatre in [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro, to show their support to Rousseff's candidacy.
Among them were [[Chico Buarque]], [[Beth Carvalho]], [[Alceu Valença]], [[Elba Ramalho]], Emir Sader, [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Leonardo Boff]], and [[Marilena Chaui]].[102] That same day, she received a letter of support by prominent members of the [[European Green Party]], such as [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Dominique Voynet]], [[Monica Frassoni]], [[Philippe Lamberts]], [[Noël Mamère]], [[José Bové]], and [[Yves Cochet]].[103] According to the letter, Serra represents "the worst in our society: gender bias, sexism and homophobia, along with the most shady and myopic economic interests."[103]
Brazilian newspaper [[Brasil de Fato]], as well as magazine [[CartaCapital]] both declared support for Rousseff's candidacy.[104][105] Rousseff won the presidency by an approximate margin of 56% to 44%, and took office on 1 January 2011, as the first woman president of the country.[106] She became the third female [[Head of government]] ever in the history of Brazil, and the first de jure female [[Head of state]] since the death of [[Maria I of Portugal]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs]] in 1816.
During her presidential campaign, Rousseff underwent a [[Makeover]], replacing glasses with contact lenses, undergoing [[Plastic surgery]] and adopting a different hairstyle.[107]
On 26 October 2014, Rousseff was re-elected [[President of Brazil]], after securing more than 51% of [[Vote]] in the closest election race since 1989.
An official count showed her rival, center-right candidate [[Aécio Neves]], taking just over 48% of the vote.[108]
According to Bulgarian media, Bulgaria experienced "Dilma fever."[109][110] The local media followed the presidential race in Brazil closely, interested in the election of a half-Bulgarian to rule over the world's 5th most populous nation and 7th largest economy.[110] In an interview for the [[24 Chasa]] newspaper, Rousseff said that she "feel[s] tenderness and love for [[Bulgaria]].
My father died when I was only fifteen years old and I did not have the chance to learn [[Bulgarian language]]."[111] In November 2010, an exhibition was held in Gabrovo about Rousseff's origins.[112]
After Rousseff's election, Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] promptly invited her for an official visit to the country.
The event –  which was organized by her transitional team, the Ministries of [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)]] and [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)]] and the [[President of Brazil]][118] – was awaited with some expectation, since she became the first woman ever to preside over the country.
Important female figures in Brazilian history were honored with panels spread across the [[Monumental Axis]].[119] According to the military police of the Federal District, around 30,000 people attended.[120]
Until 21 December 2010, the publishing house of the [[Senate of Brazil]] had printed 1,229 invitations for Rousseff's inauguration.[121] The National Congress expected a total of 2,000 guests for the ceremony.[121] As reported by the press, between 14 and 17 heads of state and government had confirmed their presence.[122][123] Among them were [[José Sócrates]],[124] [[Juan Manuel Santos]], [[Mauricio Funes]], [[Alan García]], [[José Mujica]], [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Álvaro Colom]], [[Alpha Condé]], [[Sebastián Piñera]], [[Evo Morales]][122] (later canceled due to last minute protests in his country), and [[Boyko Borisov]].[113] U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] sent Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to represent him.[122][125] Former Japanese Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] also attended.[122]
In addition to the formal ceremony, Rousseff's inauguration also featured concerts by five female Brazilian singers: [[Elba Ramalho]], [[Fernanda Takai]], [[Mart'nália]] and [[Zélia Duncan]], and Gaby Amarantos.[126] The [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)]] organized the cultural part of the event, having provided a budget of 1.5 million [[Brazilian real]] (around 800 thousand U.S. dollars) for it.[126] The concerts started at 10:00 am and stopped at 2:00 pm, with the start of the official inauguration ceremony.[127] The concerts continued from 6:00 to 9:00 pm.[127] Rousseff did not attend, as she held a reception at the Itamaraty Palace for foreign authorities attending her inauguration.[127] Each foreign authority had the opportunity to talk to her for 30 seconds.[127]
On 17 December 2010, Rousseff received from the Supreme Electoral Court a diploma attesting her victory in the 2010 presidential election, becoming the first woman in the history of Brazil to receive it.[128] She was unable to name all members of her [[Cabinet of Dilma Rousseff]] until that ceremony, as she had desired.[129] Rousseff completed the appointment of all 37 members of her cabinet on 22 December 2010.[130] Although she had projected that 30% of her cabinet would be composed of women,[131][132] the females appointed eventually made up 24% of her cabinet.
Rousseff's own [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] comprised 43% of her cabinet, with 16 members, while 12 other offices were handed out to six out of ten political parties that formed her winning [[Para o Brasil Seguir Mudando]].
The remaining 9 cabinet offices, among which were key offices such as the presidency of the [[Central Bank of Brazil]], the [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)]] and the Ministry of the Environment, were handed out to non-partisan technical names.[130]
Since she took office, Rousseff has changed the members of her cabinet members four times.[133] She has become the president which promoted the highest number of cabinet changes in the first six months of government.[133] On 7 June 2011, Rousseff's then chief of staff and influential PT leader, [[Antonio Palocci]] resigned from office due to a scandal involving his personal wealth evolution.[133] On the same day, [[Paraná (state)]] Senator [[Gleisi Hoffmann]] (also from PT) replaced him.[133] Three days later, Ideli Salvatti – former [[Santa Catarina (state)]] Senator for PT and Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture up until then – traded office with Luiz Sérgio – former mayor of [[Angra dos Reis]] and licensed federal deputy for [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]] (both for PT) and Secretary of Institutional Relations up until that moment.[133] On 6 July, [[Alfredo Nascimento (politician)]], then Minister of Transportation, left office after allegations that public works were being overbilled.[133] On 4 August, [[Nelson Jobim]] left the [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)]] after an interview he gave to the Piauí magazine criticizing both Hoffmann and Salvatti.[134] Rousseff named [[Celso Amorim]] to replace him.[134] Jobim had previously declared to have voted on [[José Serra]] for president.[134] With the changes, the female presence in the cabinet increased to 26%, while the PT presence increased to almost 45%.
Rousseff was also cited as the preferential candidate for 58% of the voters in the [[2014 Brazilian presidential election]], in which she was reelected.
Rousseff's popularity is attributed to popular measures of her government, such as the reduction of the federal tax in the energy bill and the exemption of federal tax in the products of the [[Consumer basket]] (meat, milk, beans, rice, flour, potatoes, tomatoes, bread, sugar, coffee powder, cooking oil, butter, bananas and apples).[137] The lowering of the [[Overnight rate]] conducted by the [[Central Bank of Brazil]] is also mentioned as a cause for Rousseff's high popularity.[138] This has caused some to consider her "populist", a consideration shared by her predecessor [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].[139][140]
In early 2015, Rousseff's popularity began to decline and in February 2015, a month before the [[2015 protests in Brazil]] began, Rousseff's approval rating dropped 19 points to 23% with 44% disapproving of her.[141]
In March and April 2015 millions of protesters took to the streets during the [[2015 protests in Brazil]] against Rousseff's alleged involvement in the [[Operation Car Wash]] which involved kickbacks and corruption.
When allegations surfaced that [[Graft (politics)]] occurred while President Rousseff was a member of the board of directors of [[Petrobras]], between 2003 and 2010, Brazilians became very upset with the government and called for Rousseff's impeachment.[144] No direct evidence implicating Rousseff in the scheme has been made public, and she denies having any prior knowledge of it.[145]
Rousseff's administration pushed to complete a number of [[Hydroelectric dam]] projects in the [[Amazon River]] Basin, despite appeals from local residents of areas that would be affected, including indigenous tribes, and pressure from both domestic and international groups.
Opposition to the dam projects, especially the [[Belo Monte Dam]] project, was driven by environmental, economic and human rights concerns, for both the people to be displaced and the workers brought in from other parts of Brazil to build the dams.
[[Xingu peoples]] ([[Kayapo]]) Chief [[Raoni Metuktire]] and members of other tribes affected by hydroelectric dam projects proposed or already under construction;[146] Brazilian and international NGOs,[147] including [[Greenpeace]],[148] [[Amazon Watch]][149] and [[International Rivers]][150] and international celebrities including director [[James Cameron]], actress [[Sigourney Weaver]], and musician [[Sting (musician)]][151] all called for a halt to [[Amazon Basin]] hydroelectric projects.
In the spring of 2012, 17,000 workers at the [[Jirau Dam]] site went on strike for over three weeks, and later some began looting [[Company store]], setting fire to dam structures, and destroying worker housing.
Meanwhile, multiple courts, offices and state governments continue to litigate to halt dam projects; the status of the Belo Monte project was reversed so many times via injunctions and appeals that only the Brazilian [[Supreme Federal Court]] remained[153] – along with, theoretically, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (CIDH), the judicial body of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), which also called on Brazil to halt Belo Monte and other projects accused of human rights violations.
Rousseff was less popular with Brazilian [[LGBT social movements]] than expected from a left-wing president, and an often cited reason is that there are many instances in the government's balance of power where disagreements with the right-wing factions may have side effects.[155] For example, although Brazil is a [[Secular state]] and [[Separation of church and state]], religion is openly discussed and involved in politics.
The best example is the [[Evangelical Caucus (Brazil)]].
The Brazilian [[Supreme Federal Court]] ruled 10–0 in May 2011, with one abstention, to legalise same-sex civil unions[156] (see also [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil]]).
The same month, however, a spokesperson for President Dilma Rousseff announced that she had suspended distribution of [[Sex education]] videos through the ministries of health and education, saying that "anti-homophobia kits", as they are known, were "inappropriate for children" and did not offer an objective view of homosexuality.[157]
The strike left millions of students without classes for months.[158] According to [[O Globo]], a Rio de Janeiro newspaper, she believes private sector jobs should be prioritized by her government's policies.[159]
Rousseff was ranked fourth in [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women]],[161] and the second most powerful in 2013.[162] In 2015 she was the 7th, and in 2016 she was no longer in the list.[163]
In August 2011, Rousseff was included in the [[Forbes]] list of the most powerful women in the world, at the 3rd position, behind Merkel and U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]].[164][165] In October 2010, she was included in the [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People]], at the 16th position.[166][167] She was the third highest placed woman on the list, after Angela Merkel and [[Sonia Gandhi]], [[President of the Indian National Congress]].
On 20 September, she received a [[Woodrow Wilson Awards]] at the [[Pierre Hotel]] in New York City, a distinction which was also given to her predecessor in 2009.
On the following day, she became the first woman to open a session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].[168] Rousseff was featured on the cover of [[Newsweek]] magazine on 26 September 2011.
On 2 December 2015, [[Eduardo Cunha]], president of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]], accepted a petition for Rousseff's impeachment.[175] A special committee held hearings and recommended that the full Chamber authorize presenting the charges to the Senate.
Rousseff was notified and under the [[Constitution of Brazil]] automatically suspended from the presidency pending a final decision of the Senate.[6] [[Vice President of Brazil]] [[Michel Temer]] assumed her powers and duties as acting president of Brazil during the suspension.[7][8]
On 5 August 2018, the Workers' Party convention in Minas Gerais officialized Rousseff as a [[Brazilian Senate]] candidate, representing the state, in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]].[11] She placed fourth in the election.
Of the two seats in the Senate for Minas Gerais, [[Rodrigo Pacheco (politician)]] and [[Carlos Viana]] were the winners.[177]
Rousseff was an interviewee for the 2019 documentary [[The Edge of Democracy]].[178]
On 24 March 2023, Rousseff was elected as the president of the [[BRICS]]-led [[New Development Bank]].[179]
