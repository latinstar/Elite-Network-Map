Time (stylized in [[All caps]] as TIME) is an American [[News magazine]] based in [[New York City]].
It was published [[Weekly newspaper]] for nearly a century.
Starting in March 2020, it transitioned to every other week.[2][3] It was first published in New York City on March 3, 1923, and for many years it was run by its influential co-founder, [[Henry Luce]].
A European edition (Time Europe, formerly known as Time Atlantic) is published in [[London]] and also covers the Middle East, Africa, and, since 2003, Latin America.
An Asian edition (Time Asia) is based in Hong Kong.[4] The South Pacific edition, which covers Australia, [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific Islands]], is based in [[Sydney]].
Since 2018, Time has been owned by [[Salesforce]] founder [[Marc Benioff]], who acquired it from [[Meredith Corporation]].
Time has been based in New York City since its first issue published on March 3, 1923, by [[Briton Hadden]] (1898–1929) and [[Henry Luce]] (1898–1967).
It was the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[5] The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor, respectively, of the [[Yale Daily News]].
The first issue of Time featured [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]], the retired [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], on its cover; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the magazine's issue from February 28, 1938, in commemoration of its 15th anniversary.[7] The cover price was 15¢ (equivalent to $2.77 in 2024).
According to Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941 by Robert Elson, "[[Roy Edward Larsen]] ...
In his book [[The March of Time]], 1935–1951, Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was "originally circulation manager and then general manager of Time, later publisher of [[Life (magazine)]], for many years president of Time Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce".[citation needed]
Around the time, they were raising $100,000 from wealthy [[Yale University]] alumni, including Henry P.
Davison, partner of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]], publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan & Co. banker Dwight Morrow; Henry Luce and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922.
Larsen was a [[Harvard University]] graduate, and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates.
After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling [[RKO Pictures]] stock he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] theater chain in [[New England]].
Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over Time and [[Fortune (magazine)]].
Other shareholders were [[Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.]], and the New York Trust Company ([[Standard Oil]]).[citation needed]
According to [[The March of Time]], as early as 1924, Larsen had brought Time into the infant radio business by broadcasting a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled Pop Question which survived until 1925.
Larsen next arranged for the 30-minute radio program [[The March of Time]] to be broadcast over [[CBS]] beginning on March 6, 1931.
[[People (magazine)]] magazine was based on Time's "People" page.
On September 10, 1979, [[The New York Times]] wrote, "Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65."
In 1987, [[Jason McManus]] succeeded [[Henry Grunwald (editor)]] as editor-in-chief,[8] and oversaw the transition before [[Norman Pearlstine]] succeeded him in 1995.
and Warner Communications merged, Time became part of [[Time Warner]], along with [[Warner Bros.]]
In 2000, Time became part of [[WarnerMedia#AOL Time Warner (2001–2003)]], which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.

named Martha Nelson as the first female editor-in-chief of its magazine division.[13] In September 2013, [[Nancy Gibbs]] was named as the first female managing editor of Time magazine.[13]
In November 2017, [[Meredith Corporation]] announced its acquisition of Time, Inc., backed by [[Koch brothers]].[14]
In 2017, editor and journalist [[Catherine Mayer]], who also founded the [[Women's Equality Party]] in the UK, sued Time through attorney [[Ann Olivarius]] for sex and age discrimination.[15][16] The suit was resolved in 2018.[17]
In March 2018, only six weeks after the closure of the sale, Meredith announced that it would explore the sale of Time and sister magazines [[Fortune (magazine)]], [[Money (magazine)]] and [[Sports Illustrated]], since they did not align with the company's lifestyle brands.[18]
In October 2018, Meredith Corporation sold Time to [[Marc Benioff]] and his wife Lynne for $190 million.
Benioff is the chairman and co-CEO of [[Salesforce.com]], Time is to remain separate from that company, with Benioff not involved in the magazine's daily operations.[19][20]
[[Forbes]] [[Chief operating officer]] [[Jessica Sibley]] was appointed CEO of Time in November 2022.[21]
In 2012 it had a circulation of 3.3 million, making it the 11th-most circulated magazine in the United States, and the second-most circulated weekly behind [[People (magazine)]].[25] In July 2017, its circulation was 3,028,013.[1] In October 2017, Time circulation dropped to two million.[26] In early 2023 Time had 1.3 million print subscribers and 250,000 digital subscribers.[22] Combined print and digital circulation was 1 million for the six months to 31 December 2024, down 7.1% year-on-year.[27]
Time initially possessed a distinctively "acerbic, irreverent style", largely created by Haddon and sometimes called "Timestyle".[28] Timestyle made regular use of [[Inverted sentence]], as famously parodied in 1936 by [[Wolcott Gibbs]] in [[The New Yorker]]: "Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind ...
Where it all will end, knows God!"[29] Time also coined or popularized many [[Neologism]] which became widespread, including  "socialite", "guesstimate", "televangelist", "pundit", and "tycoon",[28] and some less successful ones such as "cinemactress"[30] and "radiorator".[31] Time introduced the names "World War I" and "World War II"  in 1939, as opposed to older forms like "First World War" and "World War No. 2".[32] The [[False title]] construction was popularized by Time and indeed is sometimes called a "Time-style adjective".[33][34][35][36]

Until the mid-1970s, Time had a weekly "Listings" section with capsule summaries or reviews of current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers similar to [[The New Yorker]]'s "Current Events" section.[41]
The iconic red border was homaged or satirized by Seattle's [[The Stranger (newspaper)]] newspaper in 2010.[42] The border has only been changed eight times since 1927:
Former president [[Richard Nixon]] has been among the most frequently featured on the cover of Time, having appeared 55 times from August 25, 1952, to May 2, 1994.[47]
In 2007, Time redesigned the magazine to update and modernize the format.[50] Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased [[White space (visual arts)]] around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers.
In the past, such figures as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] have been Man of the Year.
In 2006, Person of the Year was "[[You (Time Person of the Year)]]", and was met with split reviews.
The magazine also compiled "[[Time's List of the 100 Best Novels]]" and "[[Time's All-Time 100 Movies]]" lists in 2005,[56][57][58] "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time" in 2007,[59] and "All-Time 100 Fashion Icons" in 2012.[60]
In February 2016, Time mistakenly included the male author [[Evelyn Waugh]] on its "100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes" list (he was 97th on the list).
The error created much media attention and concerns about the level of basic education among the magazine's staff.[61] Time later issued a retraction.[61]  In a [[BBC]] interview with [[Justin Webb]], Professor [[Valentine Cunningham]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], described the mistake as "a piece of profound ignorance on the part of Time magazine".[62]
The first Time magazine with an X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over [[Adolf Hitler]]'s face which was published the week following [[Death of Adolf Hitler]].
The second X cover was released more than three months later on August 20, 1945, with a black X (to date, the magazine's only such use of a black X) covering the [[Flag of Japan]], representing the recent [[Surrender of Japan]] and which signaled the end of [[World War II]].
Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, Time released another issue with a red X over [[Saddam Hussein]]'s face, two weeks after the start of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].
A third red X issue was that of June 19, 2006, after [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] was killed,[63][64] and a fourth red X cover issue was published on May 20, 2011, after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden]].[2][65]  A fifth red X cover issue, that of Dec.
14, 2020, had a red X scrawled over the pandemic-hit year [[2020]] and the declaration "the worst year ever".[3][4][66] As of 2024[update], the most recent and seventh X cover issue of Time, that of Nov.
11, 2024, features a red X over the face of [[Yahya Sinwar]] following [[Killing of Yahya Sinwar]] by the [[Israel Defense Forces]].[67]
The November 2, 2020, issue of the U.S. edition of the magazine, published the day before the [[2020 United States presidential election]], was the first time that the cover logo "TIME" was not used.
The cover of that issue used the word "VOTE" as a replacement logo, along with artwork by [[Shepard Fairey]] of a voter wearing a pandemic face mask.
The issue included information on how to vote safely during the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].
