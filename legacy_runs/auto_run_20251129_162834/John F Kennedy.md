John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), also known as JFK, was the 35th [[President of the United States]], serving from 1961 until [[Assassination of John F.
He was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age]] person [[United States presidential election]] president at 43 years.[a] Kennedy served at the height of the [[Cold War]], and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]].
A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)]], Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts]] in both houses of the [[United States Congress]] before his presidency.
Born into the prominent [[Kennedy family]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], Kennedy graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1940, joining the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] the following year.
During [[World War II]], he commanded [[PT boat]] in the [[Pacific War]].
Kennedy's survival following the sinking of [[PT-109]] and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]], but left him with serious injuries.
After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts's 11th congressional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1947 to 1953.
He was subsequently elected to the [[U.S. Senate]], serving as the junior [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts]] from 1953 to 1960.
While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book [[Profiles in Courage]], which won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]].
His campaign gained momentum after [[1960 United States presidential debates]] in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating [[Republican Party (United States)]] opponent [[Richard Nixon]], the incumbent vice president.
He increased the number of [[Military advisor#US advisors in Vietnam]] in [[South Vietnam]], and the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] began during his presidency.
In 1961, he authorized attempts to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]] in the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and [[Operation Mongoose]].
The resulting period of tensions, termed the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], nearly resulted in [[Nuclear war]].
In August 1961, after [[East Germany]] troops erected the [[Berlin Wall]], Kennedy sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and delivered [[Ich bin ein Berliner]] in West Berlin in June 1963.
In 1963, Kennedy signed the first [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].
He presided over the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]], [[Alliance for Progress]] with Latin America, and the continuation of the [[Apollo program]] with the goal of [[We choose to go to the Moon]] before 1970.
He supported the [[Civil rights movement]] but was only somewhat successful in passing his [[New Frontier]] domestic policies.
On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in [[Dallas]].
Johnson]], [[First inauguration of Lyndon B.
[[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by [[Jack Ruby]] two days later.
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Warren Commission]] both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but [[John F.
After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1964]].
Kennedy ranks highly in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] with historians and the general public.
His personal life has been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and [[Extramarital affair]].
Kennedy is the most recent [[List of presidents of the United States who died in office]].
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside [[Boston]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], on May 29, 1917,[2] to [[Joseph P.
Kennedy Sr.]], a businessman and politician, and [[Rose Kennedy]] ([[Née]] Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite.[3] His paternal grandfather, [[P.
Kennedy]], was an East Boston [[Political boss]] and [[Massachusetts Senate]].[4] Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, [[John F.
Fitzgerald]], was a U.S. congressman and two-term [[Mayor of Boston]].[5] All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.[1] Kennedy had an older brother, [[Joseph P.
Kennedy Jr.]], and seven younger siblings: [[Rosemary Kennedy]], [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish]], [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford]], [[Robert F.
Kennedy]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith]], and [[Ted Kennedy]].[6]
Kennedy's father amassed a private fortune and established [[Trust funds]] for his nine children, guaranteeing them lifelong financial independence.[7] His business kept him away from home for long stretches, but Joe Sr. was a formidable presence in his children's lives.
John's first exposure to politics came in [[1922 Massachusetts gubernatorial election]], when he toured [[Neighborhoods in Boston]] with his grandfather Fitzgerald during his unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign.[8][9] In September 1927, due to an outbreak of [[Polio]] in [[Massachusetts]] and Joe Sr.'s business interests in [[Wall Street]] and [[Cinema of the United States]], the family relocated from Boston to the [[Riverdale, Bronx]] neighborhood of New York City.[10][11] Several years later, his brother Robert told [[Look (American magazine)]] magazine that his father left Boston because of job signs that read: "[[No Irish Need Apply]]."[12] The Kennedys spent summers and early autumns at [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], a village on [[Cape Cod]],[13] where they engaged in various outdoor activities.[14] Christmas and Easter holidays were spent at their [[La Querida (mansion)]] in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].[15] In September 1930, Kennedy, 13 years old, was sent to the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], for 8th grade.
In April 1931, he had an [[Appendectomy]], after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[16]
In September 1931, Kennedy began attending [[Choate Rosemary Hall]], a preparatory boarding school in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]].[17] Rose had wanted John and Joe Jr. to attend a [[Catholic school]], but Joe Sr. believed that if they were to compete in the political world, they needed to be among boys from prominent [[Protestantism]] families.[18] John spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a clique.
In the next chapel assembly, the headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of "muckers" who would "spit in our sea," leading Kennedy to name his group "The Muckers Club." It included his roommate and lifelong friend [[Lem Billings]].[19][20] Kennedy graduated from Choate in June 1935, finishing 64th of 112 students.[11] He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the "most likely to succeed."[19]
Kennedy intended to study under [[Harold Laski]] at the [[London School of Economics]], as his older brother had done.
However, ill health forced his return to the United States in October 1935, when he enrolled late at [[Princeton University]], but had to withdraw after two months due to gastrointestinal illness.[21]
In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at [[Harvard College]].[22] He wrote occasionally for [[The Harvard Crimson]], the campus newspaper, but had little involvement with campus politics, preferring to concentrate on athletics and his social life.
Kennedy played [[American football]] and was on the junior varsity squad during his sophomore year, but an injury forced him off the team, and left him with back problems that plagued him for the rest of his life.
He earned membership in the [[Hasty Pudding Club]] and the [[Spee Club (Harvard)]], one of Harvard's elite "[[Harvard College social clubs#Origins]]".[23][24]
In July 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his older brother to work at the [[U.S. Embassy, London]], where their father was serving as President [[Franklin D.
Roosevelt]]'s ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]].[25] The following year, Kennedy traveled throughout Europe, the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Balkans]], and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis.[26] He then went to Berlin, where a U.S. diplomatic representative gave him a secret message about war breaking out soon to pass on to his father, and to [[Czechoslovakia]] before returning to London on September 1, 1939—the day that [[Invasion of Poland]]; the start of [[World War II]].[27] Two days later, the family was in the [[British House of Commons]] for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany.
Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to assist with arrangements for American survivors of the torpedoing of [[SS Athenia (1922)]] before flying back to the United States on his first transatlantic flight.[28][29]
While an upperclassman at Harvard, Kennedy began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in [[Political philosophy]].
He made the [[Dean's list]] in his junior year.[30] In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, "Appeasement in Munich", about British negotiations during the [[Munich Agreement]].
The thesis was released on July 24, under the title [[Why England Slept]].[31] The book was one of the first to offer information about the war and its origins, and quickly became a bestseller.[32] In addition to addressing Britain's unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to the war, the book called for an [[Anglo-American alliance]] against the rising totalitarian powers.
In 1940, Kennedy graduated [[Cum laude]] from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on [[International affairs]].[34] That fall, he enrolled at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and audited classes,[35] but he left after a semester to help his father complete his memoirs as an American ambassador.
Kennedy planned to attend [[Yale Law School]], but canceled those plans when American entry into World War II seemed imminent.[38] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the Army's [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)]].
On September 24, 1941, with the help of [[Alan Goodrich Kirk]]—the director of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI) and former naval [[Attaché]] to Joe Sr.—Kennedy joined the [[United States Naval Reserve]].
He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)]] on October 26, 1941,[39] and joined the ONI staff in Washington, D.C.[40][41][42]
In January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at Headquarters, [[Sixth Naval District]], in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].[41] He hoped to command a [[PT boat]], but his health problems seemed almost certain to prevent active duty.
Kennedy's father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the fleet.[43] Kennedy completed six months of training at the [[Naval Reserve Officer Training School]] in Chicago and at the [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center]] in [[Melville, Rhode Island]].[40][44] His first command was PT-101 from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943.[41] Unhappy with his assignment to the [[Panama Canal]], far from the fighting, Kennedy appealed to Senator [[David I.
Walsh]] of Massachusetts, who arranged for him to be reassigned to the [[Pacific Theater (World War II)]].[43]
In April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO,[40] and on April 24 he took command of [[Patrol torpedo boat PT-109]],[45] then based on [[Tulagi]] Island in the [[Solomon Islands]].[41] On the night of August 1–2, in support of the [[New Georgia campaign]], PT-109 and fourteen other PTs were ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's [[Kolombangara]] Island.
Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy.[46] On that moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was suddenly rammed at an angle and cut in half by the [[Japanese destroyer Amagiri (1930)]], killing two PT-109 crew members.[47][48][41][b] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam toward [[Plum Pudding Island]], 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2.[41][50] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman named Patrick McMahon [51] to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made forays through the coral islands, searching for help.[53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, Kennedy carved his location on a [[Coconut]] shell and requested a boat rescue.
The story was chronicled by John Hersey in [[The New Yorker]] in 1944; decades later, it was the basis of a successful [[PT 109 (film)]].[55] It followed Kennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader.[56] Hersey portrayed Kennedy as a modest, self-deprecating hero.[57] For his courage and leadership, Kennedy was awarded the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]], and the injuries he suffered during the incident qualified him for a [[Purple Heart]].[56]
After a month's recovery, Kennedy returned to duty, commanding [[PT-59]].
The 59 acted as a shield from shore fire as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River on [[Raid on Choiseul]], taking ten Marines aboard and delivering them to safety.[58] Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.[59] By December 1943, with his health deteriorating, Kennedy left the Pacific front and arrived in San Francisco in early January 1944.[60] After receiving treatment for his back injury at the [[Chelsea Naval Hospital]] in Massachusetts from May to December 1944, he was released from active duty.[61][40] Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three months recovering from his back injury at [[Castle Hot Springs (Arizona)]], a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.[62][63] On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.[64] When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: "It was easy.
In April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of [[William Randolph Hearst]], arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for [[Hearst Communications]]; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and "expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career".[71] He covered the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]], the [[1945 United Kingdom general election]], and the [[Potsdam Conference]] in Germany.[72]
Kennedy's elder brother, Joe Jr., had been the [[Kennedy family]] and was tapped by their father to seek the presidency.
Tobin]] discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in [[1946 Massachusetts gubernatorial election]] as a candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]], but Joe Sr. preferred a congressional campaign that could send John to Washington, where he could have national visibility.[74]
At the urging of Joe Sr., U.S. Representative [[James Michael Curley]] vacated his seat in the solidly Democratic [[11th congressional district of Massachusetts]] to become mayor of Boston in 1946.
Kennedy established legal residency at 122 Bowdoin Street across from the [[Massachusetts State House]].[75] He won the Democratic primary with 42 percent of the vote, defeating nine other candidates.[76] According to Fredrik Logevall, Joe Sr.
The campaign had a virtual monopoly on [[MBTA subway]] space, and on window stickers ("Kennedy for Congress") for cars and homes, and was the force behind the mass mailing of Hersey's PT-109 article.[77]
Though Republicans took control of the House in the [[1946 United States House of Representatives elections]], Kennedy defeated his Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote.[78]
As a congressman, Kennedy had a reputation for taking little interest in the management of his office or his constituents' concerns, with one of the highest absenteeism rates in the House, although much was explained by illness.[79] [[George Smathers]], one of his few political friends at the time, claimed that he was more interested in being a writer than a politician, and at that time, he suffered from extreme shyness.[79] Kennedy found "most of his fellow congressmen boring, preoccupied as they all seemed to be with their narrow political concerns".
Kennedy served in the House for six years, joining the influential [[Education and Labor Committee]] and the [[Veterans' Affairs Committee]].[81] He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the [[Truman Doctrine]] as an appropriate response to the emerging [[Cold War]].[82] He also supported [[Public housing]] and opposed the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], which restricted the power of labor unions.[83] Though not as vocally anti-communist as [[Joseph McCarthy]], Kennedy supported the [[Internal Security Act of 1950]], which required communists to register with the government, and he deplored the "[[Loss of China]]".[84][85] Kennedy denounced Truman and the State Department during a speech in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] on January 30, 1949, for contributing to the "tragic story of China whose freedom we once fought to preserve.
What our young men had saved [in World War II], our diplomats and our President have frittered away."[86][87] Having served as a [[Scouts BSA]] during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the [[Scouting in Massachusetts]] from 1946 to 1955 as district vice chairman, member of the executive board, vice-president, and National Council Representative.[88][89]
To appeal to the large [[Italian-American]] voting bloc in Massachusetts, Kennedy delivered a speech in November 1947 supporting a $227 million aid package to Italy.
He maintained that Italy was in danger from an "onslaught of the communist minority" and that the country was the "initial battleground in the communist drive to capture Western Europe."[90] To counter Soviet efforts to take control in Middle Eastern and Asian countries like [[French Indochina]], Kennedy wanted the United States to develop nonmilitary techniques of resistance that would not create suspicions of [[Neoimperialism]] or add to the country's financial burden.
Almost every weekend that Congress was in session, Kennedy would fly back to Massachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful in a future statewide campaign.[92] Contemplating whether to run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] or the [[U.S. Senate]], Kennedy abandoned interest in the former, believing that the governor "sat in an office, handing out sewer contracts".[93]
As early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in [[1952 United States Senate election in Massachusetts]] against Republican three-term incumbent [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] with the campaign slogan "KENNEDY WILL DO MORE FOR MASSACHUSETTS".[94] Joe Sr. again financed his son's candidacy—persuading the [[The Boston Post]] to switch its support to Kennedy by promising the publisher a $500,000 loan[95]—while John's younger brother [[Robert F.
Kennedy]] emerged as campaign manager.[96] Kennedy's mother and sisters were also highly effective canvassers, hosting a series of "[[Tea parties]]" at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women voters.[97][98] In the presidential election, Republican [[Dwight D.
Eisenhower]] carried Massachusetts by 208,000 votes, but Kennedy narrowly defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat.[99] The following year, he married [[Jacqueline Bouvier]].[100]
Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic [[Last rites]].
During his convalescence in 1956, he published [[Profiles in Courage]], a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography]] in 1957.[101] Rumors that this work was [[Ghostwriter]] by his close adviser and [[Speechwriter]], [[Ted Sorensen]], were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.[102]
Although Kennedy's and Lodge's legislative records were similarly liberal, Lodge voted for the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]] and Kennedy voted against it.
On [[NBC]]'s [[Meet the Press]], Kennedy excoriated Lodge for not doing enough to prevent the increasing migration of manufacturing jobs from Massachusetts to the South, and blamed the [[Right-to-work law]] provision for giving the South an unfair advantage over Massachusetts in labor costs.[103] In May 1953, Kennedy introduced "The Economic Problems of New England",[104] a 36-point program[105] to help Massachusetts industries such as [[Fishing industry]], [[Textile manufacturing]], [[Watchmaking]], and [[Shipbuilding]], as well as the Boston seaport.[106] Kennedy's policy agenda included [[Protective tariffs]], preventing excessive [[Speculation]] in raw [[Wool]], stronger efforts to research and market [[Fisheries of the United States]], an increase in the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] budget (including funds for [[US FWS Albatross III]]), funds to rehabilitate the [[South Boston Army Base]], shipbuilding contracts at the [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], and the development of [[Hydroelectric power in the United States]] and [[Nuclear power in the United States]] in New England—such as the [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station]] in [[Rowe, Massachusetts]], which began construction in 1958.[107][108][109] Kennedy's suggestions for stimulating the region's economy appealed to both parties by offering benefits to business and labor, and promising to serve national defense.
Congress would eventually enact most of the program.[106] A [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]] supporter, Kennedy wanted to make sure that the shorelines of [[Cape Cod]] remained unsullied by industrialization.
On September 3, 1959, Kennedy co-sponsored the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]] bill with his Republican colleague Senator [[Leverett Saltonstall]].[110][111]
As a senator, Kennedy quickly won a reputation for responsiveness to requests from constituents (i.e., co-sponsoring legislation to provide federal loans to help rebuild communities damaged by the [[1953 Worcester tornado]]), except on certain occasions when the national interest was at stake.[112][113] In 1954, Kennedy voted in favor of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, despite opposition from Massachusetts politicians who argued that the project would hurt the [[Port of Boston]] economically.[114]
In 1954, when the Senate voted to condemn [[Joseph McCarthy]] for breaking Senate rules and abusing an Army general, Kennedy was the only Democrat not to cast a vote against him.[115] Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure.
However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized for back surgery in Boston.[116] Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the [[Modern liberalism in the United States]] community in the 1956 and 1960 elections.[117]
In 1956, Kennedy gained control of the [[Massachusetts Democratic Party]],[118] and delivered the state delegation to the party's presidential nominee, [[Adlai Stevenson II]], at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]] in August.[119] Stevenson let the convention [[1956 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection]].
Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] of Tennessee, but receiving national exposure.[120]
In 1957, Kennedy joined the Senate's [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]] (also known as the McClellan Committee) with his brother Robert, who was chief counsel, to investigate [[Racketeering]] in labor-management relations.[121] The hearings attracted extensive radio and television coverage where the Kennedy brothers engaged in dramatic arguments with controversial labor leaders, including [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the [[Teamsters Union]].
The following year, Kennedy introduced a bill to prevent the expenditure of [[Union dues]] for improper purposes or private gain; to forbid loans from union funds for illicit transactions; and to compel [[Audit]] of unions, which would ensure against false [[Financial report]].[122] It was the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 and dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the McClellan Committee, but did not incorporate tough Taft–Hartley amendments requested by President Eisenhower.
That same year, Kennedy joined the Senate's [[Foreign Relations Committee]].[125] There he supported [[Algerian War]] from France and sponsored an amendment to the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act]] that would provide aid to [[Satellite state#Soviet satellite states]].
Kennedy in 1959 introduced a controversial bill to eliminate from the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1958 a provision requiring loyalty oaths and affidavits from aid recipients.[126]
Kennedy cast a procedural vote against President Eisenhower's bill for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]], and this was considered by some to be an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill.[127] Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader [[Lyndon B.
Most historians and political scientists who have written about Kennedy refer to his U.S. Senate years as an interlude.[134] According to historian [[Robert Dallek]], Kennedy called being a senator "the most corrupting job in the world." He complained that they were all too quick to cut deals and please campaign contributors to ensure their political futures.
Kennedy, with the luxury of a rich father who could finance his campaigns, could remain independent of any special interest, except for those in his home state of Massachusetts that could align against his reelection.[135] According to author [[Robert Caro]], Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson viewed Kennedy as a "[[Playboy lifestyle]]", describing his performance in the Senate and the House as "pathetic" on another occasion, saying that he was "smart enough, but he doesn't like the grunt work".[136] Author John T.
In [[1958 United States Senate election in Massachusetts]], Kennedy was re-elected to the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J.
On January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the [[1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].[139] Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters.
Kennedy faced several potential challengers, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, [[Adlai Stevenson II]], and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]].[140]
His campaign strategy was to win several primaries to demonstrate his electability to the [[Party boss]], who controlled most of the delegates, and to prove to his detractors that a Catholic could win popular support.[141] Victories over Senator Humphrey in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries gave Kennedy momentum as he moved on to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.[140][142]
Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother Robert, who wanted him to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]],[145] and other liberal supporters when he [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 1960]] as his vice-presidential nominee.
He believed that the Texas senator could help him win support from the [[Southern United States]].[146][147] In accepting the presidential nomination, Kennedy gave his well-known "[[New Frontier]]" speech:
At the start of the fall general election campaign, the Republican nominee and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.[149] Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Catholicism, the [[Cuban Revolution]], and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had [[Missile gap]] those of the U.S. To address fears that his Catholic faith would impact his decision-making, he told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12: "I am not the Catholic candidate for president.
I do not speak for my Church on public matters—and the Church does not speak for me."[150] He promised to respect the [[Separation of church and state]], and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy.[151][152]
The Kennedy and Nixon campaigns agreed to a series of [[1960 United States presidential debates]].[153] An estimated 70 million Americans, about two-thirds of the electorate, watched the first debate on September 26.[154] Kennedy had met the day before with the producer to discuss the set design and camera placement.
By contrast, Kennedy appeared relaxed, tanned, and telegenic, looking into the camera while answering questions.[155][153] It is often claimed that television viewers overwhelmingly believed Kennedy, appearing to be the more attractive of the two, had won, while radio listeners (a smaller audience) thought Nixon had defeated him.[154][156][157] However, only one poll split TV and radio voters like this and the methodology was poor.[158] Pollster [[Elmo Roper]] concluded that the debates raised interest, boosted turnout, and gave Kennedy an estimated two million additional votes, largely due to the first debate.[159] The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role.[101]
In the national popular vote, [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote#1960 Alabama results ambiguity]], Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the [[Electoral College (United States)]], he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[160] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because he supported the [[Civil rights movement]]; they voted for Senator [[Harry F.
Byrd]] of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[160] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age]] ever elected to the presidency (though [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a year younger when he succeeded to the presidency after the [[Assassination of William McKinley]] in 1901).[161][162]
He was willing to make the increased number of rapid decisions required in such an environment.[166] Though the cabinet remained important, Kennedy generally relied more on his staffers within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]].[167] Despite concerns over [[Nepotism]], Kennedy's father insisted that Robert Kennedy become [[United States Attorney General]], and the younger Kennedy became the "assistant president" who advised on all major issues.[168]
Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the [[Cold War]].
Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of [[Containment]] to stop the spread of communism.[169] Fearful of the possibility of [[Nuclear war]], Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as [[Flexible response]].
This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged [[Massive retaliation]], and encouraged [[Mutual deterrence]].[170][171] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the [[Military-industrial complex]], Kennedy focused on rearmament.
From 1961 to 1964 the number of [[Nuclear weapons]] increased by 50 percent, as did the number of [[B-52]] bombers to deliver them.[172]
In January 1961, [[Premier of the Soviet Union]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] declared his support for [[Wars of national liberation]].
Between 1960 and 1963, [[List of sovereign states by date of formation]] gained independence as the process of [[Decolonization]] continued.
Kennedy set out to woo the leaders and people of the "[[Third World]]," expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors.[175] His administration established the [[Food for Peace]] program and the [[Peace Corps]] to provide aid to [[Developing countries]].
During the election campaign, Kennedy attacked the Eisenhower administration for losing ground on the African continent,[177] and stressed that the U.S. should be on the side of anti-colonialism and self-determination.[178] Kennedy considered the [[Congo Crisis]] to be among the most important foreign policy issues facing his presidency, and he supported a [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] that prevented the secession of [[State of Katanga]].[179] [[Moïse Tshombe]], leader of Katanga, declared its independence from the Congo, and the Soviet Union responded by sending weapons and technicians to underwrite their struggle.[178] On October 2, 1962, Kennedy signed the United Nations bond issue bill to ensure U.S. assistance in financing UN peacekeeping operations in the Congo and elsewhere.[180]
In one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order]] 10924 that officially started the [[Peace Corps]].
He named his brother-in-law, [[Sargent Shriver]], as its first director.[181] Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing countries in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction.[182] Kennedy believed that countries that received Peace Corps volunteers were less likely to succumb to a communist revolution.[183] [[Tanganyika (1961–1964)]] (present-day [[Tanzania]]) and [[Ghana]] were the first countries to participate.[184] The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after.[185] Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 countries.[186][187]
His mistake helped raise tensions going into the [[Vienna summit]].[188] The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be [[Berlin]], which had been divided in two with the start of the Cold War.
The enclave of [[West Berlin]] lay within Soviet-allied [[East Germany]], but was supported by the U.S. and other Western powers.
Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and [[East Berlin]].
In the weeks immediately following the summit, more than 20,000 people [[Republikflucht]] to the western sector, reacting to statements from the Soviet Union.
Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.[192] In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25 billion (equivalent to $34.2 billion in 2024) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.[193]
A month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected [[Barbed-wire]] fences, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]].
In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.[194] A brief stand-off between U.S. and Soviet tanks occurred at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in October following a dispute over free movement of Allied personnel.
The [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]].[195] In remarks to his aides on the Berlin Wall, Kennedy noted that "it's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war."[196]
The Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro [[Cuban exile]][197][198] led by [[Central Intelligence Agency]] paramilitary officers.[199] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union.[200] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.[201]
On April 15, 1961, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] bombers left Nicaragua to bomb Cuban airfields.
The bombers missed many of their targets, leaving most of Castro's air force intact.[202] On April 17, the 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exile invasion force, known as [[Brigade 2506]], landed at beaches along the [[Bay of Pigs]] and immediately came under heavy fire.[203] The goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against Castro, but no such uprising occurred.[204] No U.S. air support was provided.[205] The invading force was defeated within two days by the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]];[206] 114 were killed and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors.[207] After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of $53 million worth of food and medicine.[208] The incident made Castro wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.[209]
Biographer [[Richard Reeves (American writer)]] said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations.
But maybe we'll learn something from it."[211] Kennedy's approval ratings climbed afterwards, helped in part by the vocal support given to him by Nixon and Eisenhower.[212] He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.[213] The Kennedy administration [[United States embargo against Cuba]] and convinced the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) to expel Cuba.[214]
In late 1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including [[Edward Lansdale]], Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and others.
The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[215] In November 1961, he authorized [[Operation Mongoose]].[216] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected [[Operation Northwoods]], proposals for [[False flag]] attacks against American military and civilian targets,[217] and blaming them on the Cuban government to gain approval for a war against Cuba.
In the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to Cuba.[218] The Soviet Union planned to allocate in Cuba 49 [[Medium-range ballistic missile]], 32 [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]], 49 light [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombers and about 100 [[Tactical nuclear weapon]].[219] The Kennedy administration viewed the growing [[Cuba–Soviet Union relations]] with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the U.S.[220] On October 14, 1962, CIA [[Lockheed U-2]] spy planes [[Aerial reconnaissance#Cold War]] of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba.
On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[223] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad-hoc body of key advisers, later known as [[EXCOMM]], that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[224]
More than a third of [[U.S. National Security Council]] (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but some saw this as "[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in reverse."[225] There was some concern from the international community (asked in confidence) that the assault plan was an overreaction, given that Eisenhower had placed [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958.
It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[226] In concurrence with a majority vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a [[Naval blockade]] (or "quarantine").
Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[229] UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period.
Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[230] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing pilot [[Rudolf Anderson]].[231]
At the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey "within a short time after this crisis was over."[232] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[233] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.[234]
In the aftermath, a [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] was established to ensure clear communications between the leaders of the two countries.[235] This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after, but "the humanity" of Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[236] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility.
Believing that "those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,"[238][239] Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the [[Alliance for Progress]], which sent aid to some countries and sought greater [[Human rights]] standards in the region.[240] In response to Kennedy's plea, Congress voted for an initial grant of $500 million in May 1961.[241] The Alliance for Progress supported the construction of housing, schools, airports, hospitals, clinics and water-purification projects as well as the distribution of free textbooks to students.[242] However, the program did not meet many of its goals.
The Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and [[Rafael Trujillo]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].
When Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include [[Plausible deniability]] by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[245] In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State [[Chester Bowles]] led a cautious reaction by the nation.
After the election, Eisenhower emphasized to Kennedy that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered [[Laos]] to be "the cork in the bottle" in regards to the regional threat.[247] In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a "free" Laos to a "neutral" Laos, indicating privately that [[Vietnam]] should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.[247] Though he was unwilling to commit U.S. forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve [[CIA activities in Laos]] designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the [[Hmong people]].[248]
During his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the [[South Vietnam]] government.[249] Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-communist South Vietnam after the [[1954 Geneva Conference]], but Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], increasing the number of U.S. [[Military advisors]] above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S. helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces.[250] On January 18, 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) – "Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)."[251] [[Operation Ranch Hand]], a large-scale aerial defoliation effort using the herbicide [[Agent Orange]], began on the roadsides of South Vietnam to combat [[Guerrilla warfare]].[252][253]
Though Kennedy provided support for South Vietnam throughout his tenure, Vietnam remained a secondary issue for the Kennedy administration until 1963.[254] On September 2, Kennedy declared in an interview with [[Walter Cronkite]] of [[CBS News]]:
Kennedy increasingly soured on the president of South Vietnam, [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], whose violent [[Buddhist crisis]] galvanized opposition to his leadership.
In August 1963, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] replaced [[Frederick Nolting]] as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam.
After the State Department sent a [[Cable 243]] to Lodge that ordered him to pressure Diem to remove military authority from his brother, [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], or face potential withdrawal of U.S. support and removal from power,[257] Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to a coup d'état, excluding assassination.[258] On November 1, 1963, a junta of senior military officers executed the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup d'état]] which led to the [[Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm]] on November 2.[259]
Kennedy rejected the full-scale deployment of ground soldiers but also the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.[264] Historians disagree on whether the U.S. military presence in Vietnam would have escalated had Kennedy survived and been re-elected in 1964.[265] Fueling the debate are statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the 2003 documentary film [[The Fog of War]] that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election,[266] and comments made by Kennedy administration [[White House Counsel]] and speechwriter [[Ted Sorensen]] in a 2008 memoir suggesting that Kennedy was undecided about what policy direction to take.[267][263]
On October 11, 1963, Kennedy signed [[National Security Action Memorandum 263]] ordering the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year following the third recommendation of the [[McNamara–Taylor mission]] report, which concluded that the training program for the South Vietnamese military had sufficiently progressed to justify the withdrawal.[268][269][270] However, NSAM 263 also approved the first recommendation of the report to continue providing support to South Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism and until the [[Viet Cong]] was suppressed, while the third recommendation suggested that even if the majority of the U.S. military objective was completed by the end of 1965 that continued presence of U.S. training personnel in more limited numbers could be necessary if the insurgency was not suppressed.[271][272][270]
In 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor [[Adenauer]].[273] At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence.[274][275][276] To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against [[NATO]]'s influence in Europe.[277]
But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us." The speech is known for its famous phrase "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]" ("I am a Berliner").[280]
Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had enforced on [[Israel]] in favor of increased security ties, becoming the founder of the [[Israel–United States military relations]].
Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Israel.[281] In 1962, the Kennedy administration sold Israel a major weapon system, the [[MIM-23 Hawk]].
In December 1961, [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]]'s Iraqi government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[Concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced (namely, the fields at [[Az Zubair]] and [[Kirkuk]]), effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession.
Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA—under the direction of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.]]—to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.[284]
The anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] overthrew and executed Qasim in [[Ramadan Revolution]] on February 8, 1963.
During his four-day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland beginning on June 26, 1963,[287] Kennedy accepted a grant of [[Achievement (heraldry)]] from the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]], received honorary degrees from the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]], attended a State Dinner in Dublin, and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of Wexford, Cork, Dublin, Galway, and Limerick.[288][289] He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near [[New Ross]], County Wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America.[290]
Kennedy was the first foreign leader to address the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament.[289][291][292] Kennedy later told aides that the trip was the best four days of his life.[293]
On June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers,[294] delivered the [[American University speech]].
Also known as "A Strategy of Peace", not only did Kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also "laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating [[Nuclear arms race]]."[295] Kennedy also announced that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and that the U.S. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.[296]
Troubled by the long-term dangers of [[Radioactive contamination]] and [[Nuclear proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.[297] In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September.
Averell Harriman]] to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[301] The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to [[Andrei Gromyko]].
Kennedy called his domestic proposals the "[[New Frontier]]".[305] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies.[306]
In 1961, Kennedy prioritized passing five bills: federal assistance for education, medical insurance for the elderly, housing legislation, federal aid to struggling areas, and an increase in the federal minimum wage.[307] Kennedy's bill to increase the [[Minimum wage in the United States]] to $1.25 an hour passed in early 1961, but an amendment inserted by conservative leader from Georgia, [[Carl Vinson]], exempted laundry workers from the law.[308] Kennedy also won passage of the [[Area Redevelopment Administration]] and the Housing Act of 1961.
The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394 million program, provided federal funding to economically struggling regions (primarily in [[Appalachia]]), while the Housing Act of 1961 provided funds for [[Urban renewal]] and [[Public housing]] and authorized federal [[Mortgage loans]] to those who did not qualify for public housing.[309] Kennedy proposed a bill providing for $2.3 billion in federal educational aid to the states, with more money going to states with lower [[Per capita income]].
Though the Senate passed the education bill, it was defeated in the House by a coalition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and Catholics.[310] Kennedy's health insurance bill, which would have paid for hospitalization and nursing costs for the elderly, failed to pass either house of Congress.[311] A bill that would have established the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] was also defeated.[312]
In 1962, Kennedy won approval of the [[Manpower Development and Training Act]], a three-year program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology.
Its impact on [[Structural unemployment]], however, was minimal.[309] At the urging of his sister [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], Kennedy made [[Intellectual disabilities]] a priority for his administration.
In 1963, Congress passed the [[Community Mental Health Act]], which provided funding to local mental health community centers and research facilities.[313]
The 1962 [[Trade Expansion Act]] was passed by Congress with wide majorities.
It authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to 50 percent with the [[European Common Market]].[314] The legislation paved the way for the [[Kennedy Round]] of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] negotiations, concluding on June 30, 1967, the last day before expiration of the Act.[315]
[[Walter Heller]], who served as the chairman of the CEA, advocated for a [[Keynesian economics]]-style tax cut designed to help spur economic growth, and Kennedy adopted this policy.[316] The idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues.[317] To the disappointment of liberals like [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], Kennedy's embrace of the tax cut shifted his administration's focus away from the proposed old-age health insurance program and other domestic expenditures.[318] In January 1963, Kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent.
The plan included reforms designed to reduce the impact of [[Itemized deduction]], as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped.
The [[Revenue Act of 1964]] lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent.[320]
Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep [[Interest rate]] down and to encourage growth of the economy.[321] He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession [[Government budget deficit]].[322] The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration.
Despite low [[Inflation]] and interest rates, the [[GDP]] had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.[323]
Kennedy was proud that his Labor Department helped keep wages steady in the steel industry, but was outraged in April 1962 when [[Roger Blough]], the president of [[U.S. Steel]], quietly informed Kennedy that his company would raise prices.[326] In response, Attorney General Robert Kennedy began a [[Price-fixing]] investigation against U.S. Steel, and President Kennedy convinced other steel companies to rescind their price increases until finally even U.S. Steel, isolated and in danger of being undersold, agreed to rescind its own price increase.[327] An editorial in The New York Times praised Kennedy's actions and stated that the steel industry's price increase "imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation."[328] Nevertheless, the administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the GDP as well as a net budget surplus.[329] The stock market, which had steadily declined since Kennedy's election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry took place.[330]
Kennedy verbally supported [[Civil rights]] during his 1960 presidential campaign; he telephoned [[Coretta Scott King]], wife of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter.
Robert Kennedy called Georgia Governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional Black support to his brother's candidacy.[331] Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation on taking office.[332] He needed their support to pass his economic and foreign policy agendas, and to support his reelection in 1964.[333] Kennedy did appoint many Blacks to office, including civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].[334] [[Abraham Bolden]], the first black [[United States Secret Service]] agent, was appointed by Kennedy.[335]
Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern Whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, and he distanced himself from it.[336] As articulated by Robert Kennedy, the administration's early priority was to "keep the president out of this civil rights mess."[337] Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,[334] especially concerning the [[Freedom Riders]].
In May 1961, the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], led by [[James Farmer]], organized integrated Freedom Rides to test a Supreme Court case ruling that declared segregation on interstate transportation illegal.[338] The Riders were repeatedly met with mob violence, including by federal and state law enforcement officers.[334] Kennedy assigned [[Federal marshal]] to protect the Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents.[334] Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up "hated memories of [[Reconstruction Era]]" among conservative Southern whites.[334] The Justice Department then petitioned the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) to adhere to federal law.
On March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 10925]], which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."[340] It established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission#Background]].[341]
In September 1962, [[James Meredith]] enrolled at the all-White [[University of Mississippi]] but was prevented from entering.
In response, Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals.[342] The [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]] left two dead and dozens injured, prompting Kennedy to send in 3,000 troops to quell the riot.[343] Meredith did finally enroll in class.
Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the "evils of Reconstruction" he had been taught or believed were true.[334] On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 11063]], which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing.[344]
On June 11, 1963, Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] blocked the [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]] to the [[University of Alabama]] to stop two Black students, [[Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from attending.
Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] and the [[Alabama National Guard]], which had just been federalized by order of the president.
That evening Kennedy gave his famous [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] speech on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.[345]
His proposals became part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].
The day ended with the murder of an NAACP leader, [[Medgar Evers]], in Mississippi.[346] As Kennedy had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader [[Carl Albert]] called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.[347] When Arthur Schlesinger Jr. complimented Kennedy on his remarks, Kennedy bitterly replied, "Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House." He then added, "But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did."[348] On June 16, The New York Times published an editorial which argued that while Kennedy had initially "moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment" in regards to civil rights he "now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life."[349]
A crowd of over 250,000, predominantly African Americans, gathered in Washington for the civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 28, 1963.
Edgar Hoover]] presented Kennedy with reports that some of King's close advisers, specifically [[Jack O'Dell]] and [[Stanley Levison]], were communists.[350] When King ignored the administration's warning, Robert Kennedy authorized the FBI to [[Wiretap]] King and other leaders of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].[351] Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so,"[352] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[353]
Three weeks later, on Sunday, September 15, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four Black children had died in the explosion, and two others were shot to death in the aftermath.[355] Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of Kennedy.
He called the congressional leaders to the White House, and by the following day, the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.[356] Gaining Republican support, Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate]].[357] On July 2, 1964, the guarantees Kennedy proposed in his June 1963 speech became federal law, when President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.[357]
During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy endorsed the concept of [[Equal pay for equal work]].[358] In December 1961, Kennedy signed an executive order creating the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] to advise him on issues concerning the status of women.[359] Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission.
The commission's final report was issued in October 1963; it documented the legal and cultural discrimination women in America faced and made several policy recommendations to bring about change.[360] On June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] and abolished wage disparity based on sex.[361]
Under the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the IRS to [[Organized crime]].
Kennedy won congressional approval for five bills (i.e., [[Federal Wire Act]] of 1961) designed to crack down on interstate [[Racket (crime)]], gambling, and the transportation of firearms.[362][363]
On March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law a bill abolishing the mandatory death penalty for [[First degree murder in the United States]] in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty.[364] The death penalty has not been applied in D.C. since 1957 and has now been abolished.[365]
Under the direction of Secretary of Agriculture [[Orville Freeman]], the administration sought to limit the production of farmers, but these proposals were generally defeated in Congress.
To increase demand for domestic agricultural products and help the impoverished, Kennedy launched a pilot [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] and expanded the [[National School Lunch Act]].[366]
Construction of the [[Kinzua Dam]] flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of [[Seneca nation]] land that they had occupied under the [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to [[Salamanca (town), New York]].
Kennedy was asked by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control.
In the aftermath of the Soviet launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first artificial Earth satellite, [[NASA]] proposed a crewed [[Moon landing]] by the early 1970s.[369] Funding for the program, known as the [[Apollo program]], was far from certain as Eisenhower held an ambivalent attitude.[370] Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the crewed space program, but he postponed any decision out of deference to Vice President Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the program in the Senate.[371] With [[Jerome Wiesner]], Johnson was given a major role in overseeing the administration's space policy, and at Johnson's recommendation, Kennedy appointed [[James E.
In Kennedy's [[State of the Union]] address in 1961, he suggested international cooperation in space.
Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.[373] In April 1961, Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind by the Soviet Union.[374] Less than a month later, [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American to travel into space, strengthening Kennedy's confidence in NASA.[375] The following year, [[John Glenn]], aboard the [[Project Mercury]] craft [[Friendship 7]], became the first American to orbit the Earth.[376]
He asked Johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the Soviets to the [[Moon]].
No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.[377] Full text [[Wikisource]]
Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a [[Kennedy Space Center]] for the [[Saturn V]] northwest of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], and a [[Lyndon B.
Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another [[We choose to go to the Moon]] promoting the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.[379] Full text [[Wikisource]]
On November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.[380] On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death, [[Apollo 11]] landed the first crewed spacecraft on the Moon.[381]
In 1962, Kennedy appointed justices [[Byron White]] and [[Arthur Goldberg]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].[382] Additionally, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 102 judges to the [[United States district court]].[383]
Kennedy was assassinated in [[Dallas]] at 12:30 p.m. [[Central Standard Time]] on November 22, 1963.[384] He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals [[Ralph Yarborough]] and [[Don Yarborough]] (no relation) and conservative [[John Connally]].[385] While traveling in a presidential [[Motorcade]] through [[Dealey Plaza]], he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.[386][387]
Kennedy was taken to [[Parkland Hospital]], where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later, at 1:00 p.m.[388] He was 46 years old.
[[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for the murder of police officer [[J.
Tippit]] and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination.[389] Oswald denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy.[390][391] On November 24, before he could be prosecuted, he was shot and killed by [[Jack Ruby]].[388] Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald.
President Johnson quickly issued an [[Executive order]] to create the [[Warren Commission]]—chaired by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]—to investigate the assassination.
The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[393][394] These conclusions are disputed by many.[395] A [[Gallup Poll]] in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone.[396] In 1979, the [[U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations]] concluded, with one third of the committee dissenting, "that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a [[John F.
This conclusion was based largely on audio recordings of the shooting.[397] Subsequently, investigative reports from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and a specially appointed [[National Academy of Sciences]] Committee determined that "reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman."[398] The [[United States Department of Justice]] later concluded "that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy".[399]
On November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the [[East Room]], where he lay in repose for 24 hours.[400][401] The coffin was then transported on a horse-drawn [[Limbers and caissons]] to the Capitol to lie in state.
Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands of people lined up to view the guarded casket,[402][403] with a quarter million passing through the [[United States Capitol rotunda]] during the 18 hours of lying in state.[402]
Kennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] in [[Washington, D.C.]][404] The [[Requiem]] was led by [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)]] [[Richard Cushing]], then the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]].[404] It was attended by approximately 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries.[405][406] After the service, Kennedy was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].[407]
The Kennedy family is one of the most established [[Political families]] in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and numerous other representatives and public officials.
This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) journey was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[408] Robert would eventually serve as his brother's [[United States Attorney General]] and closest presidential advisor;[408] he would later run for president in [[Robert F.
Kennedy 1968 presidential campaign]] before his [[Assassination of Robert F.
Kennedy]], while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in [[Ted Kennedy 1980 presidential campaign]].[409]
Kennedy met his wife, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], when he was a congressman.
Bartlett (journalist)]], a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.[410] They were married on September 12, 1953, at [[St. Mary's Church Complex (Newport, Rhode Island)]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].[411][412] The newlyweds honeymooned in Mexico before settling in their new home, [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)]], in [[McLean, Virginia]].[413] In 1956, they sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy's brother Robert, and bought a townhouse in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)]].[414][415] The Kennedys also resided at an apartment in [[Boston]], their legal residence during John's congressional career,[416][417] and a summer home in [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]].[418]
After a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 (their daughter Arabella), their daughter [[Caroline Kennedy]] was born in 1957.
Kennedy Jr. plane crash]].[419] In August 1963, Jackie gave birth to a son, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]]; however, he died after two days due to complications from birth.[420]
Kennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the [[Media culture]] in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of photo spreads in popular magazines.
Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast [[Live television]] and made good use of the medium.[421] In 1961, the [[Radio Television Digital News Association]] presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the [[Paul White Award]], in recognition of his open relationship with the media.[422]
[[Vaughn Meader]]'s First Family comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies.[425]
Kennedy was plagued by childhood diseases, including [[Whooping cough]], [[Chickenpox]], [[Measles]], and ear infections.
These ailments compelled him to spend a considerable amount of time [[Convalescing]].
Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with [[Scarlet fever]], a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to [[Boston City Hospital]].[426][14]
During his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at [[Yale New Haven Hospital]], where doctors suspected leukemia.[427] While ill, he became a passionate reader and also a [[Fatalist]].[428] In June 1934, he was admitted to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis was [[Colitis]].[427] After withdrawing from Princeton University, Kennedy was hospitalized for observation at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston.
He then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand outside [[Benson, Arizona]] under [[Jack Speiden]].[429]
Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947—at age 30 and during his first term in Congress—he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at [[The London Clinic]] with [[Addison's disease]].
Davis estimated that Kennedy would not live for another year, while Kennedy hoped he could live for ten.[430] In 1966, White House physician [[Janet Travell]] disclosed that Kennedy also had [[Hypothyroidism]].
The presence of two [[Endocrine disease]] raises the possibility that Kennedy had [[Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2]].[431]
His condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he was reportedly taking a combination of medications to manage the pain during the 1961 [[Vienna Summit]].
The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible side effects included hyperactivity, [[Hypertension]], impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[432] Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by three doctors, one of whom, [[Max Jacobson]], at first was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial[433] and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[434]
In 2002, [[Robert Dallek]] wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health based on a collection of Kennedy–associated papers from 1955 to 1963, including X-rays and prescription records from Travell.
injected and ingested [[Corticosteroids]] for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; [[Lomotil]], [[Metamucil]], [[Paregoric]], [[Phenobarbital]], [[Testosterone (medication)]], and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his [[Urinary-tract infection]] and an [[Abscess]]; and [[Tuinal]] to help him sleep.[427]
Kennedy was single in the 1940s and had relationships with Danish journalist [[Inga Arvad]][438] and actress [[Gene Tierney]].[439] During his time as a senator, he had an affair with [[Gunilla von Post]] who later wrote that the future president tried to end his marriage to be with her before he and his wife had any children.[440] Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with [[Marilyn Monroe]],[441] [[Judith Exner]],[442] [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]],[443] [[Marlene Dietrich]],[29] White House intern [[Mimi Alford]],[444] and his wife's [[Press secretary]], [[Pamela Turnure]].[445] Several conspiracy theories have surrounded [[Death of Marilyn Monroe]], alleging that Kennedy may have been involved.[446]
The full extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe—who in 1962 famously sang "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" at Kennedy's birthday celebration at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)]]—is not known, though it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at [[Bing Crosby]]'s house.[447] Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962.[448] J.
Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.[449] These included an alleged tryst with a suspected [[East Germany]] spy, [[Ellen Rometsch]].
According to historian [[Michael Beschloss]], in July 1963, Hoover reportedly informed Robert Kennedy about the affair with a woman "suspected as a Soviet intelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence." Robert reportedly took the matter seriously enough to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in Congress.[450][451] However, the FBI never turned up "any solid evidence" that Rometsch was a spy or that she had a relationship with President Kennedy.[452] Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman recalled "morale problems" that the president's indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.[453]
Kennedy was a fan of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Boston Celtics]].[457][458] Growing up on Cape Cod, Kennedy and his siblings developed a lifelong passion for [[Sailing]].[459] He also took up [[Golf]]; playing regularly at the [[Hyannisport Club]] in Massachusetts and the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida.[457][460]
Kennedy was the first [[Catholic]] elected to the presidency.[461] During his childhood, he attended [[St. Aidan's Church (Brookline, Massachusetts)]] in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he was [[Baptized]] on June 19, 1917.[462] From 1946 until he died in 1963, he served on the advisory board of the Roman Catholic [[Emmanuel College (Massachusetts)]].[463]
Historians and political scientists tend to [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary]] Kennedy as an above-average president, and he is usually the highest-ranking president who served less than one full term.[464] A 2010 survey by the [[Gallup Organization]], when Americans were asked their opinions of modern presidents, Kennedy was found to be the most-popular, with an 85 percent retrospective approval rating.[465] A 2014 survey from [[The Washington Post]] of 162 members of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Kennedy 14th highest overall among the 43 persons who have been president, including then-president [[Barack Obama]].
The survey found Kennedy to be the most overrated U.S. president.[466] A 2017 [[C-SPAN]] survey has Kennedy ranked among the top ten presidents.[467] A 2023 Gallup survey showed Kennedy with a retrospective approval rating of 90 percent, the highest of all U.S. presidents in recent history.[468] Assessments of his policies are mixed.[469][470] Many of Kennedy's legislative proposals were passed after his death, during the [[Presidency of Lyndon B.
Kennedy came in third (behind Martin Luther King Jr. and [[Mother Teresa]]) in [[Gallup's List of Widely Admired People]] of the 20th century.[472][473] In 1961, he was awarded the [[Laetare Medal]] by the [[University of Notre Dame]], considered the most prestigious award for [[American Catholics]].[474] He was posthumously awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]] ([[Latin]]: Peace on Earth) and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].[475]
Siracusa, the most popular theme surrounding Kennedy's legacy is its replay of the legend of [[King Arthur]] and [[Camelot]] from [[Arthurian Literature]].[477] In an interview following Kennedy's death, his widow Jacqueline mentioned his affection for the Broadway musical [[Camelot (musical)]] and quoted its closing lines: "Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot."[478][479] Critics, especially historians, have dismissed the Camelot myth as a distortion of Kennedy's actions, beliefs, and policies.
