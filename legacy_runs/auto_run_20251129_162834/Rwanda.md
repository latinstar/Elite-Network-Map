Rwanda,[a] officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a landlocked country in [[East Africa]].
The largest and most notable lakes are mainly in the western and northern regions of the country, and several volcanoes that form part of the [[Virunga Mountains]] volcanic chain are primarily in the northwest.
The climate is considered [[Highland temperate climate]], with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year.
Its [[Capital city]] and largest city is [[Kigali]], located at the centre of the country, at 1,567 metres above sea level.
Rwanda lies a few degrees south of the [[Equator]] in the [[Great Rift Valley]] of [[East Africa]], where the [[African Great Lakes]] and [[Southeast Africa]] converge.
Going clockwise Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the east, [[Burundi]] to the south, and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the west.
With a population of about 14 million people living within a total area of 26,338 square kilometres (10,169 sq mi), of which land accounts for about 93.7%, Rwanda is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density]] populated country in the world, with an average of about 578 people per square kilometre (1,500 per square mile).
[[Hunter-gatherer]] settled the territory in the [[Stone Age]] and [[Iron Age]], followed later by [[Bantu peoples]].
The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda]], and then into kingdoms.
In the 15th century, one kingdom, under King Gihanga, managed to incorporate several of its close neighbor territories establishing the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]].
In 1897, [[German colonial empire]] colonized Rwanda as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgium]], which took control in 1916 during [[World War I]].
The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution]] in 1959.
They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated republic in 1962 led by President [[Grégoire Kayibanda]].
A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état]] overthrew Kayibanda and brought [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] to power, who retained the pro-Hutu policy.
The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) launched a [[Rwandan Civil War]] in 1990.
Habyarimana was [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira]] in April 1994 by unknown parties.
Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide]] carried out by [[Hutu Power]] extremists against the Tutsis.
Rwanda has been governed by the RPF as a de facto [[One-party state]] since 1994 with former commander [[Paul Kagame]] as president since 2000.
The country has been governed by a series of centralized [[Authoritarianism]] since precolonial times.
Although Rwanda has low levels of corruption compared with neighbouring countries, it ranks among the lowest in international measurements of government transparency and civil liberties, despite recent gains that have elevated it to the medium category on the [[Human Development Index]].
The population is [[Youth in Rwanda]] and predominantly rural; Rwanda has one of the youngest populations in the world.
Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]].
However, within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]], and [[Great Lakes Twa]].
The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[African Pygmies]] and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants.
Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal and national language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by native Rwandans, with English, French, and Swahili serving as additional official foreign languages.
[[Coffee]] and [[Tea]] are the major [[Cash crop]] that it exports, although it is surpassed in banana production.
[[Tourism in Rwanda]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner.
As of the most recent survey in 2024, 30.5% of the population is affected by [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] with 27.4% under the national poverty line.
The country is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (one of few member states that does not have any historical links with the [[British Empire]]), [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], and the [[East African Community]].
The name Rwanda derives from the word Ku-aanda, meaning "expansion" or "spreading out from the centre", reflecting the historical growth of the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]].[15]
Modern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[Last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8,000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial]] which followed, up to around 3,000 BC.[16] Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[Hunter-gatherer]] in the late [[Stone Age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[Pottery]] and iron tools.[17][18] These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.
Then by 3,000 BC, [[Central Sudanic]] and [[Kuliak languages]] farmers and herders began settling into Rwanda, followed by [[South Cushitic languages]]–speaking herders in 2,000 BC.[19][20][21] The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.[22] Between 800 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.[21][23] Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.[24] An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.[21][25] Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.[26][27]
The earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda]] (ubwoko).[28] The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.[29] From the 15th century, the clans began to merge into kingdoms.[30] One kingdom, under King Gihanga, managed to incorporate several of its close neighbor territories establishing the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]].
By 1700, around eight kingdoms had existed in the present-day Rwanda.[31] One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-18th century.[32] The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the 19th century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV Rwabugiri]].
Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,[32][33] and initiated administrative reforms; these included [[Ubuhake]], in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,[34] and uburetwa, a [[Corvée]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.[33] Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.[33] The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,[22] but their numbers continued to decline.[35]
The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 assigned the territory to the [[German Empire]], who declared it to be part of [[German East Africa]].
In 1894, explorer [[Gustav Adolf von Götzen]] was the first European to cross the entire territory of Rwanda; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.[36][37] In 1897, Germany established a presence in Rwanda with the formation of an alliance with the king, beginning the colonial era.[38] The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy, and delegating power to local chiefs.[39][40]
[[Belgian colonial empire]] forces invaded Rwanda and [[Burundi]] in 1916, during [[World War I]], and later, in 1922, they started to rule both Rwanda and Burundi as a [[League of Nations mandate]] called [[Ruanda-Urundi]] and started a period of more direct colonial rule.[41] The Belgians simplified and centralised the power structure,[42] introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine.[43] Both the Germans and the Belgians, in the wake of [[New Imperialism]], promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different [[Race (human categorization)]].[44] In 1935, Belgium introduced an identity card system, which labelled each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised.
Belgium continued to rule [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a [[United Nations trust territories]] after the [[Second World War]], with a mandate to oversee eventual [[Decolonisation of Africa]].[46][47] Tensions escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 [[Rwandan Revolution]]: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses,[48] forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.[49][50] In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held [[1961 Rwandan monarchy referendum]] in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy.
Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence on 1 July 1962,[51] which is commemorated as Independence Day, a national holiday.[52] Cycles of violence followed, with mainly Tutsi [[Inyenzi movement]] attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu-led government retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi civilians inside Rwanda.[53] In 1973, [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] took power in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état]].
In 1990, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a rebel group composed of Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the [[Rwandan Civil War]].[57] The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government for failing to democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees.
Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war,[58] but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)]] with the RPF.[59]
The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira]] near Kigali Airport, killing him.[60] The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the [[Rwandan genocide]], which began within a few hours.
The Tutsi RPF restarted their offensive, and took control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July.[63] The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]].[64] When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]], in particular [[Zaïre]], fearing reprisals;[65] additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the [[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]].[66] Within Rwanda, a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and the reintroduction of [[Gacaca]], a traditional village court system.[67] Since 2000 Rwanda's economy,[68] tourist numbers,[69] and [[Human Development Index]] have grown rapidly;[70] between 2006 and 2011 the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45%,[71] while [[Life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000[72] to 65.4 years in 2021.[73]
In 2009, Rwanda joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], although the country was never part of the [[British Empire]].
On 25 January 2025, Rwanda broke off diplomatic ties with its neighbor, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], in support of the country's rebel groups, including the [[M23 Movement]].
Rwanda is a [[De facto]] [[One-party state]][74][75][76][77][78][79] ruled by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) and its leader [[Paul Kagame]] continuously since the end of the civil war in 1994.[80][81] Although Rwanda is nominally democratic, elections are manipulated in various ways, which include banning opposition parties, arresting or assassinating critics, and [[Electoral fraud]].[82] The RPF is a [[Tutsi]]-dominated party but receives support from other communities as well.[83]
Article 54 states that "political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination".[86] The [[President of Rwanda]] is the [[Head of state]],[87] and has broad powers including creating policy in conjunction with the [[Cabinet of Rwanda]],[88] commanding the [[Rwandan Defence Force]],[89] negotiating and ratifying treaties,[90] signing presidential orders,[91] and declaring war or a state of emergency.[89] The president is elected [[Elections in Rwanda]],[92] and appoints the [[Prime Minister of Rwanda]] and all other members of the Cabinet.[93] The [[Parliament of Rwanda]] consists of two [[Legislative chamber]].
It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee the activities of the president and the Cabinet.[94] The lower chamber is the [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)]], which has 80 members serving five-year terms.
Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by [[Universal suffrage]] under a [[Proportional representation]] system.[95]
Rwanda's legal system is largely based on [[Law of Germany]] and [[Law of Belgium]] [[Civil law (legal system)]] systems and [[Customary law]].[73] The judiciary is independent of the executive branch,[96] although the president and the Senate are involved in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.[97] Human Rights Watch has praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty,[98] but also alleges interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions.[99] The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised.[100] Ordinary courts are the [[Supreme Court of Rwanda]], the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts[100] and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations.[101] Between 2004 and 2012, a system of [[Gacaca court]] was in operation.[102] Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects.[103] The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.[104]
Rwanda has low corruption levels relative to most other African countries; in 2014, [[Transparency International]] ranked Rwanda as the fifth-cleanest out of 47 countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and 55th-cleanest out of 175 in the world.[105][106] The constitution provides for an [[Ombudsman]], whose duties include prevention and fighting of corruption.[107][108] Public officials (including the president) are required by the constitution to declare their wealth to the ombudsman and to the public; those who do not comply are suspended from office.[109] Despite this, Human Rights Watch notes extensive political repression throughout the country, including illegal and arbitrary detention, threats or other forms of intimidation, disappearances, politically motivated trials, and the massacre of peacefully protesting civilians.[110]
Rwanda is a member of the [[United Nations]],[111] [[African Union]], [[La Francophonie]],[112] [[East African Community]],[113] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].[114] For many years during the Habyarimana regime, the country maintained close ties with France, as well as Belgium, the former colonial power.[115] Under the RPF government, however, Rwanda has sought closer ties with neighbouring countries in the East African Community and with the English-speaking world.
Diplomatic relations with France were suspended in 2006 following the indictment of Rwandan officials by a French judge,[116] and despite their restoration in 2010, as of 2015[update] relations between the countries remain strained.[117] Relations with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] were tense following Rwanda's involvement in the [[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]];[66] the Congolese army alleged Rwandan attacks on their troops, while Rwanda blamed the Congolese government for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] provinces.[118][119] In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the [[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]], charges denied by the Rwandan government.[120] Relations soured further in 2012, as Kinshasa accused Rwanda of supporting the [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)]], an insurgency in the eastern Congo.[121] In 2015 peace had been restored and relations were improving,[122] but by January 2025 renewed Rwandan support for the M23 rebellion caused DR Congo to sever diplomatic relations in the wake of the [[2025 Goma offensive]].[123]
Rwanda's relationship with [[Uganda]] was also tense for much of the 2000s following a 1999 clash between the two countries' armies as they backed opposing rebel groups in the Second Congo War,[124] but improved significantly in the early 2010s.[125][126] In 2019, relations between the two countries deteriorated, with Rwanda closing its borders with Uganda.[127][128]
Before western colonization, the Rwandan government system had a [[Quasi-state]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)]] and power sharing.[129] Despite there being a strict hierarchy, the pre-colonial system achieved an established, combined system of "centralized power and decentralized autonomous units." Under the monarch, the elected Chief governed a province that was divided into multiple districts.
The [[List of kings of Rwanda]] (mwami) exercised control through a system of provinces, districts, hills, and neighbourhoods.[130]
As of 2003, the constitution [[Subdivisions of Rwanda]] Rwanda into [[Provinces of Rwanda]] (intara), [[Districts of Rwanda]] (uturere), cities, municipalities, towns, [[Sectors of Rwanda]] (imirenge), cells (utugari), and villages (imidugudu); the larger divisions, and their borders, are established by Parliament.[131] In January 2006, Rwanda was reorganized such that twelve provinces were merged to create five, and 106 districts were merged into thirty.[132] The present borders drawn in 2006 aimed at decentralising power and removing associations with the old system and the genocide.
The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography.[133] These are [[Northern Province, Rwanda]], [[Southern Province, Rwanda]], [[Eastern Province, Rwanda]], [[Western Province, Rwanda]], and the Municipality of Kigali in the centre.
They are divided into sectors, which are responsible for the delivery of public services as mandated by the districts.[136] Districts and sectors have directly elected councils, and are run by an executive committee selected by that council.[137] The cells and villages are the smallest political units, providing a link between the people and the sectors.[136] All adult resident citizens are members of their local cell council, from which an executive committee is elected.[137] The city of [[Kigali]] is a provincial-level authority, which coordinates urban planning within the city.[134]
Rwanda is located in [[East Africa]], in the east-central part of the [[Africa]] continent, between 1° and 3° S latitude and between 29° and 31° E longitude.
At 26,338 square kilometres (10,169 sq mi), Rwanda is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area]]-largest country, and the fourth smallest on the African mainland after [[Gambia]], [[Eswatini]], and [[Djibouti]].
It is comparable in size to [[Burundi]], [[Haiti]] and [[Albania]].[73][138] The entire country is at a high altitude: the [[List of countries by lowest point]] is the [[Rusizi River]] at 950 metres (3,117 ft) above sea level.[73]
The [[Congo-Nile Divide]] between the major [[Congo Basin]] and [[Nile Basin]] [[Drainage basin]] runs from north to south through Rwanda, with around 80% of the country's area draining into the Nile and 20% into the Congo via the [[Rusizi River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]].[139] The country's longest river is the [[Nyabarongo River Wetlands]], which rises in the south-west, flows north, east, and southeast before merging with the [[Ruvubu River]] to form the [[Kagera River]]; the Kagera then flows due north along the eastern border with Tanzania.
The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into [[Lake Victoria]], and its source in Nyungwe Forest is a contender for the as-yet undetermined overall [[Source (river or stream)]] of the [[Nile]].[140] Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being [[Lake Kivu]].
This lake occupies the floor of the [[Albertine Rift]] along most of the length of Rwanda's western border, and with a maximum depth of 480 metres (1,575 ft),[141] it is one of the twenty [[List of lakes by depth]].[142] Other sizeable lakes include [[Lake Burera]], [[Lake Ruhondo]], [[Lake Muhazi]], [[Lake Rweru]], and [[Lake Ihema]], the last being the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of [[Akagera National Park]].[143]
Mountains dominate central and western Rwanda and the country is sometimes called "Pays des mille collines" in French ("Land of a thousand hills").[144] They are part of the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the Albertine branch of the [[East African Rift]], which runs from north to south along Rwanda's western border.[145] The highest peaks are found in the [[Virunga Mountains]] volcano chain in the northwest; this includes [[Mount Karisimbi]], Rwanda's highest point, at 4,507 metres (14,787 ft).[146] This western section of the country lies within the [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] ecoregion.[145] It has an elevation of 1,500 to 2,500 metres (4,921 to 8,202 ft).[147] The centre of the country is predominantly rolling hills, while the eastern border region consists of [[Savanna]], plains and swamps.[148]
Rwanda has a [[Temperate]] [[Tropical climate]] climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries because of its high elevation.[149] Precipitation usually ranges from 1,000 to 1,400 millimetres per year, depending on the area.
These are separated by two [[Dry season]]: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February.[152] Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast.[153] [[Global warming]] has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons.
In prehistoric times[clarification needed], [[Montane forest]] occupied one-third of the territory of present-day Rwanda.
Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the [[National parks of Rwanda]], with [[Terrace (agriculture)]] dominating the rest of the country.[156] [[Nyungwe Forest]], the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as [[Orchid]] and [[Begonia]].[157] Vegetation in the [[Volcanoes National Park]] is mostly [[Bamboo]] and moorland, with small areas of forest.[156] By contrast, Akagera has a [[Savanna]] ecosystem in which [[Acacia]] dominates the flora.
There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including [[Markhamia lutea]] and [[Eulophia guineensis]].[158][159]
The greatest diversity of large mammals is found in the three national parks, which are designated conservation areas.[160] Akagera contains typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants,[161] while Volcanoes is home to an estimated one-third of the worldwide [[Mountain gorilla]] population.[162] Nyungwe Forest boasts thirteen primate species including [[Common chimpanzee]] and [[Black-and-white colobus]] arboreal monkeys; the Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400 individuals, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa.[163]
Rwanda's population of [[Lion]] was destroyed in the aftermath of the genocide of 1994, as national parks were turned into camps for displaced people and the remaining animals were poisoned by cattle herders.
In June 2015, two South African parks donated seven lions to [[Akagera National Park]], reestablishing a lion population in Rwanda.[164] The lions were held initially in a fenced-off area of the park, and then collared and released into the wild a month later.[165]
There are 670 [[List of birds of Rwanda]], with variation between the east and the west.[170] Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species, of which 26 are endemic to the Albertine Rift;[170] endemic species include the [[Rwenzori turaco]] and [[Handsome spurfowl]].[171] Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, features savanna birds such as the [[Black-headed gonolek]] and those associated with swamps and lakes, including [[Stork]] and [[Crane (bird)]].[170]
Recent entomological work in the country has revealed a rich diversity of [[Praying mantises]],[172] including a new species Dystacta tigrifrutex, dubbed the "bush tiger mantis".[173]
Rwanda contains three terrestrial ecoregions: [[Albertine Rift montane forests]], [[Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic]], and [[Ruwenzori-Virunga montane moorlands]].[174] The country had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 3.85/10, ranking it 139th globally out of 172 countries.[175]
The economy of Rwanda has expanded consistently since the [[Rwandan genocide]], with real GDP growth of 8.2% in 2023 and 8.9% in 2024, according to the [[National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda]].[176] Growth is projected at 7.1% in 2025 and 7.5% in 2026, and the government is actively pursuing policies to encourage industrial growth, such as the "Made In Rwanda".[177][178][179][180]
As of the most recent survey in 2024, 30.5% of the population are affected by [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] with 27.4% of the population under the national poverty line (monetary poverty), a significant drop from the monetary poverty of 60.3% in 2000.[181][182][183][184] Rwanda was classified in 2024 on the list of [[Least developed countries]] by the [[United Nations]], despite its graduation in the human assets aspect, Rwanda's [[List of countries by GNI (nominal) per capita]] (as an average over three years) and [[Economic Vulnerability Index]] ([[Agriculture]] and [[Landlocked country]]) are below the graduation threshold.[185][186]
Rwanda's economy is mainly driven by services, agriculture and industry, although agriculture ([[Subsistence agriculture]] and [[Cash crop]]) holds a larger share of employment than the other sectors (64.5%).
In 2023 its major export partners include [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[China]], [[India]] and the [[United States]], with the major exports being precious stones/metals, coffee, ores, oil and manufactured goods ([[Food processing]], cement, furniture, textiles and plastic pipes).[189][190][191][192] Its major import partners were [[China]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[India]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], with its major imports being oil, electric machinery, metals and industrial machinery.[190][191] Its monetary policy and financial management is controlled by the central [[National Bank of Rwanda]] and the currency is the [[Rwandan franc]]; in August 2025, the exchange rate was 1445 francs to one United States dollar, a currency which it created in 1964[193][194] Rwanda joined the [[East African Community]] in 2007, and has ratified a plan for [[Monetary union]] amongst the seven member nations,[195] which could eventually lead to a common [[East African shilling#Second East African shilling]].[196]
Crops grown in the country include [[Matoke]] (green bananas), which occupy more than a third of the country's farmland,[199] [[Potato]], [[Bean]], [[Sweet potato]], [[Cassava]], [[Wheat]] and [[Maize]].[199] Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and volcanic soils providing favourable conditions.[199] Reports have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans make their living from coffee plantation.[203] Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices.[204] Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each.[205] Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali.[205] Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output.
The industrial sector is currently experiencing growth, contributing 21.5% of GDP in 2014.[187] Products manufactured include cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles and cigarettes.[73] Rwanda's mining industry is an important contributor, generating US$93 million in 2008.[207] Minerals mined include [[Cassiterite]], [[Wolframite]], gold, and [[Coltan]], which is used in the manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones.[207][208]
Rwanda's [[Service sector]] suffered during the [[Late-2000s recession]] as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced.[209] The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP.[73] Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health.[209]
Rwanda was ranked 104th in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2025.[210][211]
A major draw for visitors is [[Mountain gorilla]] tracking in [[Volcanoes National Park]], one of only three places worldwide where mountain gorillas can be seen in the wild.[214] Other attractions include [[Nyungwe Forest National Park]], known for its chimpanzees and canopy walkway,[215] the resorts of [[Lake Kivu]], and [[Akagera National Park]], a savanna reserve in the east home to elephants, lions, and giraffes.
The government, through the Rwanda Development Board, has promoted tourism as a pillar of economic growth.[216] Visitor numbers have increased steadily since the early 2000s, with international arrivals often linked to conferences in Kigali as well as ecotourism.[217] In 2018, Rwanda launched the Visit Rwanda campaign, including sponsorship deals with European football clubs such as [[Arsenal F.C.]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.]], and [[Atlético Madrid]], to raise the country’s profile as a travel destination.[218][219][220]
In 2025, Visit Rwanda expanded its sports marketing into the United States, entering multi-year agreements with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (NBA) and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] (NFL).
The largest radio and television stations are state-run, and the majority of newspapers are owned by the government.[224] Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda.[224] As of 2015[update], the state-run [[Radio Rwanda]] was the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country.[224] Television access was limited, with most homes not having their own set.[225] The government rolled out [[Digital television]] in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era.[226] The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals.[224] Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of the government are widely available in Kigali.
The country's oldest telecommunications group, [[Rwandatel]], went into liquidation in 2011, having been 80% owned by Libyan company LAP Green.[228] The company was acquired in 2013 by Liquid Telecom,[229] a company providing telecommunications and [[Fibre optic]] networks across eastern and southern Africa.[230] In 2015, Liquid Telecom provided [[Landline]] service to 30,968 subscribers, with mobile operator [[MTN Rwanda]] serving an additional 15,497 fixed line subscribers.[231] Landlines are mostly used by government institutions, banks, [[Non-Government Organisation]] and embassies, with private subscription levels low.[232] In 2015, [[Mobile phone]] penetration in the country was 72.6%,[233] up from 41.6% in 2011.[234] MTN Rwanda is the leading provider, with 3,957,986 subscribers, followed by [[Tigo]] with 2,887,328, and [[Bharti Airtel]] with 1,336,679.[231] Rwandatel has also previously operated a mobile phone network, but the industry regulator revoked its licence in April 2011, following the company's failure to meet agreed investment commitments.[235] Internet penetration is low but rising rapidly; in 2015 there were 12.8 internet users per 100 people,[233] up from 2.1 in 2007.[236] In 2011, a 2,300-kilometre (1,400 mi) fibre-optic telecommunications network was completed, intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce.[237] This network is connected to [[SEACOM (African cable system)]], a [[Submarine communications cable]] fibre-optic cable connecting communication carriers in southern and eastern Africa.
Within Rwanda the cables run along major roads, linking towns around the country.[237] Mobile provider MTN also runs a [[Wireless internet]] service accessible in most areas of Kigali via pre-paid subscription.[238] As of 2024, the largest [[Internet]] providers are MTN and Airtel.
In October 2019, [[Mara Corporation]] launched the first African-made smartphone in Rwanda.[239] Following its launch in 2024, Airtel Rwanda, in cooperation with the Rwandan government, released the most affordable smartphone in the world, the Airtel Imagine 4G.
In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used.[242] Despite rainfall exceeding 750 millimetres (30 in) annually in most of the country,[243] little use is made of [[Rainwater harvesting]], and residents are forced to use water very sparingly, relative to usage in other African countries.[241] Access to [[Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda]] remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to [[Improved sanitation]],[244] with this statistic increasing to 92% for the total population (95% urban and 91% rural) in 2022.[245] Kigali is one of the cleanest cities in Africa.[246] Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas.[244] The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared [[Pit latrine]].[244]
Rwanda's electricity supply was, until the early 2000s, generated almost entirely from [[Hydroelectric]] sources; power stations on Lakes [[Lake Burera]] and [[Lake Ruhondo]] provided 90% of the country's electricity.[247] A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to a sharp drop in output from the power stations.[248] This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread [[Loadshedding]].[248] As an emergency measure, the government installed [[Diesel generator]] north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly.[248] The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%.[249] Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009.[250] The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.[251]
The government has increased investment in the [[Transport in Rwanda]] since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the United States, [[European Union]], Japan, and others.
The transport system consists primarily of the road network, with paved roads between Kigali and most other major cities and towns in the country.[252] Rwanda is linked by road to other countries in the East African Community, namely Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and [[Kenya]], as well as to the eastern Congolese cities of [[Goma]] and [[Bukavu]]; the country's most important trade route is the road to the port of [[Mombasa]] via [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]], which is known as the [[Northern Corridor]].[253] The principal form of public transport in the country is the [[Minibus]], accounting for more than half of all passenger carrying capacity.[254] Some minibuses, particularly in Kigali,[255] operate an unscheduled service, under a [[Shared taxi]] system,[256] while others run to a schedule, offering express routes between the major cities.
The principal private hire vehicle is the [[Motorcycle taxi]]; in 2013 there were 9,609 registered motorcycle taxis in Rwanda, compared with just 579 [[Taxicab]].[254] [[Coach (vehicle)]] services are available to various destinations in neighbouring countries.
The country has an [[Kigali International Airport]] at Kigali that serves several international destinations, the busiest routes being those to [[JKIA]] and [[Entebbe International Airport]];[257] there is one domestic route, between Kigali and [[Kamembe Airport]] near [[Cyangugu]].[258] In 2017, construction began on the [[Bugesera International Airport]], to the south of Kigali, which will become the country's largest when it opens, complementing the existing Kigali airport.[259] The national carrier is [[RwandAir]], and the country is served by seven foreign airlines.[257] As of 2015[update] the country had no railways, but there is a project underway, in conjunction with Burundi and Tanzania, to extend the Tanzanian [[Central Line (Tanzania)]] into Rwanda; the three countries have invited expressions of interest from private firms to form a [[Public private partnership]] for the scheme.[260] There is no public water transport between the port cities on Lake Kivu, although a limited private service exists and the government has initiated a programme to develop a full service.[261] The [[Ministry of Infrastructure (Rwanda)]] is also investigating the feasibility of linking Rwanda to [[Lake Victoria]] via shipping on the [[Akagera River]].[261]
As of 2025[update], Rwanda's estimated population is around 14.6 million, although estimates vary.[263][264] A decade earlier, in 2015, the estimated population was 11,262,564 (according to the [[National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda]]), and the 2012 census recorded a population of 10,515,973.[265][266] The population is young: as of 2024–2025, estimates of the median age ranged from 19.9 to 20.8, with 42.9% of the population under the age of 15, and 54.7% between 15 and 64.[267][268][73] In 2015, according to the CIA [[World Factbook]], the annual birth rate was estimated at 40.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants, and the death rate at 14.9.[73] The current life expectancy is between 68.2 and 70.54 years (71 years for females and 66 years for males), placing it 156th out of 224 countries and territories.[73][269] The overall sex ratio of the country is 95.9 males per 100 females.[73]
At 445 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,150/sq mi),[265] Rwanda's population density is amongst the highest in Africa.[270] Historians such as [[Gérard Prunier]] believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the population density.[56] The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country.[271] The only sparsely populated area of the country is the savanna land in the former province of [[Umutara Province]] and Akagera National Park in the east.[272] Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million.[273] Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development.[73][274][275] According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is [[Gisenyi]], which lies adjacent to [[Lake Kivu]] and the Congolese city of [[Goma]], and has a population of 126,000.[276] Other major towns include [[Ruhengeri]], [[Butare]], and [[Muhanga]], all with populations below 100,000.[276] The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990,[274] to 16.6% in 2006;[277] by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.[277]
Rwanda has been a unified state since pre-colonial times,[44] and the population is drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]];[278] this contrasts with most modern African states, whose borders were drawn by [[Colonisation of Africa]] and did not correspond to ethnic boundaries or pre-colonial kingdoms.[279] Within the Banyarwanda people, there are three separate groups, the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.[280] The CIA World Factbook gives estimates that the Hutu made up 84% of the population in 2009, the Tutsi 15% and Twa 1%.[73] The Twa are a pygmy people who descend from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants, but scholars do not agree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi.[281] Anthropologist Jean Hiernaux contends that the Tutsi are a separate race, with a tendency towards "long and narrow heads, faces and noses";[282] others, such as Villia Jefremovas, believe there is no discernible physical difference and the categories were not historically rigid.[283] In precolonial Rwanda the Tutsi were the ruling class, from whom the kings and the majority of chiefs were derived, while the Hutu were agriculturalists.[284] The current [[Government of Rwanda]] discourages the Hutu/Tutsi/Twa distinction, and has removed such classification from identity cards.[285] The 2002 census was the first since 1933[286] which did not categorise Rwandan population into the three groups.[287]
Following Rwanda’s accession to the [[East African Community]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], English became the main medium of instruction from 2009 onward.[292]
In 2013, the government established the [[University of Rwanda]] (UR) through the merger of the [[National University of Rwanda]] and other public higher education institutions.[293][294][295] In 2023, the [[Gross enrollment ratio]] for tertiary education was 8.89%, up from 3.6% in 2006.[296] Rwanda’s adult literacy rate, defined as the share of those aged 15 and above who can read and write, rose from 38% in 1978 to 58% in 1991, 71% in 2009, and 78.8% in 2022.[297][298]
The quality of healthcare in Rwanda has historically been very low, both before and immediately after the 1994 genocide.[299] In 1998, more than one in five children died before their fifth birthday,[300] often from [[Malaria]].[301]
President Kagame has made healthcare one of the priorities for the [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)]] development programme,[302] boosting spending on health care to 6.5% of the country's [[Gross domestic product]] in 2013,[303] compared with 1.9% in 1996.[304] The government has devolved the financing and management of healthcare to local communities, through a system of health insurance providers called mutuelles de santé.[305] The mutuelles were piloted in 1999, and were made available nationwide by the mid-2000s, with the assistance of international development partners.[305] Premiums under the scheme were initially US$2 per annum; since 2011 the rate has varied on a sliding scale, with the poorest paying nothing, and maximum premiums rising to US$8 per adult.[306] As of 2014[update], more than 90% of the population was covered by the scheme.[307] The government has also set up training institutes including the Kigali Health Institute (KHI), which was established in 1997[308] and is now part of the [[University of Rwanda]].
Between 2005 and 2013, life expectancy increased from 55.2 to 64.0,[310] under-5 mortality decreased from 106.4 to 52.0 per 1,000 live births,[311] and incidence of [[Tuberculosis]] has dropped from 101 to 69 per 100,000 people.[312] The country's progress in healthcare has been cited by the international media and charities.
[[The Atlantic]] devoted an article to "Rwanda's Historic Health Recovery".[313] [[Partners In Health]] described the health gains "among the most dramatic the world has seen in the last 50 years".[306]
Despite these improvements, however, the country's health profile remains dominated by communicable diseases,[314] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] has described "significant health challenges",[315] including the rate of maternal mortality, which it describes as "unacceptably high",[315] as well as the ongoing [[AIDS]] epidemic.[315] According to the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], travellers to Rwanda are highly recommended to take preventive malaria medication as well as make sure they are up to date with vaccines such as yellow fever.[316]
Rwanda also has a shortage of medical professionals, with only 0.84 physicians, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 residents.[317] The [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) is monitoring the country's health progress towards [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4–6, which relate to healthcare.
A mid-2015 UNDP report noted that the country was not on target to meet goal 4 on infant mortality, despite it having "fallen dramatically";[318] the country is "making good progress" towards goal 5, which is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio,[319] while goal 6 is not yet met as [[AIDS in Rwanda]] has not started falling.[320]
The largest faith in Rwanda is [[Catholicism]], but there have been significant changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to [[Evangelical]] Christianity, and, to a lesser degree, [[Islam in Rwanda]].[321] According to the 2012 census, Catholic Christians represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion.[322] Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence.
Many Rwandans view the [[God in Christianity]] as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God [[Imana]].[323]
The country's principal and national language is [[Kinyarwanda]], which is spoken by almost the entire population (about 98%).[324] Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak [[Shi language]], a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.[325]
During the colonial era, [[German language]] was the first European language introduced to Rwanda, though it was never widely used or taught.
After 1916, [[French language]] became dominant under Belgian administration and was used in government and education.
The 1962 Constitution made French an official language alongside Kinyarwanda.[326][327] [[Dutch language]] was also used in limited administrative contexts during the Belgian period.
The return of English-speaking Rwandan refugees from [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]] in the 1990s[326] reshaped the country's linguistic landscape and accelerated the shift toward English.[328] As Rwanda deepened its ties with the [[East African Community]] and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], English became increasingly important in education, business, and administration.
Today, [[Kinyarwanda]], [[English language]], [[French language]], and [[Swahili language]] are all official languages.[332] Kinyarwanda serves as the national and unifying language, while English is now the primary language of government, education, and business.
French remains in limited use in diplomacy and cultural contexts, and [[Swahili language]], the [[Lingua franca]] of the [[East African Community]],[333] is taught in schools and used in regional trade.
Homosexuality is generally considered a [[Taboo]] topic, and there is no significant public discussion of this issue in any region of the country.
Some cabinet-level government officials have expressed support for the rights of LGBT people;[340] however, no special legislative protections are afforded to LGBT people,[338] who may be arrested by the police under various laws dealing with public order and morality.[339] [[Same-sex marriage]] are not recognized by the state, as the [[Constitution of Rwanda]] provides that "[o]nly civil monogamous marriage between a man and a woman is recognized".[341]
Since 2006, Human Rights Watch has documented that Rwandan authorities round up and detain [[Street children]], street vendors, sex workers, homeless people, and beggars.
Unlike many other countries in Africa, Rwanda has been a unified state since precolonial times, populated by the [[Banyarwanda]] people who share a [[Kinyarwanda]] and cultural heritage.
[[Music of Rwanda]] and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling.
The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women;[343] the [[Intore]], or dance of heroes, performed by men;[343] and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ingoma.[344] The best-known dance group is the [[National Ballet of Rwanda]].
The most popular genre is [[Hip hop]], with a blend of [[Dancehall]], [[Rap]], [[Ragga]], [[Contemporary R&B]] and [[Dance-pop]].[348]
Woven baskets and bowls are especially common, notably the basket style of the [[Agaseke]].[349] [[Imigongo]], a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region was part of the independent Gisaka kingdom.
Rwanda does not have a long history of written literature, but there is a strong oral tradition ranging from poetry to [[Folk stories]].
Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations.[354] The most famous Rwandan literary figure was [[Alexis Kagame]] (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry.[355] The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as [[Benjamin Sehene]] and [[Fred Mfuranzima]].
A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the [[Golden Globe]]-nominated [[Hotel Rwanda]], [[100 Days (2001 film)]], [[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)]], [[Sometimes in April]], and [[Shooting Dogs]], the last four having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.[356][357]
Fourteen regular [[Public holidays in Rwanda]] are observed throughout the year,[358] with others occasionally inserted by the government.
The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning.[359] The victory for the RPF over the Hutu extremists is celebrated as [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July.
The last Saturday of each month is [[Umuganda]], a national morning of mandatory [[Community service]] lasting from 8 am to 11 am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people.[360] Most normal services close down during umuganda, and public transportation is limited.[360]
Rwanda's cuisine consists of [[Staple food]] produced by subsistence agriculture ([[Ibitoke]], [[Legume]], sweet potatoes, beans, cassava) and reflects other [[East African Community]] foods (mandazi, chapati).[361] For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, [[Tilapia]] is popular.[361] The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian [[Second European colonization wave (19th century–20th century)]], is very popular.[362] [[Ugali]], locally known as Ubugari (or umutsima) is common, a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a [[Porridge]]-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes.[363] Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and can be served with dried fish, rice, ugali, potatoes etc.[362] Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat.[364] [[Brochette]] are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes [[Tripe]], beef, or fish.[364] It's important to note however that many children in Rwanda are malnourished (1/3rd for children under five).[365]
In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and [[Barbecue]] the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.[366] Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country.[367] Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and [[Urwagwa]], made from bananas, and a soft drink called Umutobe which is banana juice; these popular drinks feature in traditional rituals and ceremonies.[362] The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is [[Bralirwa]], which was established in the 1950s, a Heineken partner, and is now listed on the [[Rwandan Stock Exchange]].[368] Bralirwa manufactures [[Soft drink]] products from [[The Coca-Cola Company]], under licence, including [[Coca-Cola]], [[Fanta]], and [[Sprite (soft drink)]],[369] and a range of beers including [[Primus beer]], [[Mützig beer]], [[Amstel Brewery]], and Turbo King.[370] In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing [[Skol]] beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu;[371] BMC is now owned by Belgian company [[Unibra]].[372] [[East African Breweries]] also operate in the country, importing [[Guinness]], [[Tusker (African beer)]], and Bell, as well as [[Whisky]] and [[Distilled beverage]].[373]
The Rwandan government, through its Sports Development Policy, promotes sport as a strong avenue for "development and peace building",[375] and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of development objectives, including education.[376] The most popular sports in Rwanda are [[Association football]], [[Volleyball]], [[Basketball]], [[Athletics (sport)]] and [[Paralympic sports]].[377] [[Cricket]] has been growing in popularity,[378] as a result of refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game.[379]
[[Cycling]], traditionally seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, is also growing in popularity [[Cycle sport]];[380] and Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, [[Rising from Ashes (film)]].[381][382]  The [[2025 UCI Road World Championships]] took place in Kigali in September 2025.
Rwandans have been competing at the [[Olympic Games]] since 1984,[383] and the [[Paralympic Games]] since 2004.[384] The country sent seven competitors to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, representing it in athletics, [[Swimming (sport)]], [[Mountain biking]] and [[Judo]],[383] and 15 competitors to the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] to compete in athletics, [[Paralympic powerlifting]] and [[Sitting volleyball]].[384] The country has also participated in the [[Commonwealth Games]] since joining the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 2009.[385][386] The country's [[Rwanda national basketball team]] has been growing in prominence since the mid-2000s, with the men's team qualifying for the final stages of the [[African Basketball Championship]] four times in a row since 2007.[387] The country bid unsuccessfully to host the [[2013 African Basketball Championship]].[388][389] Rwanda's [[Rwanda national football team]] has appeared in the [[African Cup of Nations]] once, in the [[2004 African Cup of Nations]] of the tournament,[390] but narrowly failed to advance beyond the group stages.[391] The team have failed to qualify for the competition since, and have never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]].[392] Rwanda's highest domestic football competition is the [[Rwanda National Football League]];[393] as of 2015[update], the dominant team is [[APR FC]] of Kigali, having won 13 of the last 17 championships.[394] Rwandan clubs participate in the [[Kagame Interclub Cup]] for Central and East African teams, sponsored since 2002 by President Kagame.[395]
