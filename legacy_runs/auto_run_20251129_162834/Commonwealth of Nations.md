The Commonwealth of Nations, often referred to as the British Commonwealth or simply the Commonwealth,[4]: 1 [5] is an [[International organization]] of [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]], the vast majority of which are former [[Territorial evolution of the British Empire]] of its predecessor, the [[British Empire]].[2] They are connected through their [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]] and their cultural and historical ties.
Its chief institutions are the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], focusing on intergovernmental relations, and the [[Commonwealth Foundation]], focusing on non-governmental relations between member nations.[6] Additionally, numerous intergovernmental and civil [[List of Commonwealth organisations]] operating amongst the Commonwealth countries are officially recognised by the Secretariat.[7]
The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Decolonisation]] of the Empire through the increased self-governance of its territories.
It was created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]],[8] and formalised by the United Kingdom through the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] in 1931.
In 1949, the [[London Declaration]] allowed India to remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, marking a significant evolution for the association.[9][10]
The [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is [[Charles III]].
He is king of 15 member states, known as the [[Commonwealth realm]], while 36 other members are [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations]], and five have different monarchs.
Although he became head upon the death of his mother, [[Elizabeth II]], the position is not technically hereditary.[11]
[[Commonwealth citizen]] enjoy benefits in some member countries, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], and Commonwealth countries are represented to one another by [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)]] rather than embassies.
The [[Charter of the Commonwealth]] defines their shared values of [[Democracy]], [[Human rights]] and the [[Rule of law]],[12] as promoted by the quadrennial [[Commonwealth Games]].
A majority of Commonwealth countries are [[Small power]], with [[Small Island Developing States]] constituting almost half its membership.
[[Queen Elizabeth II]], in her address to Canada on [[Canada Day]] in 1959, pointed out that the [[Confederation of Canada]] on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the "first independent country within the British Empire".
She declared: "So, it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations."[13] As long ago as 18 January 1884 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], while visiting [[Adelaide]], South Australia, had described the changing British Empire, as some of its colonies [[Responsible government#History in the British Empire and Commonwealth]], as a "Commonwealth of Nations".[14][15] Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from [[1887 Colonial Conference]], leading to the creation of the [[Imperial Conference]] in 1911.[16][17]
A specific proposal was presented by [[Jan Smuts]] in 1917 when he coined the term "the British Commonwealth of Nations" and envisioned the "future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence"[18] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)]], attended by delegates from the Dominions as well as the United Kingdom.[19][20] The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the [[Irish Free State]].[21]
In the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], the United Kingdom and its dominions agreed that they were "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations." The term '[[Commonwealth]]' was officially adopted to describe the community.[22]
These aspects of the relationship were formalised by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] in 1931, which applied to Canada without the need for ratification, but Australia, New Zealand and [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] had to ratify the statute for it to take effect.
Newfoundland later joined Canada as its [[Provinces and territories of Canada]] in 1949.[23] Australia and New Zealand [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]] and [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]] respectively.[24][25]
Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect, two laws — the [[Status of the Union Act, 1934]], and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act, 1934 — were passed by the [[Parliament of South Africa]] to confirm South Africa's status as a sovereign state, and to incorporate the Statute of Westminster into the [[Law of South Africa]].[26]
Commonwealth countries and the Empire were [[British Empire in World War II]] in every major theatre of the [[World War II]].
The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] was established for pilots from across the Empire and Dominions, created by the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.[27][28] Troops from Australia, Britain, the [[British Raj]] and New Zealand made up the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in post-war Japan.[29]
Most of its components have become independent countries, whether [[Commonwealth realm]] or republics, and members of the Commonwealth.
There remain the 14 mainly self-governing [[British overseas territories]] which retain some political association with the United Kingdom.
In April 1949, following the [[London Declaration]], the word "British" was dropped from the title of the Commonwealth to reflect its changing nature.[30]
[[Myanmar]] (Myanmar since 1989) and [[Colony of Aden]] (now part of Yemen) are the only states that were British colonies at the time of the war not to have joined the Commonwealth upon independence.
Former British [[Protectorate]] and [[League of Nations mandate]] that did not become members of the Commonwealth are Egypt (independent in 1922), Iraq (1932), [[Jordan]] (1946), [[Mandatory Palestine]] (part of which became the State of Israel in 1948), Sudan (1956), [[British Somaliland]] (which united with the former [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1960 to form the [[Somali Republic]]), Kuwait (1961), Bahrain (1971), Oman (1971), Qatar (1971) and the United Arab Emirates (1971).[31]
Furthermore, the loss of defence and financial roles undermined [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s early 20th-century vision of a world empire that could combine [[Imperial Preference]], mutual defence and social growth.
In addition, the United Kingdom's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly limited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore.[33] While British politicians at first hoped that the Commonwealth would preserve and project British influence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues [[Krishnan Srinivasan]].
Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-white member states became large-scale (see also: [[Commonwealth diaspora]]).[34]
The term "New Commonwealth" gained usage in the UK (especially in the 1960s and 1970s) to refer to recently [[Decolonised]] countries, predominantly non-[[White people]] and [[Developing country]] countries.
On 18 April 1949, Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]; in doing so, it also formally left the Commonwealth.[38] While Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth since the early 1930s, other dominions wished to become republics without losing Commonwealth ties.
The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a [[1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]].
Under the [[London Declaration]], as drafted by [[V.
Upon hearing this, King [[George VI]] told [[Krishna Menon]]: "So, I've become 'as such'."[39] Some other Commonwealth countries that have since become republics have chosen to leave, while others, such as [[Guyana]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Dominica]], have remained members.[40]
India's inaugural prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] declared on 16 May 1949, shortly following the Declaration, during the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] that:
Following India's precedent, other nations became republics, or [[Constitutional monarchies]] with their own monarchs.
The monarch is regarded as a separate [[Legal personality]] in each realm, even though the same person is monarch of each realm.[42][43][44][45]
At a time when Germany and France, together with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, were planning what later became the [[European Union]], and newly independent African countries were joining the Commonwealth, new ideas were floated to prevent the United Kingdom from becoming isolated in economic affairs.
In 1956 and 1957, the British government, under Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]], considered a "Plan G" to create a European free trade zone while also protecting the favoured status of the Commonwealth.[46][47][48]
At the time of the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, and in the face of colonial unrest and international tensions, French prime minister [[Guy Mollet]] proposed to British prime minister [[Anthony Eden]] that their two countries be [[Franco-British Union#Suez Crisis (1956)]].
When that proposal was turned down, Mollet suggested that France join the Commonwealth, possibly with "a common citizenship arrangement [[British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland]]".
The first member admitted without any constitutional link to the British Empire was [[Mozambique]] – a former [[Portuguese Mozambique]] – in 1995 following its first democratic elections.
Its entry preceded the [[Edinburgh Declaration]] and the current membership guidelines.[52] In 2009, Rwanda became the second country admitted to the Commonwealth without any constitutional links to Britain.
It was a [[Rwanda-Urundi]] that had been a district of [[German East Africa]] until [[World War I]].[53]
In 2022, [[Togo]], a former French mandate territory, and [[Gabon]], a former French colony, joined the Commonwealth, despite never having been under British rule.[54] Togolese foreign minister [[Robert Dussey]] expected Commonwealth membership to provide opportunities for Togolese citizens to learn [[English language]], and increase access to education and culture.
The country sought closer ties with the [[English-speaking world]].[55] In 2024 alone, trade between Togo and Britain increased by 94 percent; the country also sought to expand trade with India.[56][57] Meanwhile, Gabon was partially suspended from the Commonwealth in September 2023 [[2023 Gabonese coup d'état]], with two years given by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group for the country to hold new elections before a full suspension of its membership would be considered.[58][59] Gabon's partial suspension was lifted in July 2025, following a presidential election.[60]
Commonwealth relations saw renewed interest during the second term of United States president [[Donald Trump]].
In 2025, during [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Commonwealth countries Australia, Canada, Cyprus and New Zealand aligned themselves with the [[Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian War)]] spearheaded by British prime minister [[Keir Starmer]] to provide support for [[Ukraine]].[61][62][63][64] During the 2025 [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leadership contest in Canada, in light of aggressive actions taken by the United States, the ultimate victor [[Mark Carney]] expressed support for deepening relations with Britain, Australia and New Zealand.[65] Trump expressed interest in the United States becoming a member or "associate" member following tabloid reporting that this would be offered by Britain.[66]
Writing about America's shirking of global responsibility and the supposed ineffectiveness of the [[United Nations]], Australian-British lawyer [[Geoffrey Robertson]] opined that "Europe and the Commonwealth countries, plus Japan and Brazil and Indonesia, might together have more impact than the [[United Nations Security Council]] – if for example China moved to invade Taiwan."[67] In the midst of the [[Gaza war]], Commonwealth countries Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand imposed sanctions on two Israeli ministers, in tandem with Norway.[68]
Under the formula of the [[London Declaration]], [[Charles III]] is the [[Head of the Commonwealth]].[2][69] However, when the monarch dies, the successor to the crown does not automatically become the new head of the Commonwealth.[70] Despite this, at their meeting in April 2018, Commonwealth leaders agreed that [[Prince Charles]] should succeed his mother [[Elizabeth II]] as head after [[Death of Elizabeth II]].[71] The position is symbolic, representing the free association of independent members,[69] the majority of which (36) are [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations]], and five have monarchs of different [[Royal house]] ([[Brunei]], [[Eswatini]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Tonga]]).
The main decision-making forum of the organisation is the biennial [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), where [[List of Commonwealth heads of government]], including (among others) [[List of Commonwealth of Nations prime ministers]] and presidents, assemble for several days to discuss matters of mutual interest.
CHOGM is the successor to the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] and, earlier, the [[Imperial Conference]] and Colonial Conferences, dating back to 1887.
The head of government hosting the CHOGM is called the [[Commonwealth Chair-in-Office]] and retains the position until the following CHOGM.[72]
The [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], established in 1965, is the main intergovernmental agency of the Commonwealth, facilitating consultation and co-operation among member governments and countries.[73] It is responsible to member governments collectively.
The Commonwealth of Nations is represented in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] by the Secretariat as an [[United Nations General Assembly observers]].
The secretariat is headed by the [[Commonwealth secretary-general]], who is elected by the CHOG for no more than two four-year terms.
The present secretary-general is [[Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey]], from Ghana, succeeding [[Patricia Scotland]].
The first secretary-general was [[Arnold Smith]] of Canada (1965–1975), followed by Sir [[Shridath Ramphal]] of Guyana (1975–1990), Chief [[Emeka Anyaoku]] of Nigeria (1990–1999), [[Don McKinnon]] of New Zealand (2000–2008), and [[Kamalesh Sharma]] of India (2008–2016).
The United Kingdom and several others, mostly in the [[Caribbean]], grant [[Right of foreigners to vote]] to resident Commonwealth citizens.[75] Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have preferential citizenship acquisition or residency policies for Commonwealth citizens.[76][77][78] Initially, Commonwealth countries were not considered to be "foreign" to each other as their citizens were [[British subject]].[79][80][81] Citizenship laws evolved as the Commonwealth developed from the Empire.
In Australia, for the purpose of considering certain constitutional and legal provisions in the [[High Court of Australia]] case of [[Sue v Hill]], the United Kingdom was held to be a "foreign power".[82] Similarly, in Nolan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the nationals of other Commonwealth realms were held to be "aliens" though they were subjects of the Queen.[83]
Commonwealth citizens may receive [[Consular assistance]] from other Commonwealth countries.
In particular, British embassies and consulates may provide assistance to Commonwealth nationals in non-Commonwealth countries if their own country is not represented.[84] Commonwealth citizens are eligible to apply for [[British emergency passport]].[85] Australia issues [[Australian Document of Identity]] in exceptional circumstances to resident Commonwealth citizens who are unable to obtain valid travel documents from their countries of origin and must travel urgently.[86]
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the [[Supreme court]] of 14 Commonwealth countries, including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] which are under the [[Realm of New Zealand]] (though New Zealand itself does not make appeals to the Privy Council).[88]
Pacific Island states often appoint judges from other Commonwealth countries.[89][90] For instance, Commonwealth nationals are eligible for appointment to the [[High Court of Fiji]].[91][92]
Commonwealth citizens are eligible to serve in the [[British Armed Forces]].
According to the [[British Army]], "Commonwealth soldiers are, and always will be, an important and valued part of the fabric of the British Army."[93] Visa fees for Commonwealth personnel seeking to settle in Britain were scrapped in 2022.[94]
The [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] is a defence partnership between Commonwealth countries Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Britain.[95]
[[Gurkha]] soldiers from [[Nepal]], a non-Commonwealth country, have long served in the British Army and the forces of several Commonwealth countries.[96] They are employed by the British Army ([[Brigade of Gurkhas]]), [[Indian Army]] ([[Gorkha regiments (India)]]) and [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces]] ([[Gurkha Reserve Unit]]), as well the [[Gurkha Contingent]] of the [[Singapore Police Force]].
The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], as a fundamental founding document of the organisation, laid out that membership required dominionhood.
The 1949 [[London Declaration]] ended this, allowing republican and indigenous monarchic members on the condition that they recognised [[George VI of the United Kingdom]] as "[[Head of the Commonwealth]]".[99] In the wake of the wave of [[Decolonisation]] in the 1960s, these constitutional principles were augmented by political, economic, and social principles.
The first of these was set out in 1961, when it was decided that respect for [[Racial equality]] would be a requirement for membership, leading directly to the withdrawal of South Africa's re-application (which they were required to make under the formula of the London Declaration upon becoming a republic).
The 14 points of the 1971 [[Singapore Declaration]] dedicated all members to the principles of [[World peace]], [[Liberty]], [[Human rights]], [[Egalitarianism]], and [[Free trade]].[100]
These criteria were unenforceable for two decades,[101] until, in 1991, the [[Harare Declaration]] was issued, dedicating the leaders to applying the Singapore principles to the completion of decolonisation, the end of the [[Cold War]], and the end of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa.[102] The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], which created the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether members meet the requirements for membership under the Harare Declaration.[103] Also in 1995, an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full requirements for membership.
Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under the [[Edinburgh Declaration]], the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members would "as a rule" have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member.[104]
These requirements are that members must accept and comply with the [[Harare Declaration]], be fully [[Sovereign state]], recognise [[Charles III]] as head of the Commonwealth, accept the English language as the means of Commonwealth communication, and respect the wishes of the general population with regard to Commonwealth membership.[104] These requirements had undergone review, and a report on potential amendments was presented by the [[Committee on Commonwealth Membership]] at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007]].[105] New members were not admitted at this meeting, though applications for admission were considered at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2009]].[106]
In 2009, Rwanda, formerly under Belgian and German rule, joined.[53] Consideration for Rwanda's admission was considered an "exceptional circumstance" by the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]].[107] Rwanda was permitted to join despite the [[Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative]] (CHRI) finding that "the state of governance and human rights in Rwanda does not satisfy Commonwealth standards", and that it "does not therefore qualify for admission".[108] The CHRI commented that: "It does not make sense to admit a state that already does not satisfy Commonwealth standards.
In 2023, the Commonwealth had a population of 2.5 billion.[110] The Commonwealth is the largest association of '[[Third World]]' or '[[Global North and Global South]]' countries.[111]
The status was originally known as "[[Special membership of the Commonwealth of Nations]]", but was renamed on the [[Committee on Commonwealth Membership]]'s recommendation.[112] There are currently no members in arrears.
In 2019, the Commonwealth members had a combined [[Gross domestic product]] of over $9 trillion, 78% of which is accounted for by the four largest economies: India ($3.737 trillion), United Kingdom ($3.124 trillion), Canada ($1.652 trillion), and Australia ($1.379 trillion).[115]
In 1997 the Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed that, to become a member of the Commonwealth, an applicant country should, as a rule, have had a constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member; that it should comply with Commonwealth values, principles and priorities as set out in the [[Harare Declaration]]; and that it should accept Commonwealth norms and conventions.[116]
President [[Yahya Jammeh]] unilaterally withdrew the Gambia from the Commonwealth in October 2013.[119] However, [[2016 Gambian presidential election]] president [[Adama Barrow]] returned the country to the organisation in February 2018.[120]
Other eligible applicants could be any of the remaining inhabited [[British Overseas Territories]], [[Crown Dependencies]], [[Australian external territories]] and the [[Associated States of New Zealand]] if they become fully independent.[121] Many such jurisdictions are already directly represented within the Commonwealth, particularly through the [[Commonwealth Family]].[122] There are also former [[British possessions]] that have not become independent.
Although [[Hong Kong]] has become part of China, it continues to participate in some of the institutions within the Commonwealth Family, including the [[Commonwealth Lawyers Association]], the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel[123][124] and the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC).
In 2012, the [[States of Jersey]] called on the UK foreign secretary to request that the Commonwealth heads of government "consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy".
Jersey proposed that it be accorded "self-representation in all Commonwealth meetings; full participation in debates and procedures, with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings, which is reserved for full members".[125] The [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[Government of the Isle of Man]] made calls of a similar nature in the same year for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,[126] including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.[127] The [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man]] said that a "closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island's international relationships".[128]
Members can be suspended "from the Councils of the Commonwealth" for "serious or persistent violations" of the [[Harare Declaration]], particularly in abrogating their responsibility to have democratic government.[129] Suspensions are agreed by the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] (CMAG), which meets regularly to address potential breaches of the Harare Declaration.
[[Nigeria]] was suspended between 11 November 1995 and 29 May 1999,[130] following its execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] on the eve of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995]].[131] Pakistan was the second country to be suspended, on 18 October 1999, following the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état]] by [[Pervez Musharraf]].[132] The Commonwealth's longest suspension came to an end on 22 May 2004, when Pakistan's suspension was lifted following the restoration of [[Constitution of Pakistan]].[133] Pakistan was suspended for a second time, far more briefly, for six months from 22 November 2007, when Musharraf [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency]].[134] Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 over concerns regarding the electoral and land reform policies of [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] government,[135] before it withdrew from the organisation in 2003.[136] On 15 May 2018, Zimbabwe applied to rejoin the Commonwealth.[137]
The declaration of a Republic in [[Fiji]] in 1987, after [[1987 Fijian coups d'état]] designed to deny [[Indo-Fijians]] political power, was not accompanied by an application to remain.
Commonwealth membership was held to have lapsed until 1997, after discriminatory provisions in the republican constitution were repealed and reapplication for membership made.[138][139] Fiji has since been suspended twice, with the first imposed from 6 June 2000[140] to 20 December 2001 after [[2000 Fijian coup d'état]].[135] Fiji was suspended yet again in December 2006, following [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]].
At first, the suspension applied only to membership on the Councils of the Commonwealth.[138][141] After failing to meet a Commonwealth deadline for setting a date for national elections by 2010, Fiji was "fully suspended" on 1 September 2009.[138][141] The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, [[Kamalesh Sharma]], confirmed that full suspension meant that Fiji would be excluded from Commonwealth meetings, [[Commonwealth Games]] and the technical assistance programme (with an exception for assistance in re-establishing democracy).
Sharma stated that Fiji would remain a member of the Commonwealth during its suspension, but would be excluded from emblematic representation by the secretariat.[138] On 19 March 2014 Fiji's full suspension was amended to a suspension from councils of the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, permitting Fiji to join a number of Commonwealth activities, including the Commonwealth Games.[142] Fiji's suspension was lifted in September 2014.[143] The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group fully reinstated Fiji as a member following [[2014 Fijian general election]].[144]
Most recently, during 2013 and 2014, international pressure mounted to suspend Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth, citing grave human rights violations by the government of President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]].
There were also calls to change the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2013]] from Sri Lanka to another member country.
Canadian prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] threatened to boycott the event, but was instead represented at the meeting by [[Deepak Obhrai]].
UK prime minister [[David Cameron]] also chose to attend.[145][146] These concerns were rendered moot by [[2015 Sri Lankan presidential election]] of opposition leader [[Maithripala Sirisena]] as president in 2015.[147]
The first state to do so was Ireland in 1949 following its decision to [[The Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], although it had not participated in the Commonwealth since 1932.
At the time, all members accepted the [[British monarchy]] as head of state as a condition of membership.
This rule was changed after Ireland's departure to allow [[India]] to retain membership when it became a republic in 1950, although Ireland did not rejoin.
[[Pakistan]] left on 30 January 1972 in protest at the Commonwealth's recognition of breakaway Bangladesh, but rejoined on 2 August 1989.
Zimbabwe's membership was suspended in 2002 on the grounds of [[Human rights in Zimbabwe]] and deliberate misgovernment, and Zimbabwe's government terminated its membership in 2003.[148] The Gambia left the Commonwealth on 3 October 2013,[119] and rejoined on 8 February 2018.[120]
The Maldives withdrew from the Commonwealth on 13 October 2016,[149][150] citing the Commonwealth's "punitive actions against the Maldives since 2012" after the allegedly forced resignation of Maldivian President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] among the reasons for withdrawal.[150] Following the election of [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] as president in November 2018, the Maldives announced its intention to reapply to join the Commonwealth.[151] It rejoined on 1 February 2020.[152]
No country has been formally expelled from the Commonwealth.[153] However, South Africa's application to remain a member of the organisation after becoming a republic in 1961 was effectively blocked due to hostility from many members, particularly those in Africa and Asia as well as Canada, to [[Apartheid]].
The South African government withdrew its application when it became clear at the [[1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] that it would be rejected.[154] South Africa was re-admitted to the Commonwealth in 1994, following its [[1994 South African general election]] that year.
The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997 ended the territory's status as a part of the Commonwealth through the United Kingdom.
Hong Kong has nevertheless continued to participate in some of the organisations of the [[Commonwealth Family]], such as the [[Commonwealth Lawyers Association]] (hosted the Commonwealth Lawyers Conference in 1983 and 2009), the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] (and the Westminster Seminar on Parliamentary Practice and Procedures), the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel,[123][124] as well as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC).
The Commonwealth's objectives were first outlined in the 1971 [[Singapore Declaration]], which committed the Commonwealth to the institution of [[World peace]]; promotion of [[Representative democracy]] and [[Individual liberty]]; the pursuit of equality and opposition to racism; the fight against poverty, ignorance, and disease; and [[Free trade]].[156] To these were added opposition to discrimination on the basis of sex by the [[Lusaka Declaration]] of 1979,[100] and [[Environmental sustainability]] by the [[Langkawi Declaration]] of 1989.[157] These objectives were reinforced by the [[Harare Declaration]] in 1991.[158]
The Commonwealth's highest-priority aims concern the promotion of democracy and development, as outlined in the 2003 [[Aso Rock]],[159] which built on those in Singapore and Harare and clarified their terms of reference, stating, "We are committed to democracy, good governance, human rights, gender equality, and a more equitable sharing of the benefits of globalisation."[160]
The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] considered a report by a [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] (EPG) panel which asserted that the organisation had lost its relevance and was decaying due to the lack of a mechanism to censure member countries when they violated human rights or democratic norms.[162] The panel made 106 "urgent" recommendations including the adoption of a Charter of the Commonwealth, the creation of a new commissioner on the rule of law, democracy and human rights to track persistent human rights abuses and allegations of political repression by Commonwealth member states, recommendations for the repeal of [[LGBT rights by country or territory]] in 41 Commonwealth states and a ban on [[Forced marriage]].[163][164] The failure to release the report, or accept its recommendations for reforms in the area of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, was described as a "disgrace" by former British foreign secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]], a member of the EPG, who told a press conference: "The Commonwealth faces a very significant problem.
The result of the effort was that a new [[Charter of the Commonwealth]] was signed by Queen Elizabeth II on 11 March 2013 at Marlborough House, which opposes "all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds".[165][166]
In effect the United Kingdom procured £2.3 billion, of which £1.3 billion was from [[British Raj]].
By 1961, with a sluggish economy, the United Kingdom attempted to join the [[European Economic Community]], but this was repeatedly vetoed by [[Charles de Gaulle]].[175] [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities]] was finally achieved in 1973.
Historian [[Ben Pimlott]] argues that joining Europe "constituted the most decisive step yet in the progress of severance of familial ties between the United Kingdom and its former Empire...
The newly independent countries of Africa and Asia concentrated on their own internal political and economic development, and sometimes their role in the [[Cold War]].
Internal Canadian disputes revolved around the growing American cultural and economic presence, and the strong force of [[Quebec nationalism]].
In 1964, the [[Flag of Canada]] replaced the [[Canadian Red Ensign]], with Gregory Johnson describing it as "the last gasp of empire".[178] Australia and New Zealand were generally opposed to the United Kingdom's entry and exerted considerable influence on the eventual terms of accession in 1972, for which the United Kingdom agreed to transitional arrangements and monetary compensation to protect important export markets.[179][180] Russell Ward summarises the period in economic terms: "In fact the United Kingdom, as Australia's chief trading partner, was being very rapidly replaced just at this time by the United States and an economically resurgent Japan, but most people were scarcely aware of this....
Although the Commonwealth does not have a multilateral trade agreement, 2010 research by the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] showed that trade between Commonwealth countries is up to 50% greater on average than that between member and non-member countries.
Smaller and less wealthy states have a higher propensity to trade within the Commonwealth.[182] In 2024 alone, two years after Togo joined the Commonwealth, its trade with Britain increased by 94 percent.[56][57] At the 2005 Summit in Malta, the heads of government endorsed pursuing free trade among Commonwealth members on a bilateral basis.[183] Commonwealth Secretary-General [[Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey]] endorsed the ultimate creation of a Commonwealth free trade area in 2025.[184]
Following its [[Brexit]] to leave the [[European Union]],[185] some in the United Kingdom suggested the Commonwealth as an alternative to its EU [[Member state of the European Union]], and the government sought to increase trade within the association.[186][187] It was far from clear that this would offer sufficient economic benefit to replace trade with the EU, or that it would be acceptable to other member states.[188] Britain's first newly-negotiated trade deal was the [[Australia–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement]], signed in 2021.[189][190][191] In 2023, 10 percent of British exports went to the Commonwealth, whilst eight percent of its imports were from Commonwealth countries, with India being the most significant.[192]
Canada exempts most goods from the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]], consisting of Commonwealth countries and British Overseas Territories in the region, from import duties.[193]
Some, such as [[Sight Savers International]] and the [[English-Speaking Union]], also operate outside the Commonwealth, though their operations began and largely remain within the association.[194]
Formally accredited organisations include the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], which manages the [[Commonwealth Scholarship]] allowing students to study in other Commonwealth countries, and the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] which links together over 180 Commonwealth parliaments.[195]
The [[Commonwealth Foundation]] is an intergovernmental organisation, resourced by and reporting to Commonwealth governments, and guided by Commonwealth values and priorities.
The Foundation was established in 1965 by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]].
The Foundation is headquartered in [[Marlborough House]], [[Pall Mall, London]].
The Commonwealth Games, a [[Multi-sport event]], is held every four years; the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] were held in Gold Coast, Australia, [[2022 Commonwealth Games]] in Birmingham and [[2026 Commonwealth Games]] in Glasgow.
As well as the usual athletic disciplines, as at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], the games include sports particularly popular in the Commonwealth, such as [[Bowls]], [[Netball]], and [[Rugby sevens]].
Started in 1930 as the Empire Games, the games were founded on the Olympic model of [[Amateurism]], but were deliberately designed to be "the Friendly Games",[197] with the goal of promoting relations between Commonwealth countries and celebrating their shared sporting and cultural heritage.[198]
The games are the Commonwealth's most visible activity[197] and interest in the operation of the Commonwealth increases greatly when the Games are held.[199] There is controversy over whether the games—and sport generally—should be involved in the Commonwealth's wider political concerns.[198] The 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]] was signed to commit Commonwealth countries to combat [[Apartheid]] through discouraging sporting contact with South Africa (which was not then a member), while the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] were boycotted by most African, Asian, and Caribbean countries for the failure of other countries to enforce the Gleneagles Agreement.[200]
The [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] is the youth version of the Commonwealth Games and it is aimed at younger athletes aged between 14 and 18 years.
The [[2000 Commonwealth Youth Games]] was the inaugural edition of the Commonwealth Youth Games, first held in Edinburgh, Scotland.
The [[2023 Commonwealth Youth Games]] of the games was held in 2023 in Trinidad and Tobago.
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is responsible for maintaining the [[War grave]] of 1.7 million service personnel who died in the First and Second World Wars fighting for Commonwealth member states.
Founded in 1917 (as the Imperial War Graves Commission), the commission has constructed 2,500 [[War cemetery]], and maintains individual graves at another 20,000 sites around the world.[201] The vast majority of the latter are civilian cemeteries in the United Kingdom.
Commonwealth war cemeteries often feature similar [[Horticulture]] and architecture, with larger cemeteries being home to a [[Cross of Sacrifice]] and [[Stone of Remembrance]].
The Commonwealth of Learning (COL) is an intergovernmental organisation created by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] to encourage the development and sharing of open learning/distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.
CLGF works with national and [[Local government]] to support the development of [[Democracy]] and good local governance and is the associated organisation officially recognised by [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] as the representative body for local government in the Commonwealth.[205]
These commonalities are the result of the association's heritage, having developed out of the British Empire.[207][208] Symbols of the Commonwealth include the [[Flag of the Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Commonwealth Day]].
[[Remembrance Day]] is commemorated across the Commonwealth.[209][210] Celebrations for [[Guy Fawkes Night]] take place in some countries.[211]
In contemplating the British identity of the Commonwealth, Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui]] asked, "in the ultimate analysis, what could a New Zealander have in common with a Jamaican or a Zambian, if not the bonds of a shared British-ness?"[212][213][4]: 62
Many Commonwealth nations play similar sports that are considered quintessentially British in character, rooted in and developed under British rule or hegemony, including [[Cricket]], [[Association football]], [[Rugby football]], [[Field hockey]] and [[Netball]].
These ties are particularly strong between the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa across [[Rugby union]], [[Cricket]], [[Netball]], and [[Field hockey]], with Australia in [[Rugby league]], with the Caribbean nations in cricket and netball, and with the Indian subcontinent [[Cricket in the Indian subcontinent]] and hockey.
Canada does, however, maintain small enthusiastic communities in all the more traditional Commonwealth sports, having reached the World Cup in each of them, and is the homeplace of the [[Commonwealth Games]], hosting the [[1930 British Empire Games]] in 1930.[214]
Indeed, said rivalries preserved close ties by providing a constant in international relationships, even as the Empire transformed into the Commonwealth.[215] Externally, playing these sports is seen to be a sign of sharing a certain Commonwealth culture; the adoption of [[Rwanda Cricket Association]] was viewed as symbolic of the country's move towards Commonwealth membership.[216][217] Rwanda's membership of the Commonwealth was credited with helping to popularise the sport domestically, with both men and women playing it in orphanages, schools, universities and cricket clubs.[218]
The Commonwealth Games alongside the youth version, a quadrennial multi-sports event held in the middle year of an [[Olympic Games]] cycle is the most visible demonstration of these sporting ties.
In 1987, the Commonwealth Foundation established the annual [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] "to encourage and reward the upsurge of new Commonwealth fiction and ensure that works of merit reach a wider audience outside their country of origin".
Although not officially affiliated with the Commonwealth, the prestigious annual [[Booker Prize]], one of the highest honours in literature,[222] used to be awarded only to authors from Commonwealth countries or former members such as Ireland and Zimbabwe.
Since 2014, however, writers of any nationality have been eligible for the prize providing that they write originally in English and their novels are published by established publishers in the United Kingdom.[223] Today, the Commonwealth Foundation awards the annual [[Commonwealth Short Story Prize]].[224]
South African writer [[Olive Schreiner]]'s famous novel [[The Story of an African Farm]] was published in 1883 and New Zealander [[Katherine Mansfield]] published her first collection of short stories, [[In a German Pension]], in 1911.
The first major novelist from the [[Indian English literature]] to write in English, [[R.
Narayan]], began publishing in England in the 1930s, thanks to the encouragement of English novelist [[Graham Greene]].[225] Caribbean writer [[Jean Rhys]]' writing career began as early as 1928, though her most famous work, [[Wide Sargasso Sea]], was not published until 1966.
South African [[Alan Paton]]'s famous [[Cry, the Beloved Country]] dates to 1948.
[[Doris Lessing]] from [[Southern Rhodesia]], now Zimbabwe, was a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing from 1950 on throughout the 20th century.
She won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2007.[226]
[[Salman Rushdie]] is another post-Second World War writer from the former British colonies who [[Migrant literature]].
Rushdie achieved fame with [[Midnight's Children]] (1981).
His most controversial novel, [[The Satanic Verses]] (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad.
Naipaul]] (born 1932), born in [[Trinidad]], was another immigrant, who wrote, among other things, [[A Bend in the River]] (1979).
Many other Commonwealth writers have achieved an international reputation for works in English, including Nigerian novelist [[Chinua Achebe]], and playwright [[Wole Soyinka]].
Soyinka won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, as did South African novelist [[Nadine Gordimer]] in 1995.
Coetzee]] (Nobel Prize 2003) and playwright [[Athol Fugard]].
Kenya's most internationally renowned author is [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], author of novels, plays and short stories in English.
Poet [[Derek Walcott]], from [[Saint Lucia]] in the Caribbean, was another Nobel Prize winner in 1992.
An Australian, [[Patrick White]], a major novelist in this period, whose first work was published in 1939, won in 1973.
Other noteworthy Australian writers at the end of this period are poet [[Les Murray (poet)]], and novelist [[Peter Carey (novelist)]], who is one of only four writers to have won the [[Man Booker Prize]] twice.[228]
Most Commonwealth countries have a [[Westminster system]] of [[Parliamentary system]] democracy, with elected legislatures, multi-party elections, [[Responsible government]] and often two chambers.[229] The [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] facilitates co-operation between legislatures across the Commonwealth, and the [[Commonwealth Local Government Forum]] promotes [[Good governance]] among [[Local government]] officials.[230]
Most Commonwealth countries use [[Common law]], modelled on [[English law]].[232] The Latimer House Principles adopted in 2003 reflect the [[Separation of powers]].[233] Judges are appointed by independent commissions in most Commonwealth countries, a change which took place across the Commonwealth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and is reflected in the Cape Town Principles.[234]
The [[Flag of the Commonwealth]] consists of the symbol of the Commonwealth Secretariat, a gold globe surrounded by emanating rays, on a dark blue field; it was designed for the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973]] in 1973, and officially adopted on 26 March 1976.
1976 also saw the organisation agree to a common date on which to commemorate [[Commonwealth Day]], the second Monday in March, having developed separately on different dates from [[Empire Day]] celebrations.[235]
The lyrics of the Anthem are taken from the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].[236] The Commonwealth Youth Orchestra published renditions of the Anthem with and without an introductory narrative.[237][238]
In 2009, to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Commonwealth, the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] commissioned a poll of public opinion in seven of the member states: Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, South Africa and the United Kingdom.
It found that most people in these countries were largely ignorant of the Commonwealth's activities, aside from the [[Commonwealth Games]], and indifferent toward its future.
