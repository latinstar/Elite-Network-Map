The Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ; [[Arabic language]]: الجهاد الإسلامي المصري), formerly called simply Islamic [[Jihad]] (Arabic: الجهاد الإسلامي) and the Liberation Army for Holy Sites,[3] originally referred to as al-Jihad, and then the Jihad Group, or the Jihad Organization,[4] was an Egyptian [[Islamist]] [[Terrorist group]] active from the late 1970s until its 2001 merger with [[Al-Qaeda]].
It was long considered an affiliate of Al-Qaeda and under worldwide embargo by the [[United Nations]].[1] It was also banned by several individual governments worldwide.[5] The group is a proscribed terrorist group organization in the [[United Kingdom]] under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]].[6]
The organization's original primary goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an [[Islamic state]].
In June 2001, [[Al-Qaeda]] and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (which had been associated with each other for many years) merged into "Qaeda al-Jihad".[7] However, the [[UN]] states that there was a split in the organization when the merger was announced.[1]
Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], former leaders of the group in Egypt formed a political party, called the [[Islamic Party (Egypt)]], which  became a member of the [[Anti-Coup Alliance]] following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'etat]].[8]
Al-Jihad or "Tanzim al-Jihad" was formed in 1980 from the merger of two clusters of Islamist groups: a [[Cairo]] branch, under [[Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag]], and a Saidi (Upper Egypt) branch under Karam Zuhdi.[9] Farag wrote the 1980 book al-Faridah al-Ghaiba (The Neglected Obligation), setting forth the standards for EIJ, of which 500 copies were printed.[10]
After the assassination of Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]], the Egyptian government succeeded in rounding up the membership of Tanzim al-Jihad, but "was rather lenient in the ensuing trial".
In prison, the Cairenes and Saidis reverted into two factions; the Cairo militants later becoming the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Saidis later forming the [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], or the Islamic Group.
According to Zawahiri, the EIJ was "different from the [[Takfir wal Hijra]] group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins.
And we are different from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] because sometimes they do not oppose the government".[11]
The leader of the Cairo militants was [[Abbud al-Zumar]], "a onetime army intelligence officer serving a life sentence for his part in the plot to kill Sadat".
Most of the middle-rank members were discharged from prison after only three years and fled to [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] to help the mujahideen there and escape persecution at home.[13]
In the mid-1980s, in [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), the militants reconstituted themselves as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, "with very loose ties to their nominal imprisoned leader, [[Abbud al-Zumar]]".
A physician by the name of [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]] or "Dr. Fadl" was head of EIJ for some time,[14] although eventually, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], "whose leadership style was autocratic," would take over.
During this time EIJ became more extreme, with, for example, Dr. Fadl emphasizing the importance of [[Takfir]] and execution of apostates, which he argued should include those who registered to vote, since this was a violation of God's sovereignty over governance.[15]
It was also at this time that some saw "the Egyptians" of the EIJ begin to exert an influence on [[Osama bin Laden]], who at the time was known as a wealthy and well-connected fundraiser for the [[Jihad]] in Afghanistan.
Egyptian filmmaker Essam Deraz, "bin Laden's first biographer," met bin Laden in the "Lion's Den" training camp in Afghanistan and complained that the Egyptians "formed a barrier" around bin Laden and "whenever he tried to speak confidentially to bin Laden, the Egyptians would surround the Saudi and drag him into another room".[16] One of those who complained of being elbowed aside[17]  was a former mentor of bin Laden [[Abdullah Azzam]], the original exponent and organizer of global jihad on behalf of the Afghan mujahideen.[18]
At this point, [[Marc Sageman]] (a former foreign service officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987 to 1989), says "the EIJ became a free-floating network without any real ties to its original society or to its surrounding society".[19]
In August 1993, al-Jihad unsuccessfully attempted to kill the Egyptian Interior Minister, [[Hassan Al Alfi]], who was leading a crackdown on Islamic militants.
A bomb-laden motorcycle exploded next to the minister's car, fatally wounding Nazih Nushi Rashed and killing Tarek Abdel-Nabi (Dia al-Deen) instantly.[21][22] The attack marked the first time [[Sunni]] [[Islamists]] had made use of [[Suicide attack]], a technique made famous by [[Shia]] [[Hezbollah]] in [[Lebanon]].
It is "likely that the notion of suicide bombing" was inspired by Hezbollah as al-Zawahiri had been to [[Iran]] to raise money, and had sent his underling [[Ali Mohamed (double agent)]], "among others, to Lebanon to train with Hezbollah".[23]
A few months later in November, al-Jihad made another bombing attempt, this time to kill Egypt's prime minister, [[Atef Sidqi]].
The car bomb exploded close to a girls' school in [[Cairo]] as the minister was driven past.
Unfortunately for al-Jihad this bombing was preceded by two years of terror by a larger terror group ([[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]) that had killed 240, and the patience of the Egyptian public had run short.
EIJ's longtime association with [[Al-Qaeda]] became closer at this time when "most" of its members were reported to have gone "on the al-Qaeda payroll".
The leader of EIJ hoped this would be a temporary measure but later confided to one of this chief assistants that joining with [[Osama bin Laden]] had been "the only solution to keeping the Jihad organization abroad alive."[25]
Operating from its exile base in Sudan, EIJ joined forces with the Egyptian [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] and [[Sudanese intelligence]][26] in an attempt to kill Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] while he was in [[Ethiopia]] for a conference of the [[Organization of African Unity]].
[[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]] has claimed that Zawahiri was an agent for Sudanese intelligence services.[27] The leader of the plot was "[[Mustafa Hamza]], a senior Egyptian member of the [[Al-Qaeda]] and commander to the military branch of the Islamic Group".
They received assistance from [[Sudan]] intelligence services, which smuggled weapons into their embassy in Ethiopia.[28][29]
Their hope was to decapitate the Egyptian government thereby eliminating the "iron grip" of the [[State Security Investigations Service]], and creating a power vacuum which Islamists could then fill.
Back in [[Egypt]], Mubarak launched a ruthless campaign to crush anyone involved in Islamist terrorism,[29] but in Sudan the EIJ had even worse troubles.
In 1994, in a pamphlet written by Al-Zawahri, he alleges that, [[Ahmad Salama Mabruk]]'s 17-year-old son Musab, as well as the 15-year-old son Ahmed of [[Mohammed Sharaf]], were captured by the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate]] and sexually abused.
They were [[Blackmail]] with videotape of the sodomy until they agreed to act as informants against their fathers' group.
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] convened a [[Sharia]] court, where Musab confessed he had been given explosives by the Egyptians which he was told to detonate at the next [[Shura]] council meeting.
They were each found guilty of "sodomy, treason, and attempted murder", and sentenced to death by [[Firing squad]].
[[Osama bin Laden]] was also weakened by this failed operation.
The core of his [[Al-Qaeda]] group was made up of members of Islamic Jihad.
Because of Sudan's collaboration in the plot, the [[United Nations]] voted to impose sanction on the country.[32] To rehabilitate itself in the international community, the Sudanese government pressured bin Laden to leave the country.[28][33] Bin Laden and many EIJ returned to war-torn Afghanistan having lost many members and almost all of bin Laden's assets.[34]
On November 19, 1995, EIJ [[Attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan]] in Islamabad killing 16 and wounding 60.
The attack served as a prototype for future attacks by its sister organization al-Qaeda, such as the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]].
According to journalist Lawrence Wright, based on testimony given at the trial of the [[Albanians]] cell members in the late 1990s or early 2000s, EIJ membership had dwindled to 40 members outside Egypt, and none at all inside the country where "the movement had been eradicated".[35]
In 1998, three al-Jihad members were arrested in [[Albania]], and the United States intervened to ensure they were extradited to Egypt to face charges.[36] In Afghanistan Zawahiri wrote the 1998 fatwa for the "International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders," calling for the killing of Americans and their allies, both civilian and military, which was signed by representatives of several jihadi organizations, including EIJ.[37] In August 1998, [[Issam Abdel-Tawab]] was extradited to Egypt from Bulgaria.[38]
One of those who did abandon al-Jihad was Zawahiri's own brother [[Muhammad al-Zawahiri]], the military commander of EIJ.[39]
In June 2001, [[Al-Qaeda]] and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad merged into an entity formally called jamaa'at Qa'idat al-Jihad,[7] with the leadership of the EIJ having "the majority" – six of nine seats – "of al-Qaeda's ruling council ([[Shura]])."[40][41] However, [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]] has claimed that only 9 people from the organization, including Zawahiri, actually joined Al-Qaeda.[42]
It is responsible for the Egyptian Embassy bombing in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]] in 1995.
In 1998 a planned attack against the US [[Embassy]] in [[Albania]] was thwarted by a roundup of suspects who are now called the [[Returnees from Albania]].[citation needed]
Although [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] was "the one in front", Al-Sharif was the actual leader.[45] [[Nabil Na'eem]] was the leader of the group from 1988 until 1992.[46]
The al-Zawahiri faction subsequently formed an alliance with [[Al-Qaeda]] leading over time to the effective merger of the two groups operations inside Afghanistan.
The [[Government of Egypt]] claimed[when?] that both [[Iran]] and [[Osama bin Laden]] support the Islamic Jihad.
Unlike other militant counterparts, EIJ was noted for condemning only the government as apostate, and seeking to recruit soldiers, reporters and government workers who were untainted by [[Jahiliyya]].[10] [[Ba'athist Iraq]] agreed in March 1993 to renew relations with the group.[47]
