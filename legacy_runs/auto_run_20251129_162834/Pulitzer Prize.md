The Pulitzer Prizes[1] (/ˈpʊlɪtsər/ PUUL-it-sər)[2][a] are 23 annual awards given by [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] for achievements in the United States in "journalism, arts and letters".
They were established in 1917 by the will of [[Joseph Pulitzer]], who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher.[3]
Each winner receives a certificate and $15,000 in cash,[5] except in the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] category, where a [[Gold medal]] is awarded.[6][7]
Newspaper publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] gave money in his [[Will (law)]] to [[Columbia University]] to launch [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] and establish the Pulitzer Prize.
It allocated $250,000 to the prize and scholarships.[8] He specified "four awards in journalism, four in [[Literature]] and drama, one in education, and four traveling scholarships".[3]
After his death on October 29, 1911, the first Pulitzer Prizes were awarded June 4, 1917; they are now announced in May.[citation needed] The [[Chicago Tribune]] under the control of [[Robert R.
Works can only be entered in a maximum of two relevant categories, regardless of their properties.[11] Currently, entrants in the Book, Drama and Music categories must be United States citizens, [[Green card]] or those who otherwise consider the United States to be their longtime primary home; however, eligible work must be published by United States-based entities.[12] Entrants to the Journalism categories are not restricted by nationality, provided their submitted work appeared in a United States-based publication.[13]
Each year, more than 100 [[Jury]] are selected by the Pulitzer Prize Board to serve on 22 separate juries for the 23 award categories; one jury makes recommendations for both [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]].
Most juries consist of five members, except for those for [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]] and [[Pulitzer Prize for Audio Reporting]] categories, which have seven members; however, all book juries have five members.[3] For each award category, a jury makes three nominations.
[[Bill Dedman]] of [[NBC News]], the recipient of the [[1989 Pulitzer Prize#Journalism awards]], pointed out in 2012 that financial journalist [[Betty Liu]] was described as "Pulitzer Prize–Nominated" in her [[Bloomberg Television]] advertising and the jacket of her book, while [[National Review]] writer [[Jonah Goldberg]] made similar claims of "Pulitzer nomination" to promote his books.
Dedman wrote, "To call that submission a Pulitzer 'nomination' is like saying that [[Adam Sandler]] is an Oscar nominee if [[Columbia Pictures]] enters [[That's My Boy (2012 film)]] in the [[Academy Awards]].
Nominally, the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] is awarded only to news organizations, not individuals.
Reports and photographs by [[List of all newspapers in the United States]], [[List of United States magazines]] and [[News agency]] (including news websites) that "[publish] regularly"[18] are eligible for the journalism prize.
[[2007 Pulitzer Prize]], "an assortment of online elements will be permitted in all journalism categories except for the competition's two photography categories, which will continue to restrict entries to still images."[19] In December 2008, it was announced that for the first time content published in online-only news sources would be considered.[20]
Although certain winners with magazine affiliations (most notably [[Moneta Sleet, Jr.]]) were allowed to enter the competition due to eligible partnerships or concurrent publication of their work in newspapers, the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board and the eventual Pulitzer Prize Board historically resisted the admission of magazines into the competition, resulting in the formation of the [[National Magazine Awards]] at the Columbia Journalism School in 1966.
By 2016, this provision had expanded to three additional categories ([[Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] and [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]]).[21] That year, [[Kathryn Schulz]] (Feature Writing) and [[Emily Nussbaum]] (Criticism) of [[The New Yorker]] became the first magazine affiliates to receive the prize under the expanded eligibility criterion.[22]
In October 2016, magazine eligibility was extended to all journalism categories.[23] Hitherto confined to the local reporting of breaking news, the [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting]] category was expanded to encompass all domestic breaking news events in 2017.[24]
In 2020, the [[Pulitzer Prize for Audio Reporting]] category was added.
The first prize in this category was awarded to "The Out Crowd", an episode of the public radio program [[This American Life]].
In the second year, the Pulitzer was awarded for the [[NPR]] [[Podcast]] No Compromise.[26]
There have been dozens of [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards]]: more than ten each in Arts, Journalism, and Letters, and five for Pulitzer Prize service, most recently to [[Joseph Pulitzer, Jr.]] in 1987.
Over the years, awards have been discontinued either because the field of the award has been expanded to encompass other areas; the award has been renamed because the common terminology changed; or the award has become obsolete, such as the prizes for [[Telegraph]] reporting.
An example of a writing field that has been expanded was the former Pulitzer Prize for the Novel (awarded 1918–1947), which has been changed to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, which also includes [[Short story]], [[Novella]], [[Novella]], and poetry, as well as novels.
It comprises major editors, columnists and media executives in addition to six members drawn from academia and the arts, including the [[President of Columbia University]], the dean of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] and the [[Chief operating officer]] of the prizes, who serves as the board's secretary.
The administrator and the dean (who served on the board from its inception until 1954 and beginning again in 1976) participate in the deliberations as [[Ex officio]] members, but cannot vote.
Former [[Associated Press]] and [[Los Angeles Times]] editor Marjorie Miller was named administrator in April 2022.[28] She succeeded former [[The New York Times]] senior editor [[Dana Canedy]], who served in the role from 2017 to 2020.
Canedy was the first woman and first person of color to hold the position.[29][30] Edward Kliment, the program's longtime deputy administrator, was appointed acting administrator in July 2020 when Canedy became senior vice president and publisher of [[Simon & Schuster]]'s flagship [[Eponym]] imprint.[31] He chose not to contend for the position and returned to his previous role upon Miller's appointment.[28]
In addition to Canedy, past administrators include [[John Hohenberg]] (the youngest person to hold the position to date; 1954–1976), fellow Graduate School of Journalism professor Richard T.
Baker (1976–1981), former [[Newsweek]] executive editor [[Robert Christopher]] (1981–1992), former New York Times managing editor [[Seymour Topping]] (1993–2002), former [[Milwaukee Journal]] editor [[Sig Gissler]] (2002–2014) and former [[Concord Monitor]] editor [[Mike Pride (writer)]] (the only former board member to hold the position to date; 2014–2017).
Ackerman]]) and officials in Columbia's central administration, with the latter primarily under the aegis of [[Frank D.
Following the retirement of [[Joseph Pulitzer Jr.]] (a grandson of the endower who served as permanent chair of the board for 31 years) in 1986, the chair has typically rotated to the most senior member (or members, in the case of concurrent elections) on an annual basis.[32]
Since 1975, the board has made all prize decisions; prior to this point, the board's recommendations were subsequently ratified by a majority vote of the [[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York]].[33] Although the administrator's office and staff are housed alongside the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia's Pulitzer Hall and several administrators have held concurrent full-time or adjunct faculty appointments at the Journalism School, the board and administration have been operationally separate from the school since 1950.[34]: 121
2010 Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary [[Kathleen Parker]] wrote, "It's only because I'm a conservative basher that I'm now recognized."[66] [[Alexander Theroux]] describes the Pulitzer Prize as "an eminently silly award, [that] has often been handed out as a result of pull and political log-rolling, and that to some of the biggest frauds and fools alike."[67]
A 2012 academic study by journalism professors Yong Volz of the [[University of Missouri]] and Francis Lee of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] found "that only 27% of Pulitzer winners since 1991 were females, while newsrooms are about 33% female."[68] The researchers concluded female winners were more likely to have traditional academic experience, such as attendance at [[Ivy League]] schools, metropolitan upbringing, or employment with an elite publication such as The New York Times.
