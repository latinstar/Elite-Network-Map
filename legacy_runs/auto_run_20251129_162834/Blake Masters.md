Wade]] and Griswold and [[Planned Parenthood v.
Jackson Women's Health Organization]] U.S. Supreme Court case that overruled [[Roe v.
Wade]], Masters "scrubbed" his campaign website and "softened his rhetoric" by "rewriting or erasing five of his six positions" on abortion including the removal of his "100% [[Pro-life]]" text.[63] His position, as of August 2022, is that he favors "a federal personhood law that would ban abortions nationwide after the beginning of the third trimester", unless the life of the mother is at risk.[64]
Masters believes in reducing the amount of legal immigration.[66] He has asserted that Democrats want to deliberately engineer demographic replacement of American [[White people]] via immigration.

In March 2022, when Masters was asked by a podcast interviewer to name an "underrated subversive thinker", he named [[Ted Kaczynski]].[59] While clarifying that he did not endorse Kaczynski’s bombings, Masters said that [[Industrial Society and Its Future]], the domestic terrorist’s [[Manifesto]], contained "a lot of [correct] insight".[72][73] An Arizona-based GOP strategist told [[The Hill (newspaper)]] that the "Ted Kaczynski gaffe" was partly responsible for Masters' falling poll numbers.[73]

[[Donald Trump]] initially did not endorse Masters in the primary, instead supporting Hamadeh, an unsuccessful candidate for Arizona attorney general in 2022.[79] Masters caused controversy during the 2024 campaign for referring to Hamadeh, who identifies his faith as both [[Druze]] and [[Muslims]], as a "terrorist sympathizer."[80][81] Masters' attack ads showed Hamadeh in [[Saudi Arabia]], where he was stationed while serving in the [[United States Army]].[82] Trump later endorsed both Hamadeh and Masters in July, aligning with his running mate [[JD Vance]]'s support for Masters.[83]
