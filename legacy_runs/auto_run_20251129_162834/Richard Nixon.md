Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th [[President of the United States]], serving from 1969 until [[Resignation of Richard Nixon]] in 1974.
A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]], he represented [[California]] in both houses of the [[United States Congress]] before serving as the 36th [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Dwight D.
[[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] saw the reduction of U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[Détente]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]], the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing, and the establishment of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].
Nixon's second term ended early when he became the only U.S. president to resign from office, as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]].
Nixon was born into a poor family of [[Quakers]] in [[Yorba Linda]], Southern California.
He graduated from [[Whittier College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1934 and from [[Duke University School of Law]] with a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1937, practiced law in California, and then moved with his wife [[Pat Nixon]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1942 to work for the [[Federal government of the United States]].
After serving in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] during [[World War II]], he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[1946 California's 12th congressional district election]].
His work on the [[Alger Hiss]] case established his reputation as a leading [[Anti-communism]].
In 1950, he [[1950 United States Senate election in California]] to the [[United States Senate]].
Nixon was the running mate of Eisenhower, the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the [[1952 United States presidential election]] and  [[1956 United States presidential election]].
He narrowly lost the [[1960 United States presidential election]] to [[John F.
After his loss in the [[1962 California gubernatorial election]] race for governor of California, Nixon announced his retirement from politics.
However, he ran again for the presidency in [[1968 United States presidential election]] and defeated the Democratic candidate, Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]].
Seeking to bring the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table, Nixon ordered [[Cambodian campaign]] and [[Operation Menu]] in Cambodia.
He covertly aided Pakistan during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971 and ended American combat involvement in Vietnam in 1973, and the [[Conscription in the United States]] the same year.
His [[1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China]] in 1972 led to [[Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations]], and he finalized the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with the Soviet Union.
During the course of his first term, he enacted many progressive environmental policy shifts, such as creating the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and passing laws, including the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] and [[Clean Air Act (United States)]].
In addition to implementing the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, he ended the [[Bretton Woods system]] of the U.S. dollar to gold in 1971, effectively taking the United States off the [[Gold standard]].
He also imposed [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970]] for 90 days, launched the Wars on [[War on cancer]] and [[War on Drugs]], passed the [[Controlled Substances Act]], and presided over the end of the [[Space Race]] by overseeing the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
He was re-elected in [[1972 United States presidential election]], when he defeated [[George McGovern]] in [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin]].
In his second term, Nixon ordered [[Operation Nickel Grass]] to resupply Israeli materiel losses in the [[Yom Kippur War]], a conflict which led to the [[1973 oil crisis]] at home.
The scandal began with a break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] office, ordered by administration officials, and escalated despite [[Cover-up]] efforts by the Nixon administration, of which he was aware.
On August 9, 1974, facing almost certain [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon]] and removal from office, Nixon resigned.
Afterward, he was issued [[Pardon of Richard Nixon]] by his successor, [[Gerald Ford]].
On April 18, 1994, he suffered a debilitating [[Stroke]], and [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon]].
Nixon is generally [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] as a below-average president, mainly due to his role in the Watergate scandal.
Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in what was then the township precinct of [[Yorba Linda, California]],[1] in a house built by his father, on his family's lemon ranch.[2][3][4] His parents were [[Francis A.
Nixon]] and [[Hannah Milhous Nixon]].
His mother was a [[Quaker]], and his father converted from [[Methodism]] to the Quaker faith.
Through his mother, Nixon was a descendant of the early English settler [[Thomas Cornell (settler)]].[5]
He had four brothers: Harold, [[Donald Nixon]], Arthur, and [[Edward Nixon]].[6] Four of the five Nixon boys were named after British kings; Richard was named after [[Richard I of England]].[7]
Nixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in describing his boyhood: "We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it".[8] The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to [[Whittier, California]].
In an area of East Whittier with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station at what is now the corner of Whittier Boulevard and Santa Gertrudes Avenue.[9][10]  During this period, the Nixon family attended East Whittier Friends Church.[11]  Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness.[12] Richard was 12 years old when a spot was found on his lung; with a family history of [[Tuberculosis]], he was forbidden to play sports.
The spot turned out to be scar tissue from [[Pneumonia]].[13][14]
Nixon attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class.[15] His older brother Harold had attended [[Whittier High School]], which his parents thought resulted in a dissolute lifestyle.
They decided to send Nixon to the larger [[Fullerton Union High School]].[16][17] Though he had to ride a school bus an hour each way during his freshman year, he attained excellent grades.
Later, he lived with an aunt in [[Fullerton, California]] during the week.[18] He played junior varsity football and seldom missed practice, though he rarely was used in games.[19] He had greater success as a debater, winning several championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H.
Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend [[Harvard University]], but with Harold's continued illness requiring his mother's care until he died in 1933, Richard was needed at the store.
He remained in his hometown and enrolled at [[Whittier College]] in September 1930.
After graduating [[Latin honors#North America]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history from Whittier in 1934, Nixon was accepted at the new [[Duke University School of Law]],[27][28] which offered scholarships to top students, including Nixon.[29] It paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations.[30] The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, creating intense competition.[29] Nixon kept his scholarship, was elected president of the Duke Bar Association,[31] inducted into the [[Order of the Coif]],[32] and graduated third in his class in June 1937.[27][33]
After graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].
He received no response to his application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts.[34] He was admitted to the [[State Bar of California]] in 1937, and began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in the [[National Bank of Whittier Building]].[27][35]  His work concentrated on [[Commercial law]] for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on [[Will (law)]].[36] Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women.[37] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in [[La Habra, California]],[38] and became a full partner in the firm the following year.[39] In later years, Nixon proudly said he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney.[37]  During this period, Nixon was also the president of the Citra-Frost Company, which attempted to produce and sell frozen orange juice, but the company went bankrupt after 18 months.[40]
In January 1938, Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of [[The Dark Tower (play)]] in which he played opposite his future wife, a high school teacher named [[Pat Nixon]].[27] In his memoirs, Nixon described it as "a case of [[Love at first sight]]",[41] but apparently for Nixon only, since Pat Ryan turned him down several times before agreeing to date him.[42] Once they began their courtship, Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal.
After a honeymoon in [[Mexico]], the Nixons began their married life in Whittier.[43] They had two daughters: [[Tricia Nixon Cox]], born in 1946, and [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower]], born in 1948.[44]
In January 1942, the couple moved to the Northern Virginia suburbs, where Nixon took a job at the [[Office of Price Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]][27][45] In his political campaigns, Nixon suggested that this was his response to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941.
He did not enjoy the role, and four months later applied to join the [[United States Navy]].[47] Though he could have claimed an exemption from [[Conscription in the United States]] as a birthright Quaker, or a deferral due to his government service, Nixon nevertheless sought a commission in the Navy.
His application was approved, and he was appointed a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] on June 15, 1942.[48][49]
In October 1942, he was given his first assignment as aide to the commander of the [[Ottumwa Regional Airport#History]] in [[Wapello County, Iowa]], until May 1943.
Seeking more excitement, he requested sea duty; on July 2, 1943, he was assigned to [[Marine Aircraft Group 25]] and the [[South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command]] (SCAT), where he supported the [[Military logistics]] of operations in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]] during [[World War II]].[50][51][52]
On October 1, 1943, Nixon was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)]].[48] Nixon commanded the SCAT forward detachments at [[Vella Lavella]], [[Buin, Papua New Guinea#Japan and the USA during World War II]], and finally at [[Nissan Island]].[48][52] His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the transport aircraft.
For this service, he received a [[Commendation Medal]] and a Navy Commendation Ribbon, which was later updated to the [[Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal]], from his commanding officer for "meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command".
Upon his return to the U.S., Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]].
In January 1945, he was transferred to the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] office in [[Philadelphia]], where he helped negotiate the termination of World War II contracts, and received his second letter of commendation, from the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]][53] for "meritorious service, tireless effort, and devotion to duty".
Later, Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts, and he moved to Philadelphia, New York, and finally to Baltimore.[54][55] On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)]].[48][53] On March 10, 1946, he was relieved of active duty.[48] On June 1, 1953, he was promoted to [[Commander (United States)]] in the U.S. Naval Reserve, and he retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 6, 1966.[48]
While in the Navy, Nixon became a very good [[Five-card stud]] poker player, helping finance his first congressional campaign with the winnings.
In a 1983 interview, he described turning down an invitation to dine with [[Charles Lindbergh]] because he was hosting a game.[56][57]
Republicans in [[California's 12th congressional district]] were frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic representative [[Jerry Voorhis]], and they sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him.
After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, manager of Whittier's [[Bank of America]] branch, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on Whittier College's board of trustees before the war.
Perry wrote to Nixon in [[Baltimore]], and after a night of excited conversation with his wife, Nixon gave Perry an enthusiastic response,[58][59] confirming that he was registered to vote in California at his parents' Whittier residence.[60] Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee.
In June 1947, Nixon supported the [[Taft–Hartley Act]], a federal law that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and he served on the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]].
In August 1947, he became one of 19 House members to serve on the [[Herter Committee]],[63] which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid.
Nixon was the youngest member of the committee and the only Westerner.[64] Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the [[Marshall Plan]].[65]
In his memoirs, Nixon wrote that he joined the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) "at the end of 1947".
However, he was already a HUAC member in early February 1947, when he heard "Enemy Number One" [[Gerhard Eisler]] and his sister [[Ruth Fischer]] testify.
Kersten]] had introduced him to Father [[John Francis Cronin]] in Baltimore.
Sullivan]] who by 1961 headed domestic intelligence under [[J.
Edgar Hoover]].[67]
By May 1948, Nixon had co-sponsored the [[Mundt–Nixon Bill]] to implement "a new approach to the complicated problem of internal communist subversion ...
It provided for registration of all [[CPUSA]] members and required a statement of the source of all printed and broadcast material issued by organizations that were found to be Communist fronts." He served as floor manager for the Republican Party.
Nixon first gained national attention in August 1948, when his persistence as a House Un-American Activities Committee member helped break the [[Alger Hiss]] spy case.
While many doubted [[Whittaker Chambers]]'s allegations that Hiss, a former [[United States Department of State]] official, had been a [[Soviet Union]] spy, Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation.
After Hiss filed suit, alleging defamation, Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations, including paper and [[Microfilm]] copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after hiding them overnight in a field; they became known as the "[[Pumpkin papers]]".[70] Hiss was convicted of [[Perjury]] in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers.[71] In [[1948 California's 12th congressional district election]], Nixon successfully [[Cross-filed]] as a candidate in his district, winning both major party primaries,[72] and was comfortably reelected.[73]
In 1949, Nixon began to consider running for the [[United States Senate]] against the conservative Democratic incumbent, [[Sheridan Downey]],[74] and entered the race in November.[75] Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]], announced his retirement in March 1950.[76] Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections[77] and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing [[Korean War]] was a major issue.[78] Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas's liberal voting record.
As part of that effort, a "[[United States Senate election in California, 1950#Debut of the Pink Sheet]]" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that Douglas's voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman [[Vito Marcantonio]], reputed to be a communist, and their political views must be nearly identical.[79] Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points.[80] During the campaign, Nixon was first called "Tricky Dick" by his opponents for his campaign tactics.[81] After Nixon won, Downey resigned effective November 30, 1950; this enabled the governor to appoint Nixon on December 1, giving him a seniority advantage over other senators elected in 1950, whose terms started in January 1951.[82]
In the Senate, Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global [[Communism]], traveling frequently and speaking out against it.[83] He maintained friendly relations with [[Joseph McCarthy]], a controversial U.S. Senate colleague from [[Wisconsin]] and fellow [[Anti-communism]], but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations.[84] Nixon criticized President [[Harry S.
Truman]]'s handling of the [[Korean War]].[83] He supported statehood for [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]], voted in favor of civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for [[India]] and [[Yugoslavia]].[85] He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.[85]
Nixon's speech at a state Republican Party fundraiser in [[New York City]] on May 8, 1952, impressed Governor [[Thomas E.
Dewey]], who was an Eisenhower supporter and had organized a pro-Eisenhower delegation from New York to attend the [[1952 Republican National Convention]].[86] In a private meeting following the speech, Dewey suggested to Nixon that he would make a suitable vice presidential candidate to run alongside Eisenhower.[87] Eisenhower later indicated to Paul H.
Davis of the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]], an intermediary between candidates Eisenhower and [[Earl Warren]], that if he won the nomination, Nixon would be his first choice for the vice presidency, because Eisenhower believed the party needed to promote leaders who were aggressive, capable, and young.[88] Eisenhower later developed a list of seven potential candidates, with Nixon's name at the top.[89]
After Eisenhower was nominated, his key supporters met to discuss vice presidential possibilities.[89] Eisenhower informed the group's chairman, [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]] that he did not wish to appear to dictate to the convention by formally sponsoring a single candidate, so the group reviewed several, including [[Robert A.
Taft]], [[Everett Dirksen]], and [[Alfred E.
Driscoll]], all of whom they quickly rejected.[89] Dewey then raised Nixon's name; the group quickly concurred.[90] Brownell checked with Eisenhower, who indicated his approval.[91] Brownell then called Nixon to inform him that he was Eisenhower's choice.[90] Nixon accepted, then departed for Eisenhower's hotel room to discuss the details of the campaign and Eisenhower's plans for his vice president if the ticket was successful in the [[1952 United States presidential election]].[91]
The delegates soon assembled to formalize the selection.[92] Nixon asked Senator [[William Knowland]] to nominate him, and Knowland agreed.[92] After Senator [[John W.
On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke of his plans for the country, and left the negative campaigning to his [[Running mate]].[95] In mid-September, the Republican ticket faced a major crisis when the media reported that Nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses.[96][97] Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of a potential conflict of interest.
With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon's resignation from the [[Ticket (politics)]], Nixon went on television to address the nation on September 23, 1952.[98] The address, later named the [[Checkers speech]], was heard by about 60 million Americans, which represented the largest audience ever for a television broadcast at that point.[99] In the speech, Nixon emotionally defended himself, stating that the fund was not secret and that his donors had not received special favors.
And our little girl—Tricia, the 6-year-old—named it Checkers."[98] The speech prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon.[100] Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket,[101] and the ticket was victorious in [[1952 United States presidential election]].[95]
Eisenhower granted Nixon more responsibilities during his term than any previous vice president.[102] Nixon attended [[United States Cabinet]] and [[National Security Council (USA)]] meetings and chaired them in Eisenhower's absence.
He visited [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Hanoi]] in [[French Indochina]].[103] On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the time he devoted to foreign relations.[104]
Despite intense campaigning by Nixon, who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats, the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the [[1954 United States elections]].
The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had not yet been proposed, and the vice president had no formal power to act.
Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.[107] According to Nixon biographer [[Stephen Ambrose]], Nixon had "earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis ...
Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the president in the 1956 [[New Hampshire primary]] election.
In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.[109] Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the [[1956 United States presidential election]].[110]
On his return, he helped shepherd the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] through Congress.
Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did.[111] Eisenhower suffered a mild [[Stroke]] in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.[112]
On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon reluctantly embarked on a goodwill tour of [[South America]].
In [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy.
The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached [[Lima]], Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations.
Nixon went to the historical campus of [[National University of San Marcos]], the oldest university in the Americas, got out of his car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects.
At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him.[113] In [[Caracas]], Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and [[Attack on Richard Nixon's motorcade]] by a pipe-wielding mob.[114] According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct "caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect".[115] Reporting to the cabinet after the trip, Nixon claimed there was "absolute proof that [the protestors] were directed and controlled by a central Communist conspiracy." Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]], both concurred with Nixon.[116]
In July 1959, Eisenhower sent Nixon to the [[Soviet Union]] for the opening of the [[American National Exhibition]] in Moscow.
On July 24, Nixon was touring the exhibits with [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the "[[Kitchen Debate]]".[117]
In 1960, Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States, officially announcing on January 9, 1960.[118] He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries[119] and chose former Massachusetts senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] as his running mate.[120] His Democratic opponent was [[John F.
Kennedy]] and the race remained close for the duration.[121] Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the [[Presidency of Dwight D.
Eisenhower]] had [[Missile gap]].[122] While Kennedy faced issues about his Catholicism, Nixon remained a divisive figure to some.[123]
Televised [[1960 United States presidential debates]] made their debut as a political medium during the campaign.
In the first of four such debates, Nixon appeared pale, with a [[Five o'clock shadow]], in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy.[120] Nixon's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television, though many people listening on the radio thought Nixon had won.[124] Nixon narrowly lost the election, with Kennedy winning the popular vote by only 112,827 votes (0.2 percent).[120]
There were charges of [[Voter fraud]] in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy.
Nixon refused to consider contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world and that the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests.[125] At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, [[Six Crises]], which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.[120][126]
Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent [[Pat Brown]] for [[Governor of California]] in the [[1962 California gubernatorial election]] gubernatorial election.[120] Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race.[120] The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor.[120] Nixon hoped a successful run would confirm his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician and ensure he remained a major player in national politics.[127] Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career.[120]
In [[Richard Nixon's November 1962 press conference]], the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."[128] The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of [[Howard K.
Smith]]'s [[ABC News (United States)]] show, Howard K.
In 1963, the Nixon family traveled to Europe, where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited.[131] The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a [[Partner lawyer]] in the leading law firm [[Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon]].[120] On the morning of November 22, 1963, Nixon was in [[Dallas]], staying at the [[Baker Hotel (Dallas)]].
He left the city via [[Dallas Love Field]] an hour before the arrival of [[Air Force One]].[132] When announcing his California campaign, Nixon had pledged not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy, or after [[Assassination of John F.
In 1964, Nixon won write-in votes [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]], and was considered a serious contender by both Gallup polls[134][135] and members of the press.[136] He was even placed on a primary ballot as an active candidate by Oregon's secretary of state.[137] As late as two months before the [[1964 Republican National Convention]], however, Nixon fulfilled his promise to remain out of the presidential nomination process and instead endorsed Arizona senator [[Barry Goldwater]], the eventual Republican nominee.
In the [[1964 United States presidential election]], Goldwater lost in a landslide to Johnson and Republicans experienced heavy losses in Congress and among state governors.[138]
Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results, and he sought to build on that in the [[1966 United States elections]] in which he campaigned for many Republicans and sought to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide.
In 1967, Nixon was approached by an associate at his firm in [[Leonard Garment]] about a case involving the press and perceived invasion of privacy.
Hill]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].
Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the [[Vietnam War]], a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.[142]
An exceptionally tumultuous [[Partisan primary]] season began as the [[Tet Offensive]] was launched in January 1968.
Kennedy]], a Democratic candidate, [[Assassination of Robert F.
Romney]], though New York governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and California governor [[Ronald Reagan]] each hoped to be nominated in a [[Brokered convention]].
Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot.[144] He was able to secure the nomination to the support of many Southern delegates, after he and his subordinates made concessions to [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[Harry S.
Dent Sr.]].[145] He selected Maryland governor [[Spiro Agnew]] as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing both to Northern moderates and to Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.[146]
Nixon's Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], who was nominated at [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] marked [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity]].[147] Throughout the campaign, Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during this period of national unrest and upheaval.[147] He appealed to what he later called the "[[Silent majority]]" of [[Socially conservative]] Americans who disliked the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] and the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War]] demonstrators.
Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign, meeting with supporters in front of cameras.[149] He stressed that the crime rate was too high, and attacked what he perceived as a surrender of the United States' nuclear superiority by the Democrats.[150] Nixon promised "[[Peace with honor]]" in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that "new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific".[151] He did not give specifics of how he hoped to end the war, resulting in media intimations that he must have a "secret plan".[151] His slogan of "Nixon's the One" proved to be effective.[149]
On October 22, 1968, candidate Nixon received information that Johnson was preparing a so-called "[[October surprise]]", abandoning three non-negotiable conditions for a bombing halt, to help elect Humphrey in the last days of the campaign.[152] Whether the Nixon campaign interfered with negotiations between the Johnson administration and the South Vietnamese by engaging [[Anna Chennault]], a fundraiser for the Republican party, remains a controversy.[152] It is not clear whether the government of South Vietnam needed encouragement to opt out of a peace process they considered disadvantageous.[153]
In a three-way race between Nixon, Humphrey, and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]], Nixon defeated Humphrey by only 500,000 votes, a margin almost as close as in 1960, with both elections seeing a gap of less than one percentage point of the popular vote.
However, Nixon earned 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace, a majority.[147][154] He became the first non-incumbent vice president to be elected president.[155] In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try to [[Bring Us Together]].[156] Nixon said: "I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election.
Nixon [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon]] as [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival, [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[Earl Warren]].
Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at [[Book of Isaiah]] 2:4, which reads, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks." In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that "the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker"[158]—a phrase that found a place on his gravestone.[159] He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:
Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in [[Foreign Affairs]] a year before his election: "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation."[161] Among the reasons that Nixon sought to improve relations with China was in the hope of weakening the Soviet Union and decreasing China's support to the North in the Vietnam War.[162] Nixon ultimately used the idea of gaining leverage against the Soviet Union through relations with China to obtain the support of key conservative figures including Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.[163]
Assisting him in pursuing relations with China was [[Henry Kissinger]], Nixon's [[National Security Advisor (United States)]] and future [[United States Secretary of State]].
With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir—[[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] took place during Nixon's first year in office—Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations.
A breakthrough came in early 1971, when [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) [[Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]] [[Mao Zedong]] invited a team of American table tennis players [[Ping-pong diplomacy]].
In February 1972, Nixon and his wife traveled to China after Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation.[166] Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from [[Air Force One]] and were greeted by Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]].
Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-secretary of state [[John Foster Dulles]] had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva.[167] More than a hundred television journalists accompanied the president.
Nixon and Kissinger immediately met for an hour with CCP Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and Premier Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues.[168] Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon's forthrightness, unlike the leftists and the Soviets.[168] He said he was suspicious of Kissinger,[168] though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his "encounter with history".[167] A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the [[Great Hall of the People]].
The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the [[Shanghai Communiqué]] following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification.[169] When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders, including the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Ming tombs]], and the [[Great Wall of China]].[167] Americans took their first glance into everyday Chinese life through the cameras that accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals.[167]
The visit ushered in a new era of [[China–United States relations]].[147] Fearing the possibility of a US–China alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for [[Détente]] with the United States.[170] This was one component of [[Triangular diplomacy]].[171]
Nixon approved a secret [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] carpet bombing campaign of North Vietnamese and [[Khmer Rouge]] positions in Cambodia beginning in March 1969 and code-named [[Operation Menu]], without the consent of Cambodian leader [[Norodom Sihanouk]].[175][176][177] In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to their leaders, and peace talks began in Paris.
Initial talks did not result in an agreement,[178] and in May 1969, he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam, provided North Vietnam did so, and suggested South Vietnam hold internationally supervised elections with [[Viet Cong]] participation.[179]
In July 1969, Nixon visited [[South Vietnam]], where he met with his U.S. military commanders and President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]].
Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout, he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops with [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], known as "[[Vietnamization]]".[147] He soon instituted phased U.S. troop withdrawals,[180] but also authorized incursions into Laos, in part to interrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] passing through Laos and Cambodia and used to supply North Vietnamese forces.
In March 1970, at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then-second-in-command, [[Nuon Chea]], North Vietnamese troops launched an offensive and overran much of Cambodia.[181] Nixon announced the [[Cambodian campaign]] on April 30, 1970, against North Vietnamese bases in the east of the country,[182] and further protests erupted against perceived expansion of the conflict, which resulted in Ohio National Guardsmen killing four unarmed students at [[Kent State shootings]].[183] Nixon's responses to protesters included [[Richard Nixon's visit to the Lincoln Memorial]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on May 9, 1970.[184][185][186] Nixon's campaign promise to curb the war, contrasted with the escalated bombing, led to claims that Nixon had a "[[Credibility gap]]" on the issue.[180] It is estimated that between 50,000 and 150,000 people were killed during the [[Operation Freedom Deal]] between 1970 and 1973.[176]
In 1971, excerpts from the "[[Pentagon Papers]]", which had been leaked by [[Daniel Ellsberg]], were published by [[The New York Times]] and [[The Washington Post]].
When news of the leak first appeared, Nixon was inclined to do nothing; [[Pentagon Papers]], a history of the United States' involvement in Vietnam, mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations.
As U.S. troop withdrawals continued, [[Conscription in the United States]] was phased out by 1973, and the armed forces became all-volunteer.[188] After years of fighting, the [[Paris Peace Accords]] were signed at the beginning of 1973.
The agreement implemented a ceasefire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the withdrawal of the 160,000 [[North Vietnam Army]] regulars located in the South.[189] Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting resumed, and [[1975 spring offensive]].[190]
Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy during the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].
On taking office in 1969, he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, [[Fidel Castro]].
He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, [[Charles Rebozo]], who often suggested ways of irritating Castro.
The process was not completed before the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970.
The election of Marxist candidate [[Salvador Allende]] as [[President of Chile]] in September 1970 spurred a vigorous campaign of covert opposition to him by Nixon and Kissinger.[192]: 25  This began by trying to convince the Chilean congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the election, and then messages to military officers in support of a coup.[192] Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents.
It was even alleged that "Nixon personally authorized" $700,000 in covert funds to print anti-Allende messages in a prominent Chilean newspaper.[192]: 93  Following an extended period of social, political, and economic unrest, General [[Augusto Pinochet]] assumed power in a violent [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] on September 11, 1973; among the [[Death of Salvador Allende]].[193]
The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972, and met with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]; [[Alexei Kosygin]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]]; and [[Nikolai Podgorny]], the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], among other leading Soviet officials.[194]
Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev.[194] Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: [[SALT I]], the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,[147] and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles.
A banquet was held that evening at the [[Kremlin]].[194]
Nixon and Kissinger planned to link arms control to détente and to the resolution of other urgent problems through what Nixon called "[[Linkage (policy)]]".
In 1973, Nixon encouraged the [[Export–Import Bank of the United States]] to finance in part a trade deal with the Soviet Union in which [[Armand Hammer]]'s [[Occidental Petroleum]] would export [[Phosphate]] from Florida to the Soviet Union, and import Soviet [[Ammonia]].
The deal, valued at $20 billion over 20 years, involved the construction of two major Soviet port facilities at [[Odessa]] and [[Ventspils]],[198][199][200] and a pipeline connecting four ammonia plants in the greater [[Volga]] region to the port at Odessa.[200] In 1973, Nixon announced his administration was committed to seeking [[Most favored nation]] trade status with the USSR,[201] which was challenged by Congress in the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]].[202]
During the previous two years, Nixon had made considerable progress in U.S.–Soviet relations, and he embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974.[203] He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] that evening.[203] Nixon and Brezhnev met in [[Yalta]], where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and [[MIRV]].
As part of the [[Nixon Doctrine]], the U.S. avoided giving direct combat assistance to its allies and instead assisted them to defend themselves.
The president believed that—except during the [[Suez Crisis]]—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table.
On October 6, 1973, an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, supported with arms and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]].
More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338]], Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory.
When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to [[DEFCON]]3,[205] placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war.
Because Israel's victory was largely due to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., resulting in the [[1973 oil crisis]].[207] The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, but was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.[208]
Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restart [[List of Middle East peace proposals]]; he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20:
Nixon was fond of Pakistani president [[Yahya Khan]] and, according to American journalist [[Gary J.
During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the United States stood by Pakistan against Bengali nationalists in terms of diplomacy and military threats.[212] Nixon urged President Khan multiple times to exercise restraint,[213] fearing an Indian invasion of Pakistan that would lead to Indian domination of [[Indian subcontinent]] and strengthen the position of the Soviet Union.[214] In the wake of the [[Third India–Pakistan War]], Nixon issued a statement blaming Pakistan for starting the conflict and blaming India for escalating it while personally favoring a ceasefire.[215] The United States used the threat of an aid cut-off to force Pakistan to back down, while its continued military aid to Islamabad prevented India from launching incursions deeper into the country.
Nixon denied getting involved in the situation, saying that it was an internal matter of Pakistan, but when Pakistan's defeat seemed certain, he sent the aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]].[216]
The [[Great Society]] had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits.
As part of his "[[New Federalism]]" philosophy, he proposed greater local autonomy in the allocation of domestic spending through grants to the states.
However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.[218] In 1970, Congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls throughout his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.[219] With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at [[Camp David]].
Nixon's options were to limit fiscal and monetary expansionist policies that reduced unemployment or end the dollar's fixed exchange rate; Nixon's dilemma has been cited as an example of the [[Impossible trinity]] in international economics.[220][221] He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.[222] Bowles points out,
Nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.[222] Nixon's decision to end the gold standard in the United States led to the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]].
The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.[223] The controls produced [[Economic shortage]], as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss.[223] Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.[223]
Nixon advocated a "[[New Federalism]]", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them.[224] He eliminated the Cabinet-level [[United States Post Office Department]], which in 1971 became the government-run [[United States Postal Service]].[225]
Nixon was a late supporter of the [[Conservation movement]].
Nixon broke new ground by discussing environmental policy in his [[State of the Union speech]] in 1970.
He saw that the first [[Earth Day]] in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).[226] He relied on his domestic advisor [[John Ehrlichman]], who favored protection of natural resources, to keep him "out of trouble on environmental issues."[227] Other initiatives supported by Nixon included the [[Clean Air Act of 1970]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] required [[Environmental impact statement]] for many Federal projects.[227][226] Nixon vetoed the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive.
After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon [[Impoundment of appropriated funds]] the funds he deemed unjustifiable.[228]
In 1971, Nixon proposed health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate,[b] federalization of [[Medicaid]] for poor families with dependent minor children,[229] and support for [[Health maintenance organization]] (HMOs).[230] A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973.[230] In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate[b] and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and [[Cost sharing]].[231]
He called for a [[War on drugs]] and pledged to cut off sources of supply abroad.
As one policy initiative, Nixon called for more money for [[Sickle-cell disease]] research, treatment, and education in February 1971[233] and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972.[234][235][c] While Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as sickle-cell disease and for a [[War on cancer]], at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the [[National Institutes of Health]].[236]
The Nixon presidency witnessed the first large-scale [[Racial integration]] of public schools in the South.[237] Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites.[238] Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then.
Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to [[School integration in the United States]] local schools.
Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary [[George Shultz]].
By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the [[Desegregation busing in the United States]] of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance.
Some scholars, such as James Morton Turner and John Isenberg, believe that Nixon, who had advocated for civil rights in his 1960 campaign, slowed down [[Desegregation in the United States]] as president, appealing to the racial conservatism of Southern whites, who were angered by the [[Civil rights movement]].
In addition to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the [[Philadelphia Plan]] in 1970—the first significant federal [[Affirmative action]] program.[242] He also endorsed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification.[243] He also pushed for African American civil rights and economic equity through a concept known as black capitalism.[244] Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election.
After a [[Apollo program]], the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight of [[Apollo 11]].
Nixon spoke with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] during their moonwalk.
Nixon was unwilling to keep funding for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon.
Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense.[247] Nixon also canceled the Air Force [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] program in 1969, because uncrewed [[Spy satellite]] were a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.[248] NASA cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to place [[Skylab]] in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the [[Space Shuttle]].[249]
On May 24, 1972, Nixon approved a five-year cooperative program between NASA and the [[Soviet space program]], culminating in the 1975 [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] linking in space.[250]
Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of [[Political realignment]].
The Democratic "[[Solid South]]" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions.
Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] but had alienated more moderate Southerners.
Through his first term, he pursued a [[Southern Strategy]] with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the [[Civil rights movement]].
He nominated two Southern conservatives, [[Clement Haynsworth]] and [[G.
Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection.[252] Virtually assured the Republican nomination,[253] the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be [[Massachusetts]] senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (brother of [[John F.
Kennedy]]), who was largely removed from contention after the July 1969 [[Chappaquiddick incident]].[254] Instead, [[Maine]] senator [[Edmund Muskie]] became the front runner, with [[South Dakota]] senator [[George McGovern]] in a close second place.[252]
On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.[255] The following month, Nixon was renominated at the [[1972 Republican National Convention]].
He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[256] McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[257] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as [[Abortion rights]].
McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, [[Missouri]] senator [[Thomas Eagleton]], dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] for [[Major depressive disorder]].[258][259] Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972, in [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin]].
The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into the Democratic Party headquarters at the [[Watergate complex]] in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972.
[[The Washington Post]] picked up on the story; reporters [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]] relied on an informant known as "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)]]"—later revealed to be [[W.
Mark Felt]], associate director at the [[FBI]]—to link the men to the Nixon administration.
A series of revelations made it clear that the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]], and later the White House, were involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats.
Senior aides such as [[White House Counsel]] [[John Dean]] faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.[147][261][262]
In July 1973, White House aide [[Alexander Butterfield]] testified [[Perjury]] to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system and recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office.
[[Nixon White House tapes]] were [[Subpoena]] by Watergate Special Counsel [[Archibald Cox]]; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing [[Executive privilege]].
With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; he was replaced by [[Leon Jaworski]].
In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that a tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972, had an 18+1⁄2 minute gap.[262] [[Rose Mary Woods]], the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked.
Believing his first choice, [[John Connally]], would not be confirmed by Congress,[265] Nixon chose [[Gerald Ford]], [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives]], to replace Agnew.[266] One researcher suggests Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after Ford was sworn in as vice president on December 6, 1973.[267]
On November 17, 1973, during a televised question-and-answer session[268] with 400 [[Associated Press]] [[Managing editor]], Nixon said, "People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.
The [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] opened [[Federal impeachment in the United States]] hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks.
In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as [[Watergate tapes#"Smoking Gun" tape]] on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had had a lapse of memory.[272] Senate Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]], Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], and House Minority Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] met with Nixon soon after.
On August 8, 1974, facing a loss of political support and it being increasingly certain that he would be impeached and removed from office, Nixon [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech]], announcing that he would resign the presidency the following day, on August 9.[264] His resignation speech was delivered from the [[Oval Office]] and was carried live on radio and television.
Nixon said he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].
Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]], especially in foreign policy.[274] In defending his presidency, Nixon quoted "[[Citizenship in a Republic]]", a 1910 speech by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]:
Nixon's speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators, with only [[Roger Mudd]] of [[CBS News]] criticizing it for failing to admit wrongdoing.[276] [[Conrad Black]], a Nixon biographer, labeled the resignation speech "a masterpiece", saying, "What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president, Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue.
Following his resignation, the Nixons flew to their home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California]].[278] According to his biographer, [[Jonathan Aitken]], "Nixon was a soul in torment" after his resignation.[279] Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000.
With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7:00 a.m. with little to do.[279] His former press secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], sat with him alone for hours each day.[280]
In October 1974, Nixon fell ill with [[Phlebitis]].
Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides—Dean, Haldeman, and [[John Ehrlichman]]—and The Washington Post, disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the "wrong foot".
Judge [[John Sirica]] excused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections.[283] Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers—beginning a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate.[284] Nixon was in the hospital when the [[1974 United States elections]] were held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 49 seats in the House and four in the Senate.[285]
He maintained an office in a [[United States Coast Guard]] station 300 yards (270 m) from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs.[287] He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly.[288] He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler.[289] In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer [[David Frost]], who paid him $600,000 (equivalent to $3.5 million in 2024) for [[Nixon interviews]], filmed and aired in 1977.[290] They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate.
The interviews helped improve Nixon's financial position—at one point in early 1975, he had had only $500 in the bank—as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy friends of Nixon, such as [[Charles Rebozo]].[293] In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao.
Ford won, but was defeated by [[Georgia (U.S. state)]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976 United States presidential election]].
The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to withhold its official invitation.[295]
In 1976, Nixon was [[Disbarment]] by a New York State court for [[Obstruction of justice]] in the Watergate affair.[296] He chose not to present any defense.[297] In early 1978, he visited the United Kingdom; there, he was shunned by American diplomats, most ministers of the [[James Callaghan]] government, and two former prime ministers, [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]].
He was welcomed, however, by the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and former prime ministers [[Alec Douglas-Home]] and Sir [[Harold Wilson]].
Nixon addressed the [[Oxford Union]] regarding Watergate:
Farrell]] deemed it one of the better presidential memoirs, candid and capturing its author's voice; he deemed its rise up the bestseller lists justified.[300] Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier [[Deng Xiaoping]].
On August 10, 1979, the Nixons purchased a 12‐room condominium occupying the seventh floor of 817 [[Fifth Avenue]] New York City[302] after being rejected by two Manhattan [[Housing cooperative]].[303] When the deposed [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] died in Egypt in July 1980, Nixon defied the State Department, which intended to send no U.S. representative, by attending the funeral.
Though Nixon had no official credentials, as a former president, he was seen as the American presence at its former ally's funeral.[304] Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in [[1980 U.S. presidential election]], making television appearances portraying himself as, in biographer Stephen Ambrose's words, "the senior statesman above the fray".[305] He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan's victory.[306] After 18 months in the New York City townhouse, Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to [[Saddle River, New Jersey]], New Jersey.[278][307]
He joined former presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]].[278] On a trip to the Middle East, Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya, which attracted significant U.S. media attention; The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon's "rehabilitation".[308] Nixon visited the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].[278] Following this trip, Nixon was ranked in [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] as one of the ten most admired men in the world.[309]
In 1986, Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers, impressing his audience with his tour d'horizon of the world.[310] At the time, [[Pundit]] [[Elizabeth Drew]] wrote, "Even when he was wrong, Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory, as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority, enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times."[310] Newsweek ran a story on "Nixon's comeback" with the headline "He's back".[311]
On July 19, 1990, the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in [[Yorba Linda, California]] opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance.
Bush]], as well as their wives, [[Betty Ford]], [[Nancy Reagan]], and [[Barbara Bush]].[312] In January 1994, the former president founded the Nixon Center (today the [[Center for the National Interest]]), a Washington policy [[Think tank]] and conference center.[313][314]
Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993, of [[Emphysema]] and [[Lung cancer]].
Nixon suffered a severe [[Stroke]] on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his home at [[Park Ridge, New Jersey]], New Jersey.[316] A [[Thrombus]] resulting from the [[Atrial fibrillation]] he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, [[Embolus]], and traveled to his brain.[317] He was taken to [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]], initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg.[316] Damage to the brain caused swelling ([[Cerebral edema]]) and Nixon slipped into a deep coma.
Nixon's funeral took place on April 27, 1994, in [[Yorba Linda, California]].
Eulogists at the Nixon Library ceremony included President [[Bill Clinton]], former secretary of state [[Henry Kissinger]], Senate Minority Leader [[Bob Dole]], California governor [[Pete Wilson]], and the Reverend [[Billy Graham]].
In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full [[State funeral]], though his body did [[Lie in repose]] in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service.[319] Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects.[320] At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an estimated 42,000 people waiting.[321]
Stacks of [[Time (magazine)]] magazine said of Nixon shortly after his death,
[[Tom Wicker]] of The New York Times noted that Nixon had been equalled only by [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and, quoting Nixon's 1962 farewell speech, wrote,
[[The Dallas Morning News]] stated, "History ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives."[325] This offended some; columnist [[Russell Baker]] complained of "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution".[326] Cartoonist [[Jeff Koterba]] of the [[Omaha World-Herald]] depicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly.
Thompson]] wrote a scathing piece denouncing Nixon for [[Rolling Stone]], entitled "He Was a Crook" (which also appeared a month later in [[The Atlantic]]).[328] In his article, Thompson described Nixon as "a political monster straight out of [[Grendel]] and a very dangerous enemy".[328]
Historian and political scientist [[James MacGregor Burns]] asked of Nixon, "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?"[329] Evaluations [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] have proven complex, contrasting his presidency's domestic and foreign policy successes with the acrimonious circumstances of his departure.[329] According to Ambrose, "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished.
What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation."[330] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests, "He was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible [[Anti-communism]] course against the excess of McCarthy."[331] Aitken feels that "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues.
Yet even in a spirit of [[Historical revisionism]], no simple verdict is possible."[332]
Nixon saw his policies on Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union as central to his place in history.[204] Nixon's onetime opponent [[George McGovern]] commented in 1983, "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II ...
With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history."[333] Political scientist [[Jussi Hanhimäki]] disagrees, saying that Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the [[Cold War]] policy of [[Containment]] by diplomatic, rather than military, means.[204] Historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)]] concludes that "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena.
In a 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, historian Paul Charles Milazzo points to Nixon's creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and to his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]], stating that "though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure".[335] Nixon himself did not consider the environmental advances he made in office an important part of his legacy; some historians contend that his choices were driven more by political expediency than any strong [[Environmentalism]].[227] Some historians say Nixon's [[Southern Strategy]] turned the [[Southern United States]] into a Republican stronghold, while others deem economic factors more important in the change.[251] Throughout his career, Nixon moved his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a Congressman, he was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism.[336]
Olson]] has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.[337] During the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]] in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's.[338] For a time, there was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate.
Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] restored the president's power.[337]
He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects, wearing a coat and tie even when home alone.[345] Nixon biographer [[Conrad Black]] described him as being "driven" though also "uneasy with himself in some ways".[346] According to Black, Nixon
thought that he was doomed to be traduced, double-crossed, unjustly harassed, misunderstood, underappreciated, and subjected to the trials of [[Job (biblical figure)]], but that by the application of his mighty will, tenacity, and diligence, he would ultimately prevail.[347]
According to [[Ray Price (speechwriter)]], Nixon sometimes took them in together.
Nixon also took [[Dilantin]], recommended by [[Jack Dreyfus]].
His periodic overindulgences, especially during stressful times such as during [[Apollo 13]], concerned Price and others, including then-advisor Ehrlichman and long-time [[Valet]] [[Manolo Sanchez (Nixon staff member)]].[348] Author [[David Owen#Selected publications]] deemed Nixon an [[Alcoholic]].[349][350]
Biographer [[Elizabeth Drew]] summarized Nixon as a "smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents".[351] In his account of the Nixon presidency, author [[Richard Reeves (American writer)]] described Nixon as "a strange man of uncomfortable shyness, who functioned best alone with his thoughts".[352] Nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality, Reeves argues:
Even [[Bebe Rebozo]], by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name.
