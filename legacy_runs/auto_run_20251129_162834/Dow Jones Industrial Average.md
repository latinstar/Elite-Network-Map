The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Dow Jones, or simply the Dow (/ˈdaʊ/), is a [[Stock market index]] of 30 prominent companies listed on [[Stock exchange]] in the United States.
It is [[Price-weighted index]], unlike other common indices such as the [[Nasdaq Composite]] or [[S&P 500]], which use [[Capitalization-weighted index]].[4][5] The primary pitfall of this approach is that a stock's price—not the size of the company—determines its relative importance in the index.
For example, as of March 2025, [[Goldman Sachs]] represented the largest component of the index with a market capitalization of ~$167B.
In contrast, [[Apple Inc.]]'s market capitalization was ~$3.3T at the time, but it fell outside the top 10 components in the index.[6]
However, some investors believe it could be less volatile when the market is rapidly rising or falling due to its components being  [[Blue chip (stock market)]].[7]
The factor is changed whenever a constituent company undergoes a [[Stock split]] so that the value of the index is unaffected by the stock split.
First calculated on May 26, 1896,[2] the index is the second-oldest among U.S. market indices, after the [[Dow Jones Transportation Average]].
It was created by [[Charles Dow]], co-founder of [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Dow Jones & Company]], and named after him and his business associate, statistician [[Edward Jones (statistician)]].
The index is maintained by [[S&P Dow Jones Indices]], an entity majority-owned by [[S&P Global]].
Its components are selected by a committee that includes three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two representatives from the Wall Street Journal.[8] The ten components with the largest [[Dividend yield]] are commonly referred to as the [[Dogs of the Dow]].
[[General Electric]] had the longest presence on the index, beginning in the original index in 1896 and ending in 2018, but was dropped and re-added twice between 1898 and 1907.
Investing in the DJIA is possible via [[Index fund]] as well as via [[Derivative (finance)]] such as [[Option (finance)]] and [[Futures contract]].
[[Index fund]], including [[Mutual fund]] and [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions.
An ETF that replicates the performance of the index is issued by [[State Street Corporation]] ([[NYSE Arca]]: DIA).[36]
[[ProShares]] offers [[Leveraged ETFs]] that attempt to produce three times the daily result of either investing in ([[NYSE Arca]]: UDOW) or [[Short (finance)]] ([[NYSE Arca]]: SDOW) the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[37]
In the derivatives market, the CME Group through its subsidiaries the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME) and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT), issues Futures Contracts; the E-mini Dow ($5) Futures (YM), which track the average and trade on their exchange floors respectively.
Trading is typically carried out in an [[Open outcry]] auction, or over an electronic network such as CME's Globex platform.
The [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE) issues option contracts on the Dow through the root symbol DJX.
In 1884, [[Charles Dow]] composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer's Afternoon Letter, a daily two-page financial news bulletin which was the precursor to [[The Wall Street Journal]].
On January 2, 1886, the number of stocks represented in what is now the Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped from 14 to 12, as the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] were removed.
It reached a peak of 78.38 during the summer of 1890, but reached its all-time low of 28.48 in the summer of 1896 during the [[Panic of 1896]].
In the 1900s, the Dow halted its momentum as it worked its way through two financial crises: the [[Panic of 1901]] and the [[Panic of 1907]].
The negativity surrounding the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] did little to improve the economic climate; the index broke 100 for the first time in 1906.[45]
At the start of the 1910s, the [[Panic of 1910–1911]] stifled economic growth.
On July 30, 1914, as the average stood at a level of 71.42, a decision was made to close the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months.
Some historians believe the exchange was closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of [[World War I]].
An alternative explanation is that the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the [[Federal Reserve System]] later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the [[Gold standard]].
Reports from the time say that the day was positive.[46] Following World War I, the United States experienced another economic downturn, the [[Post–World War I recession]].
The Dow experienced a long bull run from 1920 to late 1929 when it rose from 73 to 381 points.[48] In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the [[Roaring Twenties]].
This period downplayed the influence of the [[Depression of 1920–21]] and certain international conflicts such as the [[Polish–Soviet War]], the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the initial phase of the [[Chinese Civil War]].
After a peak of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, the bottom of the 1929 crash came just 2 months later on November 13, 1929, at 195.35 intraday, closing slightly higher at 198.69.[49] The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] over the next several years saw the Dow continue to fall until July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22,[50] roughly two-thirds of its mid-1880s starting point and almost 90% below its peak.
Marked by global instability and the Great Depression, the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war, leading to the catastrophic [[World War II]] in 1939.
Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936–1939 [[Spanish Civil War]], the 1935–1936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], the [[Soviet-Japanese Border War (1939)]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937.
The United States experienced the [[Recession of 1937–1938]], which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt.
The [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]] in the index happened in the depths of the 1930s bear market on March 15, 1933, when the Dow gained 15.34% to close at 62.10.
The strength in the Dow occurred despite the [[Recession of 1949]] and various global conflicts.
During the 1950s, the [[Korean War]] and the [[Cold War]] did not stop the Dow's climb higher.
The Dow began to stall during the 1960s as the markets trudged through the [[Kennedy Slide of 1962]], but still managed an 18% gain from 679.36 to 800.36.
The [[1970s energy crisis]] was a prelude to a disastrous economic climate along with [[Stagflation]], the combination of high unemployment and high inflation.
However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed at 1,003.16, above the 1,000 mark for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market.[45] Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the [[1973–1974 stock market crash]], closing at 577.60 on December 6, 1974.[52] The nadir came after prices dropped more than 45% over two years since the NYSE's high point of 1,003.16 on November 4, 1972.
Although the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards [[Iran]] surrounding the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979.
The 1980s began with the [[Early 1980s recession]].
After closing above 2,000 in January 1987,[45] the [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]] occurred on [[Black Monday (1987)]], October 19, 1987, when the average fell 22.61%.
On October 13, 1989, the [[Friday the 13th mini-crash]], which initiated the collapse of the [[Junk bond]] market, resulted in a loss of almost 7% of the index in a single day.[53]
During the 1980s, the Dow increased 228% from 838.74 to 2,753.20; despite the market crashes, [[Silver Thursday]], an [[Early 1980s recession]], the [[1980s oil glut]], the [[Japanese asset price bubble]], and other political distractions.
The 1990s brought on rapid advances in technology along with the introduction of the [[Dot-com company]].
The markets contended with the [[1990 oil price shock]] compounded with the effects of the [[Early 1990s recession]] and a brief European situation surrounding [[Black Wednesday]].[citation needed] Certain influential foreign conflicts such as the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] which took place as part of the initial stages of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Revolutions of 1989]]; the [[First Chechen War]] and the [[Second Chechen War]], the [[Gulf War]], and the [[Yugoslav Wars]] failed to dampen economic enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing [[Information Age]] and the "[[Irrational exuberance]]" (a phrase coined by [[Alan Greenspan]][54]) of the [[Dot-com bubble]].[citation needed] Between late 1992 and early 1993, the Dow staggered through the 3,000 level making only modest gains as the [[Biotechnology]] sector suffered through the downfall of the Biotech Bubble; as many biotech companies saw their share prices rapidly rise to record levels and then subsequently fall to new all-time lows.[55]
The Dow soared from 2,753 to 8,000 between January 1990 to July 1997.[45] In October 1997, the events surrounding the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] plunged the Dow into a 554-point loss to a close of 7,161.15; a retrenchment of 7.18% in what became known as the [[October 27, 1997 mini-crash]].
However, the Dow continued climbing past 9,000 despite negativity surrounding the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] along with the subsequent fallout from the 1998 collapse of [[Long-Term Capital Management]] due to bad bets placed on the movement of the [[Russian ruble]].[56]
The Dow averaged a 5.3% return compounded annually for the 20th century, a record [[Warren Buffett]] called "a wonderful century"; when he calculated that to achieve that return again, the index would need to close at about 2,000,000 by December 2099.[58]
On September 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, the Dow fell 7.1%.
In 2002, the Dow dropped to a four-year low of 7,286 on September 24, 2002, due to the [[Stock market downturn of 2002]] and lingering effects of the [[Dot-com bubble]].
The Dow continued climbing and reached a record high of 14,198.10 on October 11, 2007, a mark which was not matched until March 2013.[60] It then dropped over the next year due to the [[2008 financial crisis]].
On September 15, 2008, a wider [[Financial crisis]] became evident after the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which had reached almost $150 per [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] two months earlier.
The Dow lost more than 500 points for the day, returning to its mid-July lows below 11,000.[61][62] A series of [[Bailout]] packages, including the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], proposed and implemented by the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]] did not prevent further losses.
Towards the latter half of 2009, the average rallied towards the 10,000 level amid optimism that the [[Great Recession]], the [[United States housing bubble]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]], were easing and possibly coming to an end.
During the first half of the 2010s decade, aided by the [[Federal Reserve]]'s loose [[Monetary policy]] including [[Quantitative easing]], the Dow made a notable rally attempt.
This was despite significant volatility due to growing global concerns such as the [[European debt crisis]], the [[Dubai World]] 2009 debt standstill, and the [[2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis]].[citation needed]
This event, which became known as the [[2010 Flash Crash]], sparked new regulations to prevent future incidents.[65]
Six years after its previous high in 2007, the Dow finally closed at a new record high on March 5, 2013.[66] It continued rising for the next several years past 17,000 points until a brief [[2015–16 stock market selloff]] in the second half of 2015.[67] It then picked up again in early 2016 and climbed past 25,000 points on January 4, 2018.[68]
On November 9, 2016, the day after [[Donald Trump]]'s victory over [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]], the index soared, coming within roughly 25 points of its all-time intraday high to that point.[69]
Despite the emerging [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Dow continued its bull run from the previous decade before peaking at 29,551.42 on February 12, 2020 (29,568.57 intraday on the same day).
The index slowly retreated for the remainder of the week and into the next week, before coronavirus fears and an [[2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war]] sent the index into a [[2020 stock market crash]], recording several days of losses[75] (and gains[76]) of at least 1,000 points, a typical symptom of a bear market[77] as previously seen in October 2008 during the [[2008 financial crisis]].
Volatility rose high enough to trigger multiple 15-minute [[Trading curb]].[78] In the first quarter of 2020, the DJIA fell 23%, its worst quarter since 1987.[79] The market recovered in the third quarter, returning to 28,837.52 on October 12, 2020, and peaked momentarily at a new all-time high of 29,675.25 on November 9, 2020, at 14:00 ET, following that day's announcement of the success of the [[Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine]] in Phase III clinical trials.[80] The Dow (as reported by the United Press International) closed over 30,000 on December 31, 2020, at a record 30,606.48.
On November 24, following news that the [[Presidential transition of Joe Biden]] was approved, the Dow increased by more than 500 points, closing at 30,046.24.
The DJIA is computed as the sum of the prices of all thirty stocks divided by a [[Divisor]], the Dow Divisor.
Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; this initially made the DJIA a simple [[Arithmetic]] average.
Events such as [[Stock split]] or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices.
Despite its unusual weighting by price rather than market capitalization, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is highly correlated with other proxies of the US equities market, particularly the [[S&P 500]].[7] Between  (1980-January-{{{day}}}) (2023-November-{{{day}}})January 1980 – November 2023, the DJIA returned an annualized 8.90%, with the S&P 500 returning a nearly identical 8.91%.[83]
With the inclusion of only 30 stocks, critics such as [[Ric Edelman]] argue that the DJIA is an inaccurate representation of overall market performance compared to more comprehensive indices such as the S&P 500 Index or the [[Russell 3000 Index]].
Additionally, the DJIA is criticized for being a [[Price-weighted index]], which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components.
For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger [[Percentage]] change.
For example, during September–October 2008, former component [[AIG]]'s reverse split-adjusted stock price collapsed from $22.76 on September 8 to $1.35 on October 27; contributing to a roughly 3,000-point drop in the index.[84]
Alternately, Cisco Systems and Coca-Cola are among the lowest-priced stocks in the average and have the least sway in the price movement.[85] Critics of the DJIA and most securities professionals[who?] recommend the [[Capitalization-weighted index]] S&P 500 Index or the [[Wilshire 5000]], the latter of which includes most publicly listed U.S. stocks, as better indicators of the U.S. stock market.
