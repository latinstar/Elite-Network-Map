Proto-Albanian is the ancestral [[Linguistic reconstruction]] language of [[Albanian language]], before the [[Gheg Albanian]]–[[Tosk Albanian]] dialectal diversification (before c.
600 CE).[2] [[Albanoid]] and other [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] had their formative core in the [[Balkans]] after the [[Indo-European migrations]] in the region.[3][4] Whether descendants or sister languages of what was called [[Illyrian language]] by classical sources, Albanian and [[Messapic language]], on the basis of shared features and innovations, are grouped together in a [[Albanoid]] in the current phylogenetic classification of the [[Indo-European languages]] language family.[5] The precursor of Albanian can be considered a completely formed independent IE language since at least the first millennium BCE, with the beginning of the early Proto-Albanian phase.[1]
Proto-Albanian is reconstructed by way of the [[Comparative method]] between the [[Tosk Albanian]] and [[Gheg Albanian]] dialects and between Albanian and other Indo-European languages, as well as through [[Contact linguistics]] studying early [[Loanword]] from and into Albanian and [[Language structure]] and [[Phonology]] convergences with other languages.
Loanwords into Albanian treated through its phonetic evolution can be traced back as early as the first contacts with [[Doric Greek]] (West Greek) since the 7th century BCE, but the most important of which are those from Latin (dated by De Vaan to the period 167 BCE to 400 CE) and from [[Slavic languages]] (dated from 600 CE onward).[6] The evidence from loanwords allows linguists to construct in great detail the shape of native words at the points of major influxes of loans from well-attested languages.[7]
Proto-Albanian proper is dated to the period of contacts with Latin, starting from the 2nd century BCE after the [[Roman Republic]] conquest of the Western Balkans, but the major Latin influence occurred since the first years of the common era when the Western Balkans were eventually incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]].
Common Albanian or its two dialects, Proto-Gheg and Proto-Tosk, experienced the earliest contacts with South Slavic languages since the [[Slavic migrations to the Balkans]] in the 6th–7th centuries CE.
The rise of Tosk from Proto-Albanian was prompted before Slavic contacts circa 600 CE, as evidenced by the fact that Latin and [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords are treated like native words with regard to taxonomical differences between Gheg and Tosk, but the same is not true of Slavic loans.[8][9][10][11]

[[Albanoid]] and other [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] had their formative core in the [[Balkans]] after the [[Indo-European migrations]] in the region about 3000 to 2500 BCE.[4][3] They replaced the [[Pre-Indo-European languages]], which left traces of the Mediterranean-Balkan substratum.[12][13] Shortly after they had diverged from one another, Pre-Albanian, Pre-Greek, and Pre-Armenian underwent a longer period of contact, as shown by common correspondences that are irregular for other IE languages.
The precursor of Albanian can be considered a completely formed independent IE language since at least the first millennium BCE, with the beginning of the early Proto-Albanian phase.[1] The precursor of Albanian is often thought to have been an [[Illyrian languages]] for obvious geographic and historical reasons as well as for some linguistic evidence,[15] or otherwise an unmentioned Balkan Indo-European language that was closely related to Illyrian and [[Messapic language]].[16] Messapic, which is grouped in the [[Albanoid]] of Albanian, developed in southeast Italy after crossing the Adriatic Sea at least since the Early Iron Age, being attested in about six hundred inscriptions from Iron Age [[Apulia]].[17]
In classical antiquity Proto-Albanian was spoken in the central-western part of the Balkan Peninsula, to the north and west of the [[Ancient Greeks]], as shown by early [[Doric Greek]] (West Greek) and [[Ancient Macedonian language]] loanwords that were treated with characteristic Albanian features, by classical [[Place names]] exclusively observing Albanian accent and phonetic rules, as well as by several Proto-Albanian items preserved in ancient glossaries.[18]
Proto-Albanian speech came into contact in its earlier stage with Ancient Greek since the 7th century BCE, when the [[Greek colonisation]] were founded on the Adriatic coast of Albania.
In that period early loanwords were borrowed from [[Doric Greek]] (West Greek), either directly from the colonists or indirectly through trade communication in the hinterland.[19] During the 5th–4th centuries BCE Proto-Albanian directly loaned words from [[Ancient Macedonian language]], at a time when this language [[Rise of Macedon]] in the region and was not yet replaced by [[Koine Greek]].[20] Several Proto-Albanian terms have been preserved in the lexicon of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] and other ancient glossaries.[21] Some of the Proto-Albanian glosses in Hesychius are considered to have been loaned to the Dorik Greek as early as the 7th century BCE.[22]
Evidence of a significant level of early [[Linguistic contact]] between Albanian and Greek is provided by ancient common [[Language structure]] innovations and [[Phonology]] convergence such as:[23][24]
Those innovations are limited only to the Albanian and Greek languages and are not shared with other languages of the [[Balkan sprachbund]].[23] Since they precede the Balkan sprachbund era, those innovations date to a prehistoric phase of the Albanian language, spoken at that time in the same area as Greek and within a social frame of bilingualism among early Albanians having to be able to speak some form of Greek.[24]
Proto-Albanian came into contact with [[Latin]] since the [[Illyro-Roman Wars]] in the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE, when the [[Roman Republic]] defeated the [[Illyrians]] and began to establish its rule in the Western Balkans, gradually consolidating its dominion during the last two centuries BCE.
But the major Latin influence in Proto-Albanian occurred since the first years of the common era, when the Western Balkans were eventually incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] after the Great Illyrian Revolt of 6–9 CE ([[Bellum Batonianum]]).[29]
Many Latin-based words in Albanian have the character of indirect Latinisms, as they go back to originally Latin borrowings via Ancient and Medieval Greek.[30] The name Albanian came from the [[Albanoi]], an Illyrian tribe located in north-central Albania and their city [[Albanopolis]], which was located somewhere between the [[Mat (Adriatic Sea)]] and [[Shkumbin]] rivers.[31] The Albanoi might have been mentioned first as [[Abroi]], which may have been a constituent northern tribe of the larger group of the [[Taulantii]]; modern scholars place them near the Mat and [[Drin river]] rivers.[32][33] According to Eric P.
Ancient toponyms such as Lissus, Drivastum, Candavia, Drinus, Barbanna, Mathis, Isamnus, and Ardaxanos reached their current forms as [[Lezhe]], [[Drisht]], Kunavja, Drin, [[Buna (Adriatic Sea)]], Mat, [[Ishëm (river)]], and [[Erzen]] respectively, through Albanian sound changes, indicating Albanian has been in the area since antiquity.[35][36]
Even the basic [[Christianity]] terms are of Latin origin, and since they entered Proto-Albanian before the Gheg–Tosk dialectal diversification, the Proto-Albanian speakers were [[Christianized]] under the Latin sphere of influence, specifically in the 4th century CE.[37]
[[Historical linguistic]] considerations indicate that the Roman province of [[Moesia]], and more specifically the ancient region of [[Dardani]] and adjacent zones, constitute the best candidate for the area where Proto-Albanian received its major Latin influence, and where intensive contacts between Proto-Albanian and [[Proto-Romance]] occurred,[38] eventually producing the shared innovations between Tosk Albanian and [[Proto-Romanian language]].[39][note 1] Those innovations ultimately prompted the rise of Tosk from Proto-Albanian, a diversification that began not later than the 6th–7th centuries CE (i.e. before the period of contacts with Slavic).[41] Gheg Albanian was already separated from the Albanian–(Proto-)Romanian contact zone at an earlier period.[39] Toponymy provides evidence that Albanian was already spoken since late antiquity in northern and central Albania, but not yet in southern Albania (south of the [[Shkumbin]] river).[42] Those considerations indicate that unlike Gheg, the Tosk dialect could not yet have already occupied its historical geographic distribution in late antiquity.[26] On the other hand, the multi-layered Albanian dialects in western North Macedonia provide evidence that the area was inhabited by Albanian-speakers since antiquity.[43] The historical geographic spread of the Albanian dialects as it appeared in medieval times is considered to have been shaped by the [[Slavic migrations to the Balkans]] from the 6th–7th centuries CE.[44]
During the centuries of the [[Migration Period]] in the Roman Empire after the 3rd century CE, the Imperial structures progressively weakened and eventually collapsed.
Proto-Albanian and Proto-Romanian speakers remained in close contact for a substantial time frame as mountain [[Pastoralism]].
Nevertheless, the extensive influence of the Albanian language on the pastoral vocabulary and its influence, albeit lower, on the [[Crop cultivation]] vocabulary, in Eastern Romance languages, indicate that Proto-Albanian speakers were already leading a pastoral lifestyle at the time when Latin speakers assumed the same way of life, borrowing from (Proto-)Albanian a number of technical terms.[46]
The post-Roman contact zone between Albanian and Common Romanian is considered to have been located in [[Dardania (Roman province)]] and adjacent areas.[49][note 2] From this contact the Tosk Albanian dialect is considered to have received the first impetus of developments that were shared with Eastern Romance and that did not affect the Gheg Albanian dialect as it had already separated in earlier times.[53] After a period of common innovations, but before the rise of the [[Rhotacism]] n > r (which preceded contacts with Slavic from c.
600 CE), speakers of Eastern Romance varieties that were not yet affected by this fundamental sound change separated from the Tosk Albanian–Common Romanian contact zone.[48] In a period that followed the rise of those innovations, Tosk Albanian is considered to have moved – driven by the offensive of the Slavs – to Albania south of the [[Shkumbin]] river in its historically documented location.[47]
Between the early 7th century and the late 9th century the interior areas of the Balkans were deprived of church administration, and Christianity might have survived only as a popular tradition on a reduced degree.[55] The reorganization of the Church as a cult institution in the region took a considerable amount of time,[56] as the Balkans were brought back into the Christian orbit only after the recovery of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and through the activity of Byzantine missionaries.[55]
The earliest ascertained church vocabulary of [[Middle Greek]] origin in Albanian dates to the 8th–9th centuries, at the time of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], which was started by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]].[57] In 726 Leo III established [[De jure]] the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] over the Balkans, as the Church and the State established an institution.
In particular an important role was played by the [[Theme of Dyrrhachium]] and the [[Archdiocese of Ohrid]].[58] The lack of [[Old Church Slavonic]] terms in Albanian Christian terminology shows that the missionary activities during the [[Christianization of the Slavs]] did not involve Albanian-speakers, indeed, the Christian belief among Albanians had survived through the centuries and already become an important cultural element in their ethnic identity.[59]
When the [[Slavic migrations to the Balkans]] to the Balkans and settled the plains from the 6th–7th centuries CE, they encountered Albanian-speaking Indo-Europeans and assimilated part of them,[60] but the language of the Albanians who had taken refuge in the mountainous areas of present-day northern and central [[Albania]], eastern [[Montenegro]], western [[North Macedonia]], and [[Kosovo]], managed to survive the Great Migrations.[44][45] Leading a [[Pastoralism]] lifestyle and although separated from Slavic-speakers, Albanian-speakers were not isolated, and contacts between Albanian and Slavic occurred thereafter.[61] In particular, Tosk Albanian came into contact with [[Eastern South Slavic]] dialects, and Gheg Albanian with [[Western South Slavic]] dialects.[62] Early long-standing contacts between Slavic-speakers and Albanian-speakers might have been common in mountain passages and agriculture or fishing areas, such as the valleys of the [[White Drin]] and [[Black Drin]] branches of the [[Drin river]] and around the [[Lake Shkodër]] and [[Ohrid]] lakes.
The earliest phase of contacts is dated to the 6th–8th century CE, reflecting some of the more archaic phonetic features of Slavic as well as early Albanian phonology.[63] The early Slavic loanwords into Albanian developed Slavic *s as /ʃ/ and *y as /u/ within Albanian phonology of that era.[64] Such toponyms include [[Bushtricë]] ([[Kukës]]),[65] [[Dishnica]] ([[Përmet District]]),[66] Dragoshtunjë ([[Elbasan]]),[67] Leshnjë ([[Leshnjë]], [[Berat]] and other areas),[68] [[Shushicë, Elbasan]] (Elbasan), [[Shishtavec]] (Kukës/Gora), [[Progër]] ([[Devoll Municipality]]) and [[Picar]] ([[Gjirokastër County]]),[69] Shopël ([[Iballë]]),[70] [[Veleshnjë]] ([[Skrapar]])[71] and others.[72][note 3] Part of the toponyms of early Slavic origin were acquired in Albanian before undergoing the changes of the [[Slavic liquid metathesis]] (before c.
They include [[Ardenica Monastery]] (Lushnjë), Berzanë (Lezhë), Gërdec and Berzi (Tiranë) and a cluster of toponyms along the route Berat-Tepelenë-Përmet.[74]
The evolution of the ancient toponym Lychnidus into Oh(ë)r(id) ([[Ohrid]] and [[Lake Ohrid]]), which is attested in this form from 879 CE, required an early long-standing period of Tosk Albanian–East South Slavic bilingualism, or at least contact, resulting from the Tosk Albanian [[Rhotacism]] -n- into -r- and Eastern South Slavic [[L-vocalization]] ly- into o-.[28] The name of the region [[Labëria]] resulted through the Slavic liquid metathesis: South Slavic *Labanьja < Late Common Slavic *Olbanьja 'Albania', and was reborrowed in that form into Albanian, in the period when [[Rhotacism]] was still active in Tosk Albanian.[75]
[[Vladimir Orel]] is one of the main modern international linguists to have dealt with the passage from [[Proto-Indo-European]] to Proto-Albanian to Modern Albanian.
According to Orel, the study of Proto-Albanian [[Syntax]] remains in its infancy so there are some limitations to the work.
However, there have been developments in the understanding of the historical development of [[Phonetics]] and [[Vocabulary]].[76]
Other major work has been done by [[Eqrem Çabej]] and [[Shaban Demiraj]] as well as by major scholars in the field of Romanian historical linguistics as it relates to Albanian (see [[Albanian–Romanian linguistic relationship]]) as well as other Balkan linguists.
[[Vladimir Orel]] distinguishes the following periods of Proto-Albanian: 1) "Early Proto-Albanian" (EPA): spoken before the 1st century CE, when Albanian had not yet acquired extensive influence via [[Language contact]] from [[Latin]]/[[Proto-Romance]].
2) "Late Proto-Albanian" (LPA): after extensive Latin contact, with the end of the period seeing contacts between ancient Slavic idioms still close to the [[Proto-Slavic language]], in the 6th and 7th centuries CE.
In an Albanian chapter penned by [[Michiel de Vaan]] within Klein, Joseph and Fritz' 2018 Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics,[6] Demiraj's periods are adhered to.
At present, this page follows Orel's paradigm for periods of Proto-Albanian, and presents the relationship between the synchronic phonologies of both "EPA" and "LPA" with diachronic relationships to each other and to ancestral [[Indo-European languages]] forms as well as descendant Albanian forms.
The following nasal consonant was then lost in certain morphological contexts, while the vowel remained nasalized, resulting in the emergence of LPA phonemes denoted *â, *ê, *î, and *û.[87] Except in certain Gheg varieties, *ê merged into *â.[87] The traditional view presented by Orel[87] and Desnickaja[88] is that distinctive nasalization was lost by Tosk but retained by Gheg and that this is a taxonomical difference between the two.[87] However this has now been challenged,[88] after Sheper and Gjinari discovered Lab dialects (Lab is a subdialect of Tosk) in the Kurvelesh region that still had distinctive nasal vowels,[88] and Totoni likewise found that the Lab speech of [[Borsh]] also still has nasal vowel phonemes.[89] This means that, instead of the traditional view, it is possible that denasalization happened in most Tosk dialects only after the split from Gheg.[88]
Indo-European languages are traditionally divided into [[Centum and satem languages]] based on the development of the three series of [[Dorsal consonant]] (often called "[[Guttural]]") stops, viz.
In the "centum" languages (e.g. [[Italic languages]], [[Germanic languages]], [[Greek language]]) the palatal series has merged with velar series, while the labiovelar series remained distinct; whereas in the "satem" languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages]], [[Balto-Slavic languages]]), the labiovelars merged with the plain velars, while the palatals shifted to [[Sibilant]] consonants.[103]
The (partial) retention of the Proto-IE three-way contrast for dorsal stops is an archaic feature that links Albanian with the wider [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] and is shared with Messapic[109] and Armenian.[110]
Most [[Latin]] ([[Classical Latin]], [[Late Latin]], [[Vulgar Latin]]) verbs belonging to the first declension (infinite -āre) were adapted into stems ending with PA *-ānj- (first person singular *-ānja > Old Gheg -onj > modern Albanian -oj) and, in rarer cases (usually verbal roots ending in liquids, hence -lāre and -rāre), with PA *-enj- (> modern -ej-).
Most [[Proto-Slavic language]] verbs ending in *-iti /i:ti:/ in the infinite were adapted into stems ending with PA *-itj- (first person singular *-itja > modern -is; the consonant /t/ was probably weakened to /s/ and the final /a/ was unstressed and thus lost).
Contemporary Albanian has a vocative case -o for both masculine and feminine names:[116]this vocative was borrowed from [[South Slavic languages]] ([[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Macedonian language]], [[Bulgarian language]]) since, in [[Proto-Slavic language]], the feminine vocative became *-o, which is an innovation from PIE *-éh₂.
The closest language to Albanian is [[Messapic language]], with which it forms a common branch titled Illyric in Hyllested & Joseph (2022).[119] Hyllested & Joseph (2022) in agreement with recent bibliography identify Greco-Phrygian as the IE branch closest to the Albanian-Messapic one.
Since they are limited only to Albanian and Greek, they can be traced back with certainty only to their last common Indo-European ancestor, and not projected back into [[Proto-Indo-European]].[121] A remarkable Greek/Albanian isogloss is a very ancient form for "hand": *mər-, cf.
A common [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] root *aiğ(i)- ("goat") can be reflected in Albanian edh ("goat, kid") < PAlb *aidza and dhi ("nanny goat) < PAlb *aidzijɑ̄ with Greek αἴξ ("goat", gen.
It has been noted that the Balkan IE root and all the alleged Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian roots with a meaning "goat" are likely to be not Proto-Indo-European, as they may all originate as independent and relatively early, post-PIE borrowings, from the substrate languages spoken by the [[Agrarian society]] who were encountered by immigrating Indo-European [[Pastoralism]].
The view of a substrate borrowing can be corroborated by areal words for "goat" in other IE languages, such as [[Gothic language]] gaits ("goat") and [[Latin]] haedus ("kid"), reflecting *gʰaid̯(-o)-, considered as a substrate word usually linked with [[Semitic languages]] (cf.
[[Akkadian language]] gadû, [[Aramaic language]] gaδiā ̄"kid").
Furthermore, intense Greek–Albanian contacts certainly have occurred thereafter.[14][124] An example of secondary derivations from Palaeo-Balkan linguistic contacts is the [[Thracian language]] word σπίνος spínos 'a kind of stone, which blazes when water touches it' (i.e. 'lime'), attested in [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]], with cognate Greek τίτανος ([[Attic Greek]]) and κίττανος ([[Doric Greek]]) 'gypsum, chalk, lime', stemming [[Proto-Indo-European language]] *k̑witn̥Hos 'white, whitish': although from the same PIE root, Albanian shpâ(ni) 'lime, tartar' and Greek σπίνος 'lime' derive from a secondary origin as they were probably borrowed from Thracian due to phonetic reasons.
In older literature, Orel (2000) argues that Albanian has a large number of [[Isoglosses]] that are common to Albanian, [[Germanic languages]], [[Baltic languages]] and [[Slavic languages]], as part of a "North Eastern" lexical grouping, with a large number of these referring to [[Wood]] or objects made out of wood.[127] Orel (1998) noted 24 isoglosses between Balto-Slavic and Albanian, 48 common words between Baltic and Albanian and 24 between Albanian and Slavic.
Orel identifies only one Albanian/[[Italic languages]]/[[Celtic languages]] isogloss, blertë ("green"), cognate to [[Latin]] flōrus ("bright") and [[Irish language]] blár ("gray").[129] Specifically Celtic/Albanian vocabulary was previously thought to be limited although including at least one core vocabulary item (hënë "moon", cognate to Welsh cann "white" and Breton cann "full moon"),[130] but recent work by Trumper in 2018 has proposed a larger though still not overwhelming set, with the notable addition of dritë ("light").[131]
Although knowledge of [[Tocharian languages]] is fragmentary, the one known Albanian/Tocharian isogloss is "very important" as noted by Orel: kush ("who", cognate to Tocharian A kus, with the same meaning).[132]
