The Parliament of Albania ([[Albanian language]]: Kuvendi i Shqipërisë) or Kuvendi is the [[Unicameralism]] [[Representative democracy]] of the citizens of the [[Republic of Albania]]; it is Albania's [[Legislature]].
The Parliament is composed of no less than 140 members [[Legislative elections in Albania]] to a four-year term on the basis of direct, universal, periodic and equal [[Suffrage]] by [[Secret ballot]].[1][2][3] The Parliament is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Albania]], who is assisted by at least one deputy speaker.
The electoral system is based on [[Party-list proportional representation]].
There are 12 multi-seat [[Constituency]], corresponding to the country's [[Counties of Albania]].
The Parliament's powers are defined by the [[Constitution of Albania]].
Among its responsibilities, it has the power to amend the borders of Albania or the Constitution, pass all laws, approve the [[Cabinet of Albania]], supervise the work of the government, declare war, decide on cessation of hostilities, adopt the state's budgets and approve the state's accounts.
Other duties include calling [[Referendum]], performing elections and appointments conforming to the Constitution and applicable legislation, supervising operations of the government and other civil services responding to Parliament, granting amnesty for criminal offences and performing other duties defined by the Constitution.
The Parliament also [[Legislative elections in Albania]] the [[President of Albania]].
When the Parliament is elected, the first session shall be held no later than 20 days after the completion of elections with the [[President of Albania]] as the speaker.[4] However, all laws passed by the Parliament are published on [[Fletorja Zyrtare]], which is the [[Official journal]] of the [[Government of Albania]].[5]
The oldest Assembly with extant records was held in [[Lezhë]] on 2 March 1444.
The [[League of Lezhë]] (Kuvendi i Lezhës) forged in [[Lezhë]] under [[Gjergj Kastrioti]] as the leader against the [[Ottoman Empire]].[6]
The word Kuvend, in definite form kuvendi, is a very old word in the [[Albanian language]] that is thought to have originated from the [[Latin]] word conventus, meaning gathering of people or [[Popular assembly]].[7] Its use dates back to the fifteenth century when men, mainly from northern Albania, gathered to listen to the debate between [[Lekë Dukagjini]] and [[Skanderbeg]] on what would be allowed and what was not.[8] These laws would then be codified into [[Oral law]] inherited from generation to generation, especially in the northern areas of Albania, from Dukagjini itself to what is called Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit or simply [[Kanun (Albania)]].
In the nineteenth century with the [[Transcription (linguistics)]] of these laws by Father [[Shtjefën Gjeçovi]], for the first time the institutional meaning of the word is given in written form where in Chapter 148, Article 1106 of the Kanun it is said:
Kuvendi is a union of kin or several [[Albanian tribes]] with the chief, the fore-elder, the elder, the young, or the little ones, who intend to resolve any issue or to bind the [[Besa (Albanian culture)]].[9]
On 28 November 1912, the most influential and prominent figures of Albania gathered in the so-called [[All-Albanian Congress]] held in [[Vlorë]], where Kuvendi i Vlorës (the [[Assembly of Vlora]]) was constituted and which as the first decision declared unanimously the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].[10][11] Kuvend was later reused to name the country's legislative institution after the communists took power in 1946, refusing to use words borrowed from foreign languages and previously used by other regimes or governments.[8] Today, words such as Asambleja (the Assembly), Parlamenti (the Parliament), or the word Kuvendi itself are part of the Albanian dictionary which is published periodically by the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]], and have been used, and continue to be widely used interchangeably to indicate the same thing, by serving more as a [[Synonym]] for each other than as a translation.
The [[League of Lezhë]] was a military and diplomatic alliance of the [[Albanian nobility]], created in the city of [[Lezhë]] on 2 March 1444.
The League of Lezhë is considered as the first unified independent [[Albania in the Middle Ages]], with [[Skanderbeg]] as leader of the regional Albanian chieftains and nobles united against the [[Ottoman Empire]].[12] Skanderbeg was proclaimed "Chief of the League of the Albanian people" while Skanderbeg always signed himself as "Dominus Albaniae" ([[Albanian language]]: Zot i Arbërisë, [[English language]]: Lord of Albania).[13][14]
At the assembly of Lezha, members from the families: [[Kastrioti family]], [[Arianiti]], [[Zaharia family]], [[Muzaka]], [[Spani family]], [[Thopia family]] and members of the [[Balšić noble family]] and [[Crnojević noble family]] which were linked matrilineally or via marriage to the Kastrioti were present.
Soon after its creation the pro-Venetian Balšići and Crnojevići left the league in the events that led to the [[Albanian–Venetian War]] (1447-48).
In 1914, with the drafting of the Organic Statute of Albania by the [[International Control Commission (Albania)]], the establishment of Asambleja Kombëtare (the National Assembly) as a legislative body was foreseen.
This assembly would consist of a total of 36 members elected by the people, members appointed by the monarch [[Wilhelm, Prince of Albania]], as well as [[Ex officio member]].
The beginning of the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]] made impossible the establishment of the institution.[17]
After the end of the First World War, between 25 and 27 of December 1918, the [[Congress of Durrës]] decided on the formation of a [[Government of Durrës]], as well as the establishment of the Pleqësia (the "Council of Elders"), which was essentially a [[Senate]].[18] This Senate would meet once every two months and the government would have to consult with it on major issues related to the fate of the state.[19] However, due to internal divisions the Senate never convened, becoming one of the reasons for the dismissal of the [[Government of Durrës]] in January 1920.[20]
After the dismissal of the Government of Durrës, among others, the [[Congress of Lushnja]] established the Senate as the first Albanian [[Legislature]] body, which would later be named Këshilli Kombëtar (National Council).
In this period, the principles of [[Parliamentary system]] are affirmed for the first time: the appointment and dismissal of the Government by the Council, as well as the exercise of parliamentary control over it.[21]
The National Council met for the first time on 27 March 1920 in newly established capital, [[Tirana]], while the first session was opened by [[Mytesim Këlliçi]] until through vote [[Xhemal Naipi]] was elected, becoming the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Albania]].[22] Although the first Albanian legislature extended its activity in a short period of time, it managed to pass some important laws.
This law established the electoral system which was by [[Indirect election]] with two rounds.
In the first round, based on the administrative division according to the [[Districts of Albania]], every 500 men would elect a delegate, who consequently in the second round will elect a total of 75 members of the National Council, thus making one member elected by about 12,000 eligible voters.[23] Although with many problems, this law paved the way for the creation of the first two Albanian parties which were: Partia Popullore (the Popular Party) led by [[Fan Noli]], and Partia Përparimtare (the Progressive Party) led by [[Kadri Prishtina]] and [[Shefqet Verlaci]].[23] The legislative activity of the National Council ended on 20 December 1920, when the Council was dissolved to give way to the [[1921 Albanian parliamentary election]] in Albania on 21 April 1921.[24]
During the period of the [[Albanian Republic]], the country had a [[Bicameralism]] legislature, consisting of a [[Senate]] ([[Albanian language]]: Senati) and a [[Chamber of Deputies]].[25] From 1928 to 1939, during the era of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)]], Albania's legislature was known simply as the Parliament (Albanian: Parlamenti).[25]
During the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] and the existence of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)]], Albania's legislature was known as the Supreme Fascist Cooperative ([[Albanian language]]: Korporativi i Epërm Fashist).[25] From 1943 to 1944, during [[Nazi Germany]] occupation of Albania and the formation of [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)]], Albania's legislature was known as the National Assembly (Albanian: Kuvendi Kombëtar).[25] From 1944 to late 1945, a National Anti-fascist Liberation Council (Albanian: Këshilli Antifashist Nacional Çlirimtar) was formed by politicians opposing the [[Nazism]] puppet government.
Later during multiple periods of regime changes, Albania's legislature was known as the [[Constituent assembly]] ([[Albanian language]]: Asambleja Kushtetuese or Kuvendi Kushtetues).
This occurred in 1924, prior to the formation of the [[Albanian Republic]], in 1928, prior to the formation of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)]], and from 1946 to 1947, prior during the era [[Democratic Government of Albania]] and prior to the formation of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]].[25]
From 1947 to 1991, during the era of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], Albania's legislature was known as the People's Assembly (Albanian: Kuvendi Popullor).[25] Since 1997, the parliament has been known simply as the Parliament of the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Kuvendi i Republikës së Shqipërisë).[25][a] Currently the President is elected by the parliament.
The current members were chosen in the [[2025 Albanian parliamentary election]].
The Parliament's powers are defined by the [[Constitution of Albania]].
The Parliament [[Representative democracy]] the citizens of the [[Albania]], it acts as the country's [[Legislature]].
It convenes regularly in two sessions each year, the first session on the third Monday of January and the second session on the first Monday of September.[30] However, extraordinary sessions may be called by the [[President of Albania]], the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] or by one-fifth of the parliamentary members.[31] Further the sessions are open to the public.[32] The parliament decides through a [[Majority]] votes, in the presence of more than half of its members, except for cases where the constitution provides for a qualified majority.
However, certain decisions are made by [[Supermajority]] majority votes.[33]
The parliament elect the [[President of Albania]] by [[Secret ballot]] and without debate by three-fifths of the parliamentary members.
The president addresses messages to the Parliament and sets the date of [[Politics of Albania#Elections]], for the organs of local power and for the conduct of referendums.
Due to that, it has the right to deploy [[Albanian Armed Forces]] outside its borders.[34]
The [[Constitution of Albania]] mandates that the Parliament consists of at least 140 members, elected by a [[Secret ballot]], of which 100 members are elected [[Direct election]].[1] The [[Term of office]] is four years, but [[Elections in Albania]] can be held earlier in the relatively rare case that the Parliament is dissolved prematurely by the [[President of Albania]].[35] The Parliament can be dissolved by the President on the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Parliament, if the recommendation is made and accepted before the Parliament acts to elect a new Prime Minister.[36] Elections for the Parliament are held 30 to 60 days before the end of the mandate, and at most 45 days after its dissolution.
The electoral system is [[Closed list]] proportional representation.
There are 12 multi-member [[Constituency]], corresponding to the 12 [[Counties of Albania]] of the country.
Seats are allocated using the [[D'Hondt method]] with a 2.5% [[Electoral threshold]].
The two largest political parties in [[Albania]] are the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] (PS) and the [[Democratic Party of Albania]] (PD).
The last [[Elections]] were held on 11 May 2025.
Parliamentary [[Committee]] investigate specific matters of policy or government administration or performance that cannot be directly handled by the Parliament due to their volume.
The committees provide an opportunity for organisations and individuals to participate in [[Policy]] making and to have their views placed on the public record and considered as part of the decision-making process.
