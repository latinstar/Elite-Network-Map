The 2008 financial crisis, also known as the global financial crisis (GFC) or the Panic of 2008, was a major worldwide [[Financial crisis]] centered in the United States.
The causes included excessive [[Speculation]] on property values by both homeowners and [[Financial institution]], leading to the [[2000s United States housing bubble]].
This was exacerbated by [[Predatory lending]] for [[Subprime mortgages]] and by deficiencies in [[Regulation]].
[[Cash out refinancing]] had fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined.
The first phase of the crisis was the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]], which began in early 2007, as [[Mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) tied to U.S. [[Real estate]], and a vast web of [[Derivative (finance)]] linked to those MBS, collapsed in value.
A [[Liquidity crisis]] spread to global institutions by mid-2007 and climaxed with the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008, which triggered a [[Stock market crash]] and [[Bank run]] in several countries.[1] The crisis exacerbated the [[Great Recession]], a [[Global recession]] that began in mid-2007, as well as the [[United States bear market of 2007–2009]].
It was also a contributor to the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis]] and the [[Euro area crisis]].
During the 1990s, the [[U.S. Congress]] had passed legislation that intended to expand [[Affordable housing in the United States]] through looser financing rules, and in 1999, parts of the [[1933 Banking Act]] (Glass–Steagall Act) were [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], enabling institutions to mix low-risk operations, such as [[Commercial bank]] and [[Insurance#Insurance companies]], with higher-risk operations such as [[Investment banking]] and [[Proprietary trading]].[2] As the [[Federal Reserve]] ("Fed") lowered the [[Federal funds rate]] from 2000 to 2003, institutions increasingly targeted low-income homebuyers, largely belonging to [[Racial minorities]], with high-risk loans;[3] this development went unattended by regulators.[4] As interest rates rose from 2004 to 2006, the cost of [[Mortgage]] rose and the demand for housing fell; in early 2007, as more U.S. subprime mortgage holders began [[Default (finance)]] on their repayments, lenders went bankrupt, culminating in the bankruptcy of [[New Century Financial]] in April.
As demand and prices continued to fall, the [[Financial contagion]] spread to global [[Credit markets]] by August 2007, and [[Central bank]] began injecting [[Liquidity]].
In March 2008, [[Bear Stearns]], the fifth-largest U.S. investment bank, was sold to [[JPMorgan Chase]] in a "[[Fire sale]]" backed by Fed financing.
In response to the growing crisis, governments around the world deployed massive [[Bailout]] of financial institutions and used [[Monetary policy]] and [[Fiscal policies]] to prevent an [[Economic collapse]] of the [[Global financial system]].[5] By July 2008, [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], companies which together owned or guaranteed half of the U.S. housing market, verged on collapse; the [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]] enabled the federal government to seize them on September 7.
[[Lehman Brothers]] (the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank) filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on September 15, which was followed by a Fed bail-out of [[American International Group]] (the country's largest insurer) the next day, and the seizure of [[Washington Mutual]] in the largest bank failure in U.S. history on September 25.
On October 3, Congress passed the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]], authorizing the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] to purchase [[Toxic assets]] and bank stocks through the $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP).
The Fed began a program of [[Quantitative easing]] by buying treasury bonds and other assets, such as MBS, and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], signed in February 2009 by newly elected President [[Barack Obama]], included a range of measures intended to preserve existing jobs and create new ones.
These initiatives combined, coupled with actions taken in other countries, ended the worst of the [[Great Recession]] by mid-2009.
The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] fell by 53% between October 2007 and March 2009, and some estimates suggest that one in four households lost 75% or more of their [[Net worth]].
In 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was passed, overhauling financial regulations.[6] It was opposed by many [[Republican Party (United States)]], and it was weakened by the [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act]] in 2018.
The [[Basel III]] capital and liquidity standards were also adopted by countries around the world.[7][8]
The crisis exacerbated the [[Great Recession]], a [[Global recession]] that began in mid-2007.[10][11][12][13][14] It was also followed by the [[Euro area crisis]], which began with the start of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] in late 2009, and the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis]], which involved the [[Bank failure]] of all three of the major banks in Iceland and, relative to the size of its economy, was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history.[15] It was among the five worst financial crises the world had experienced and led to a loss of more than $2 trillion from the global economy.[16][17] U.S. home mortgage debt relative to [[GDP]] increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 (~$15 trillion in 2024) trillion.[18] The increase in [[Cash out refinancing]], as home values rose, fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined.[19][20][21] Many financial institutions owned investments whose value was based on home mortgages such as [[Mortgage-backed securities]], or [[Credit derivative]] used to insure them against failure, which declined in value significantly.[22][23][24] The [[International Monetary Fund]] estimated that large U.S. and European banks lost more than $1 trillion on [[Toxic asset]] and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009.[25]
Lack of investor confidence in bank [[Solvency]] and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and [[Commodity]] prices in late 2008 and early 2009.[26] The crisis rapidly spread into a global economic shock, resulting in several [[Bank failure]].[27] Economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined.[28] Housing markets suffered and unemployment soared, resulting in [[Eviction]] and [[Foreclosure]].
Derivatives such as [[Credit default swap]] also increased the linkage between large financial institutions.
The [[De-leveraging]] of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade.
Reductions in the growth rates of [[Developing countries]] were due to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and [[Remittance]] sent from migrant workers (example: Armenia[38]).
As part of [[National fiscal policy response to the Great Recession]], governments and central banks, including the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Bank of England]], provided then-unprecedented trillions of dollars in [[Bailout]] and [[Stimulus (economics)]], including expansive [[Fiscal policy]] and [[Monetary policy]] to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity, avoid a further collapse, encourage lending, restore faith in the integral [[Commercial paper]] markets, avoid the risk of a [[Deflationary spiral]], and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals.[40] In effect, the central banks went from being the "[[Lender of last resort]]" to the "lender of only resort" for a significant portion of the economy.
Following a model initiated by the [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package]],[46][47] the governments of European nations and the United States guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued [[Preferred stock]] in major banks.[32] The [[Federal Reserve]] created then-significant amounts of new currency as a method to combat the [[Liquidity trap]].[48]
Bailouts came in the form of trillions of dollars of loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and direct spending.[49] Significant controversy accompanied the bailouts, such as in the case of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]], leading to the development of a variety of "decision making frameworks", to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis.[50] [[Alistair Darling]], the U.K.'s [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time of the crisis, stated in 2018 that Britain came within hours of "a breakdown of law and order" the day that [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] was bailed-out.[51] Instead of financing more domestic loans, some banks instead spent some of the stimulus money in more profitable areas such as investing in emerging markets and foreign currencies.[52]
In July 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was enacted in the United States to "promote the financial stability of the United States".[53] The [[Basel III]] capital and liquidity standards were adopted worldwide.[54] Since the 2008 financial crisis, consumer regulators in America have more closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages in order to deter anticompetitive practices that led to the crisis.[55]
At least two major reports on the causes of the crisis were produced by the U.S. Congress: the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] report, released January 2011, and a report by the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] entitled Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse, released April 2011.
In total, 47 bankers served jail time as a result of the crisis, over half of whom were from Iceland, where the crisis was the most severe and led to the collapse of all three major Icelandic banks.[56] In April 2012, [[Geir Haarde]] of Iceland became the only politician to be convicted as a result of the crisis.[57][58] Only one banker in the United States served jail time as a result of the crisis, [[Kareem Serageldin]], a banker at [[Credit Suisse]] who was sentenced to 30 months in jail and returned $24.6 million in compensation for manipulating bond prices to hide $1 billion of losses.[59][56] No individuals in the United Kingdom were convicted as a result of the crisis.[60][61] In [[SEC v.
Goldman Sachs ABACUS]], [[Goldman Sachs]] paid a $550 million civil penalty and acknowledged that its marketing materials for CDO contained incomplete information, settling [[Securities fraud]] charges after allegedly anticipating the financial crisis and selling toxic investments to its clients.[62][63][64]
With fewer resources to risk in [[Creative destruction]], the number of patent applications was flat, compared to exponential increases in patent application in prior years.[65]
Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the [[Great Depression]].
Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable [[Economic growth]] in a context of price stability.[190]
The expansion of central bank lending in response to the crisis was not confined to the [[Federal Reserve]]'s provision of aid to individual financial institutions.
The Federal Reserve has also conducted several innovative lending programs to improve liquidity and strengthen different financial institutions and markets, such as [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]].
Also, the [[Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility]] (TALF) was put in place thanks to a joint effort with the US Department of the Treasury.
Also, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] said that it would briefly cover the assets of the fund.
The [[FDIC]] also did several things, such as raising the insurance cap from $100,000 to $250,000, to boost customer trust.
They engaged in [[Quantitative easing]], which added more than $4 trillion to the financial system and got banks to start lending again, both to each other and to people.
A package of policies was passed that let borrowers refinance their loans even though the value of their homes was less than what they still owed on their [[Mortgage]].[223]
While the causes of the bubble and subsequent crash are disputed, the precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 was the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]] and the subsequent [[Subprime mortgage crisis]], which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of [[Mortgage loan]], particularly [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]].
The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in [[Subprime lending]].
In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[Government-sponsored enterprise]] (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003.
A contrarian view is that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] led the way to relaxed underwriting standards, starting in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing no-down-payment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as [[Bank of America Home Loans]].[266][267]
Depending on how "subprime" mortgages are defined, they remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they rose to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005–2006 peak of the [[United States housing bubble]].[268]
The majority report of the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by three of the four Republican appointees, studies by [[Federal Reserve]] economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government [[Affordable housing]] policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis.
In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, conservative [[American Enterprise Institute]] [[Fellow]] [[Peter J.
Wallison]][269] stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
On September 10, 2003, the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] held a hearing, at the urging of the administration, to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities.[271][272] The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation.[273] Some, such as Wallison, believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the U.S. financial system that went unheeded.[274]
A 2000 [[United States Department of the Treasury]] study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid-level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period.
In an article in Portfolio magazine, [[Michael Lewis]] spoke with one trader who noted that "There weren't enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product." Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using [[Derivative (finance)]] called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and [[Synthetic CDO]].
Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis.
Sanders reported (in December 2010): "We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in [[CMBS]] [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis."[291] Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate.
By contrast, this ratio increased to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006.[295] This [[Housing bubble]] resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out [[Second mortgage]] secured by the price appreciation.
In a [[Peabody Award]]-winning program, [[NPR]] correspondents argued that a "Giant Pool of Money" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade.
Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the [[Mortgage-backed security]] and the [[Collateralized debt obligation]] that were assigned safe [[Credit rating]] by the [[Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis]].[296]
In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage [[Supply chain]], from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them.
By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak.[298][299] As prices declined, borrowers with [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]] could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default.
After the bubble burst, Australian economist [[John Quiggin]] wrote: "And, unlike the Great Depression, this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets.
There was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the 1920s, the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations, or the [[Smoot-Hawley tariff]], all of which have shared the blame for the Great Depression." Instead, Quiggin lays the blame for the 2008 near-meltdown on financial markets, on political decisions to lightly regulate them, and on rating agencies which had self-interested incentives to give good ratings.[305]
From 2000 to 2003, the [[Federal Reserve]] lowered the [[Federal funds rate]] target from 6.5% to 1.0%.[306][307] This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], as well as to combat a perceived risk of [[Deflation]].[308] As early as 2002, it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed "needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble".[309] Moreover, empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis.[310]
Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by rising U.S. [[Current account (balance of payments)]] deficit, which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006.
Federal Reserve chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] explained how trade deficits required the U.S. to borrow money from abroad, in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates.[311]
The [[Balance of payments]] [[Accounting identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)]] deficit also have a [[Capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount.
[[Ben Bernanke]] referred to this as a "[[Saving glut]]".[312]
A flood of funds ([[Financial capital]] or [[Liquidity]]) reached the U.S. financial markets.
Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing [[Treasury bond]] and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis.
Financial institutions invested foreign funds in [[Mortgage-backed securities]].[citation needed]
The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006.[313] This contributed to an increase in one-year and five-year [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]] (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners.[314] This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate in housing.[315][316] U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst.[317][32]
Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as "[[Liar loans]]" because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process.[318] Testimony given to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] by [[Whistleblower]] [[Richard M.
Bowen III]], on events during his tenure as the Business Chief Underwriter for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for [[Citigroup]], where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters, suggests that by 2006 and 2007, the collapse of [[Mortgage underwriting]] standards was endemic.
His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by [[Citigroup]] from some 1,600 mortgage companies were "defective" (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)—this, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met [[Citigroup]] standards.
Moreover, during 2007, "defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to [[Citigroup]] standards) increased ...
In separate testimony to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], officers of Clayton Holdings, the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe, testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators' underwriting standards.
The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 "[[Too big to fail]]" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer.
[[Predatory lending]] refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, enticing borrowers to enter into "unsafe" or "unsound" secured loans for inappropriate purposes.[322][323][324]
In June 2008, [[Countrywide Financial]] was sued by then [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] for "unfair business practices" and "false advertising", alleging that Countrywide used "deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated, risky, and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to third-party investors".[325] In May 2009, Bank of America modified 64,000 Countrywide loans as a result.[326] When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared.
This caused Countrywide's financial condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in a decision by the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] to seize the lender.
One Countrywide employee—who would later plead guilty to two counts of [[Wire fraud]] and spent 18 months in prison—stated that, "If you had a pulse, we gave you a loan."[327]
Former employees from [[Ameriquest]], which was United States' leading wholesale lender, described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits.
There is growing evidence that such [[Mortgage fraud]] may be a cause of the crisis.[328]
U.S. households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or [[Financial leverage]] during the years preceding the crisis.[350] This increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn.[351] Key statistics include:
U.S. household debt as a percentage of annual [[Disposable personal income]] was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990.[350] In 1981, U.S. private debt was 123% of GDP; by the third quarter of 2008, it was 290%.[352]
From 2004 to 2007, the top five U.S. [[Investment banks]] each significantly increased their financial leverage, which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock.
The shift from first-loss [[Tranches]] to AAA-rated tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage.[353] These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of U.S. nominal GDP for 2007.
[[Lehman Brothers]] [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]], [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] were sold at fire-sale prices, and [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] became commercial banks, subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two U.S. [[Government-sponsored enterprise]], owned or guaranteed nearly $5 trillion (c.
$7.13 trillion in 2024[285]) trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into [[Conservatorship]] by the U.S. government in September 2008.[355][356]
Too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the [[Paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession.
Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.[351]
In April 2009, [[Federal Reserve]] vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:
The term [[Financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing.
Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[Adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[Collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[Securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS).
As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[Synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.
Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.[359] Economists have studied the crisis as an instance of [[Cascades in financial networks]], where institutions' instability destabilized other institutions and led to knock-on effects.[360][361]
[[Martin Wolf]], chief economics commentator at the [[Financial Times]], wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: "an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade—the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself—was to find a way round regulation."[362]
Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between "late 2005 to the middle of 2007"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for "high quality" CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[Mezzanine capital]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.
[[AIG]] insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of [[Credit default swap]].
The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis.
The Commission concludes [[AIG]] failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure—a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices.
Li's [[Gaussian copula]] formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees.[371]
As financial assets became more complex and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that the international [[Bond rating]] agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were.[372] [[George Soros]] commented that "The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves.
A [[Conflict of interest]] between [[Investment management]] professional and [[Institutional investor]], combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets.
Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[Assets under management]].
Despite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.[375] The volume Credit Correlation: Life After Copulas, published in 2007 by [[World Scientific]], summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations.
There is strong evidence that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the "[[Shadow banking system]]" and that competition from the [[Shadow banking system]] may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans.
In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]]—who in 2009 became [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]—placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a [[Bank run]] on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the [[Shadow banking system]].
Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[Asset–liability mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets.
Economist [[Paul Krugman]], laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis.
He referred to this lack of controls as "[[Benign neglect]]" and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity.[339] Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of [[Mortgage-backed securities]] or [[Asset-backed commercial paper]], investment banks and other entities in the [[Shadow banking]] system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations.[378][339]
This meant that nearly one-third of the U.S. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009.[379] According to the [[Brookings Institution]], at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume." The authors also indicate that some forms of [[Securitization]] were "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions".
Caballero]], [[Emmanuel Farhi]], and [[Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas]] argued that the financial crisis was attributable to "global asset scarcity, which led to large capital flows toward the United States and to the creation of asset bubbles that eventually burst".[380] Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas argued "that the sharp rise in oil prices following the subprime crisis – nearly 100 percent in just a matter of months and on the face of recessionary shocks – was the result of a speculative response to the financial crisis itself, in an attempt to rebuild asset supply.
As theorized by [[Andrew Metrick]], the demand for safe assets following the Asian Financial Crisis coupled with the lack of circulating treasuries created an unmet demand for "risk free" assets.
Some commentators and economists associated with the [[Austrian school of economics]], including former [[Ron Paul]] and historian [[Tom Woods]], have offered a [[Libertarianism in the United States]] interpretation of the crisis which differs from the explanations centered on deregulation and government oversight.
In Ron Paul's book, [[End the Fed]], Paul argues that the [[Federal Reserve]] prolonged policy of [[Federal funds rate]] in the early 2000s created a [[Credit bubble]] that allowed for speculative investments and unsustainable levels of debt, particularly in housing.[383][384][385] In Tom Woods' book [[Meltdown (Woods book)]], he also contends that Federal Reserve manipulation of the money supply and credit markets distorted normal price signals, leading to widespread malinvestment, resulting in an inevitable correction.[386][387]
Paul and Woods also criticized [[Fannie Mae]]'s and [[Freddie Mac]]'s role in the crisis, asserting that the entities engaged in excessive risk-taking by expanding homeownership beyond sustainable levels.[388][389][383] In doing this, the government intervention created [[Moral hazard]] by assuring large financial institutions that they would receive government support in times of crisis, which Paul and Woods believe encouraged riskier behavior.[386][390]
In a 1998 book, [[John McMurtry (academic)]] suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of [[Capitalism]] itself.[391]
In his 1978 book, [[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism]], [[Ravi Batra]] suggests that growing inequality of [[Financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes.
[[John Bellamy Foster]], a political economy analyst and editor of the [[Monthly Review]], believed that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing [[Market saturation]].[393]
[[Marxian economics]] followers [[Andrew Kliman]], Michael Roberts, and Guglielmo Carchedi, in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster, pointed to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[Rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally.
Echoing the central thesis of [[James Burnham]]'s 1941 seminal book, [[James Burnham#The Managerial Revolution]], Bogle cites issues, including:[395]
In his book [[The Big Mo (book)]], [[Mark Roeder]], a former executive at the Swiss-based [[UBS]] Bank, suggested that large-scale momentum, or [[The Big Mo]], "played a pivotal role" in the financial crisis.
[[Robert Reich]] attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States, particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80% of the workforce.
Economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession.[398]
A report by the [[International Labour Organization]] concluded that [[Cooperative banking]] institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis.
The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7% of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011.[399] In 2008, in the U.S., the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of [[Credit union]], and almost five times the credit union rate in 2010.[400] Credit unions increased their lending to small- and medium-sized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased.[401]
Economists, particularly followers of [[Mainstream economics]], mostly failed to predict the crisis.[402] The [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]'s online business journal examined why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis and concluded that economists used mathematical models that failed to account for the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions, as opposed to producers and consumers of goods and services, play in the economy.[403]
Several followers of [[Heterodox economics]] predicted the crisis, with varying arguments.
[[Dirk Bezemer]][404] credits 12 economists with predicting the crisis: [[Dean Baker]] (US), [[Wynne Godley]] (UK), [[Fred Harrison (author)]] (UK), [[Michael Hudson (economist)]] (US), Eric Janszen (US), [[Steve Keen]] (Australia), [[Jakob Broechner Madsen]] & Jens Kjaer Sørensen (Denmark), [[Med Jones]] (US)[405] [[Kurt Richebächer]] (US), [[Nouriel Roubini]] (US), [[Peter Schiff]] (US), and [[Robert Shiller]] (US).
Shiller, a founder of the [[Case–Shiller index]] that measures home prices, wrote an article a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in which he predicted that a slowing U.S. housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst, leading to financial collapse.[406] Peter Schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse.[407]
The [[Austrian School]] regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply.[408]
The former Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], [[Raghuram Rajan]], had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]].
In 2005, at a celebration honoring [[Alan Greenspan]], who was about to retire as chairman of the [[US Federal Reserve]], Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector.[410] In that paper, Rajan "argued that disaster might loom".[411] Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to "take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time.
Stock trader and financial risk engineer [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], author of the 2007 book The Black Swan, spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and framed the problem as part of "robustness and fragility".[412][413] He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis ("They didn't listen, so I took their money").[414] According to [[David Brooks (commentator)]] from [[The New York Times]], "Taleb not only has an explanation for what's happening, he saw it coming."[415]
For example, an article in [[The New York Times]] noted that economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.[416] According to [[The Guardian]], Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him "Dr. Doom".[417]
In a 2012 article in the journal [[Japan and the World Economy]], Andrew K.
The authors examined various economic indicators, ignoring [[Financial contagion]] across countries.
The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based [[IndyMac]], a spin-off of [[Countrywide Financial]].
Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest [[Savings and loan association]] in the Los Angeles market and the seventh-largest [[Mortgage loan]] originator in the United States.[419] The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was (until the crisis precipitated even larger failures) the fourth-largest [[Bank run]] in United States history,[420] and the second-largest failure of a regulated [[Savings and loan association]].[421] IndyMac Bank's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank.[422] IndyMac Bancorp filed for [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] in July 2008.[422]
Loeb]] and [[Angelo Mozilo]][423][424] as a means of [[Cross-collateralization]] [[Countrywide Financial]] loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale.
IndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets—states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble]] was most pronounced—and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.
As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products.
The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[Secondary mortgage market]].
On May 12, 2008, in the "Capital" section of its last 10-Q, [[IndyMac]] revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future.[429]
IndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds—including $160 million (~$228 million in 2024) issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio.
Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37% of IndyMac's total deposits, and asked the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.[430] With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,[429] Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits.
Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion (~$2.21 billion in 2024) or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.[429] This [[Bank run]] on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS.
On June 26, 2008, Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), a member of the [[Senate Banking Committee]], chairman of Congress' [[Joint Economic Committee]] and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, released several letters he had sent to regulators, in which he was"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers." Some worried depositors began to withdraw money.[433][434]
On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into [[Conservatorship]].
A [[Bridge bank (United States)]], IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts.
IndyMac Bancorp filed for [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] on July 31, 2008.[422]
Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and [[Countrywide Financial]], as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets.
Concerns that investment bank [[Bear Stearns]] would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to [[JP Morgan Chase]].
These included [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, [[Washington Mutual]], [[Wachovia]], [[Citigroup]], and [[AIG]].[32] On October 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO [[Richard S.
Fuld Jr.]] found himself before Representative [[Henry A.
Waxman]], the California Democrat who chaired the [[House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]].
