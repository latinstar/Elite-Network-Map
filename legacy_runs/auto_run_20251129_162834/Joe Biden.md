A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)]], he represented [[Delaware]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1973 to 2009 and also served as the 47th [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Barack Obama]] from 2009 to 2017.
Born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], Biden graduated from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1965 and the [[Syracuse University College of Law]] in 1968.
He was elected to the [[New Castle County Council]] in 1970 and the [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware]].

He drafted and led passage of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].
Biden also oversaw six [[U.S. Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings, including contentious [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination]] and [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination]].
He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but voted in favor of the [[Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002.
Biden ran unsuccessfully for the [[1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries]] and [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].
In 2008, Obama chose him as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama [[Vice presidency of Joe Biden]].
In the [[2020 United States presidential election]], Biden chose [[Kamala Harris]] as his running mate, and they defeated [[Republican Party (United States)]] incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]].
As president, Biden signed the [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021]] in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]] and [[COVID-19 recession]].

During the [[Gaza war]], Biden condemned the actions of [[Hamas]] as terrorism, [[United States support for Israel in the Gaza war]], and sent limited humanitarian aid to the [[Gaza Strip]].
A temporary [[January 2025 Gaza war ceasefire]] he backed was adopted shortly before his presidency ended.
[[Age and health concerns about Joe Biden]] persisted throughout his presidency.
He began his presidency with majority support, but saw his approval ratings decline significantly throughout his presidency, partially due to public frustration over [[2021-2023 inflation surge]], which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 before dropping to 2.9% by the end of his presidency.
Biden initially [[Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign]] and, after the [[2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], became the party's presumptive nominee in the [[2024 United States presidential election]].
After his performance in the [[2024 Joe Biden–Donald Trump presidential debate]], renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his age and health led him to [[Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election]].
In 2022 and 2024, Biden's administration was [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary]] by historians and scholars, diverging from [[United States presidential approval rating]] of his tenure.
He is the [[List of presidents of the United States by age#Age of presidents]], the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age]], and the oldest person to have served as president.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]],[2] to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names]] Finnegan)[3] and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[4] He is the oldest child in a [[Catholic Church]] family of mostly Irish descent.
Biden has a sister, [[Valerie Biden Owens]], and two brothers, [[James Biden]] and Francis.[5]
Joseph Sr. had been wealthy, and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of [[Garden City, New York]], in 1946.[6] After he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[7][8][9] the family lived with Jean's parents in Scranton for several years.[10] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s, and Joseph Sr. could not find steady work.[11] Beginning in 1953, when Biden was ten,[12] the family lived in an apartment in [[Claymont, Delaware]], before moving to a house in nearby [[Mayfield, Delaware]].[b] Joseph Sr. later became a successful [[Used-car salesman]], maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[10][11][15]
At [[Archmere Academy]] in Claymont,[16] Biden played baseball and was a standout [[Halfback (American football)]] and [[Wide receiver]] on the [[High school football]] team.[10][17] Though a poor student, he was [[Class president]] in his junior and senior years.[18][19] He graduated in 1961.[18] At the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware]], Biden briefly played freshman football[20][21] and received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a [[Double major]] in history and [[Political science]] in 1965.[22][23]
Biden married [[Neilia Hunter Biden]], a student at [[Syracuse University]], on August 27, 1966,[22][24] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic.
Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in [[Skaneateles, New York (village)]].[25] They had three children: [[Beau Biden]], [[Hunter Biden]], and Naomi Christina "Amy" Biden.[22]
Biden earned a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Syracuse University College of Law]] in 1968.
In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he [[Plagiarism]] a law review article, but the failing grade was later stricken.
His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85.[26] He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States]] to the [[Delaware bar]] in 1969.[1]
Biden clerked at a law firm headed by prominent local [[Republican Party (United States)]] William Prickett in 1968 and self-identified as a Republican.[27][28] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor [[Charles L.
Terry]]'s conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, [[Russell W.
Peterson]], who defeated Terry in 1968.[27] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an [[Independent politician]] because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate [[Richard Nixon]].[27]
In 1969, Biden resumed practicing law, first as a [[Public defender]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].
Most of his clients were [[African Americans]] from Wilmington's east side.[29][30] Biden then joined a firm headed by Sid Balick, a locally active Democrat.[31][27] Balick named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party,[32] and Biden switched his registration to Democratic.[27] He also started his own firm, Biden and Walsh.[31] [[Corporate law]], however, did not appeal to him, and [[Criminal law]] did not pay well.[10] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[33]
Biden ran for the fourth district seat on the [[New Castle County, Delaware#County Council]] in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34][35] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T.
Biden had not openly supported or opposed the [[Vietnam War]] until he ran for Senate and opposed [[Richard Nixon]]'s conduct of the war.[40] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student [[Conscription]] deferments.
Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had "[[Asthma]] as a teenager" was the reason.[41]
He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, was thought to have no chance of winning.[42][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[43] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[33] He received help from the [[AFL-CIO]] and Democratic pollster [[Patrick Caddell]].[42] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with "politics as usual".[42][43] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[42] but his energy, young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[43]
A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident in [[Hockessin, Delaware]], on December 18, 1972.[22][44] Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.[45] He considered resigning to care for them,[15] but [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] persuaded him not to.[46] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[47][48] He wrote that he "felt God had played a horrible trick" on him[49] and had trouble focusing on work.[50][51]
Biden met teacher [[Jill Tracy Jacobs]] in 1975 on a [[Blind date]].[52] They married at the [[Church Center for the United Nations]] in New York on June 17, 1977,[53][54] and spent their honeymoon at [[Lake Balaton]] in the [[Hungarian People's Republic]].[55][56] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[57]
In 1981, the couple had a daughter, [[Ashley Biden]],[22] who is a social worker, activist, and fashion designer.[58] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage.
Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, [[Hunter Biden laptop controversy]], and [[Weiss special counsel investigation]] came under [[United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family]] during his father's presidency.
In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his [[Weiss special counsel investigation]] on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[c] Beau became an Army [[Judge-advocate]] in Iraq and later [[Delaware attorney general]][63] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[64][65]
From 1991 to 2008, as an [[Adjunct professor]], Biden co-taught a [[Seminar]] on [[Constitutional law]] at [[Widener University School of Law]].[66][67]
Elected to the U.S. Senate in [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware]], Biden was reelected in [[1978 United States Senate election in Delaware]], [[1984 United States Senate election in Delaware]], [[1990 United States Senate election in Delaware]], [[1996 United States Senate election in Delaware]], [[2002 United States Senate election in Delaware]], and [[2008 United States Senate election in Delaware]], regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[68] Aged 30 when first elected, he was the [[List of youngest members of the United States Congress#List of youngest U.S. senators]].[69] He was junior senator to [[William Roth]] until Roth was defeated in 2000.[70] He remains one of the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service]] in U.S. history.[71] For 36 years, he commuted from Washington to Wilmington via [[Amtrak]], earning him the nickname "Amtrak Joe".[72]
During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[73] In 1974, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns, and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and [[Military conscription]].[74] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] for president in the [[1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].
Carter won the Democratic nomination and the [[1976 United States presidential election]].[75] Biden also worked on [[Arms control]].[76][77] After Congress failed to ratify the [[SALT II]] Treaty signed in 1979 by [[Soviet general secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and President Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[78] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State [[George Shultz]] at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of [[South Africa]] despite its policy of [[Apartheid]].[27] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[79][80] Biden was an advocate for Delaware military installations, including [[Dover Air Force Base]] and [[New Castle Air National Guard Base]].[81]
In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of [[Race-integration busing]].
Biden became [[Ranking minority member]] of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] in 1981.
He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act]] in 1984.
His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[85] In 1994, Biden helped pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], which included [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]],[86][87] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]],[88] which he has called his most significant legislation.[89] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[90][91] Biden later expressed regret for passing the bill.[92]
Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning [[List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people]] from serving in the armed forces.[93][94] In 1996, he voted for the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[95] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in [[Obergefell v.
Biden was critical of [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel]] [[Ken Starr]] during the 1990s [[Whitewater controversy]] and [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]] investigations, saying "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[97] He voted to acquit during the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]].[98] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers (such as [[MBNA]], one of Delaware's largest companies).[99][15] [[Bill Clinton]] vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]],[15] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[100] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased [[Amtrak]] funding and rail security.[68][101]
In February 1988, after several episodes of severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking [[Intracranial berry aneurysm]].[102][103] While recuperating, he suffered a [[Pulmonary embolism]].[103] A second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May.[103][104] His recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[105]
Biden was a longtime member of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]].
He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a [[Ranking member]] from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[106]
As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious [[Supreme Court of the United States]] confirmation hearings.[15] When [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination]] in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination.
Conservatives were angered,[107] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[107][108] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[15] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong [[Originalism]] and the view that the [[Constitution of the United States]] provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[108] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[108] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[109]
During [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination]] in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[110] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to "[[Beanball]]".[111] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that [[Anita Hill]] had accused Thomas of [[Sexual harassment]] when they had worked together.[112][113] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[15] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[114] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[15] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[114] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[115]
Biden was a longtime member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]].
He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[116] His positions were generally [[Liberal internationalism]].[76][117] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[116][117] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[118]
Biden voted against authorization for the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.[117] He became interested in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] after hearing about Serbian abuses during the [[Croatian War of Independence]] in 1991.[76] Once the [[Bosnian War]] broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the "[[Lift and strike (Bosnian War)]]" policy.[76][116] [[George H.
Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[76][117] In April 1993, Biden had a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]].[119] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[119] He has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his "proudest moment in public life" related to foreign policy.[117] In 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]], Biden supported the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].[76] He and Senator [[John McCain]] co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward [[Kosovo Albanians]].[117][120]
Biden was a strong supporter of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)]], saying, "Whatever it takes, we should do it."[121] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]] was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to "eliminate" that threat.[122] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]], approving the [[U.S. invasion of Iraq]].[117] As chair of the committee, he assembled witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization.
They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his government, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of [[Weapons of mass destruction]].[123] Biden eventually became a critic of the war, calling his vote a "mistake" by 2005,[124][125] but did not push for withdrawal.[117][119] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the [[Americans]]" about its cost and length.[116][120]
He opposed the [[Troop surge of 2007]],[117][119] saying General [[David Petraeus]] was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work.[126] Biden, through a plan developed with [[Council on Foreign Relations]] president [[Leslie H.
Gelb]], instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose [[Federalism in Iraq]].[d] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[131] but the idea failed to gain traction.[126]
Biden declared his candidacy for the [[1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries]] on June 9, 1987.[132] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination]] hearings, and his appeal to [[Baby Boomer]].[27][133][134] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[133][134]
By August, Biden's campaign messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[135] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by [[Labour Party (UK)]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]].[136] Biden had credited Kinnock on previous occasions,[137][138] but did not on two occasions in August.[139]: 230–232 [138] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a speech by [[Robert F.
Kennedy]] (for which his aides took blame) and the [[Inaugural address of John F.
Two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by [[Hubert Humphrey]].[140] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, [[Jesse Jackson]], had called him to point out that Jackson had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[15][26] A few days later, it was publicized that, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a [[Fordham Law Review]] article with inadequate citations.[26] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[141]
Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended [[Law school]] on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[142][143] and that he had marched in the [[Civil rights movement]].[144] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures,[145] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy.[146]
After exploring running in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].[68][147][148] Biden focused on the [[Iraq War]], his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[149] Biden was noted for his [[One-line joke]] during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate [[Rudy Giuliani]], "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and [[Cultural influence of the September 11 attacks]]."[150]
Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].[151] He never rose above single digits in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Democratic Party 2008 presidential candidates]].
In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008]], garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[152] He withdrew from the race that evening.[153]
Although they had served together on the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[126][155] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[154]: 28, 337–338  Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was "the real deal".[155][154]: 28, 337–338
In August 2008, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility of a place for Biden in the Obama administration,[156] and developed a strong personal rapport.[155] On August 22, Obama announced that Biden would be his [[Running mate]].[157] [[The New York Times]] reported that the choice reflected a desire for someone with [[Foreign policy]] and [[National security]] experience.[158] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and [[Blue-collar]] voters.[159][160] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]].[161]
Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee and then-[[Governor of Alaska]], [[Sarah Palin]].[162][163] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks.[164][165] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama.
As the [[2008 financial crisis]] reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which passed in the Senate.[167] On October 2, he participated in the [[2008 United States presidential debates]] with Palin at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].
Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had still won the debate overall.[168] On November 4, Obama and Biden [[2008 United States presidential election]].[169][170][171]
As Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[172] as permitted by Delaware law.[68] Having been [[2008 United States Senate election in Delaware]] to the Senate as well as the vice presidency,[173] Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[174] He [[Resignation from the United States Senate]] on January 15.[175][176]
In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the [[2012 United States presidential election]],[177] but with Obama's popularity declining, [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[William M.
Biden's May 2012 statement that he was "absolutely comfortable" with [[Same-sex marriage]] gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as "evolving".[180] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were irked, since Obama had planned to shift position in the build-up to the party convention.[166][181][182] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[181] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[183]
Following the first presidential debate of the general election, in which Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster,[188] his lead over Romney collapsed,[189] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, [[Paul Ryan]].[190][191] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[192][193] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory.[194][195] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase "a bunch of malarkey" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]] in September.[196][197] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[198] On November 6, Obama and Biden were reelected.[199]
Bush]]'s vice president, [[Dick Cheney]], and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[200] He was sworn in on January 20, 2009.[201] He was the first vice president from [[Delaware]][202] and the first [[Roman Catholic]] vice president.[203][204] Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[205] White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] said Biden helped counter [[Groupthink]].[206] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their [[Number One Observatory Circle]] in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[207]
Biden oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure investment]] intended to help counteract the [[Late-2000s recession]].[208] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had "misread how bad the economy was", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[209] When he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[210]
Biden's off-message response to a question in April 2009, during the beginning of the [[2009 flu pandemic]], led to a swift retraction by the White House.[211] The remark revived Biden's reputation for [[Political gaffe]].[212][213][214] A [[Hot mic]] picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] was "a big fucking deal" on March 23, 2010.[215] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended [[Sidwell Friends School]] together.[166]
Biden visited [[Kosovo]] in May 2009 and affirmed the U.S. position that its "independence is irreversible".[216] He lost an internal debate to Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] about [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)]],[217][218] but his skepticism was valued,[219] and his views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[213] Obama delegated Biden to oversee Iraq policy, and he became the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership before the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[e]
Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the [[United States elections, 2010]], maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[177] After big Republican gains in the elections and Emanuel's departure, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[222][223] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the [[New START treaty]].[222][223] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader [[Mitch McConnell]], were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary [[Extension of the Bush tax cuts]].[223][224] The package passed as the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]].
Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011]].[225] Biden's relationship with McConnell brought about the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] that solved the crisis.[226][227][228] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 [[U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden]],[185][229] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[230][231] In 2012, Biden made the case for Obama's reelection: "Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive."[232]
Obama named Biden to head the [[Gun Violence Task Force]], created to address the causes of [[School shooting]] and consider possible [[Gun control]] measures in the aftermath of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], in December 2012.[233] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the "[[United States fiscal cliff]]", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] being passed at the start of 2013.[234][235]
Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at [[Number One Observatory Circle]], his official residence, with Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[236] He played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]], which resolved the [[2013 United States federal government shutdown]] and the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013]].
Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] and other Democratic leaders cut him out of direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[237][238][239]
The act led to related developments, such as the [[White House Council on Women and Girls]], begun in the first term, as well as the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]], begun in January 2014 with Biden and [[Valerie Jarrett]] as co-chairs.[240][241] He talked about sexual violence while introducing [[Lady Gaga]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]] in 2016, receiving a [[Standing ovation]] from the audience.[242]
Biden favored arming [[Timber Sycamore]].[243] As the [[ISIL]] [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)]] intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[244][245] He had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[246] In August 2016, Biden visited [[Serbia]], where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister [[Aleksandar Vučić]] and expressed condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[247] Biden never [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States]], making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[248]
During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].[249] With his family, friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with [[Hillary Clinton]]'s favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to be seriously considering the prospect and a "[[Draft (politics)]] Biden 2016" [[Political action committee]] (PAC) was established.[249][250][251] During 2015, Biden was uncertain about running, particularly due to the recent death of his son Beau,[252] before ultimately announcing his decision not to run that October.[253][254][255]
Biden left office on January 20, 2017, and was succeeded by the 48th [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Mike Pence]].
After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], developing the [[Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement]].
In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, [[Promise Me, Dad]], and went on a book tour.[258] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[259]
Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the [[First presidency of Donald Trump]].[260][261][262] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[263][264] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator [[John McCain]].[265] Biden continued to support [[Cancer research]].[266]
Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[267] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying "never say never".[268] A [[Political action committee]] known as [[Time for Biden]] was formed in January 2018.[269] Biden launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[270] saying he was worried by the [[First presidency of Donald Trump]] and felt a "sense of duty".[271]
Public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates head-to-head against Trump.[272][273][274] With Democrats keenly focused on "electability" for defeating Trump,[275] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[276] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[277][278] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] to investigate [[Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory]] by Biden and his son [[Hunter Biden]].[279] No evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[280][281][282] Trump was perceived by many as attempting to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency,[283] resulting in [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]][284] and [[First impeachment of Donald Trump]].[285]
In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[286] Biden had previously called himself a "tactile politician" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[287] Journalist [[Mark Bowden]] described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he "doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you...
Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[290][291] Despite this, he finished fourth in the [[2020 Iowa caucuses]] and fifth in the [[New Hampshire presidential primary]].[292][293] He performed better in the [[Nevada presidential caucuses]], reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind [[Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign]].[294] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] by more than 28 points.[295] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates [[Pete Buttigieg]] and [[Amy Klobuchar]], he made large gains in the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries.
Biden won [[Results of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], putting him in the lead.[296] [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]] soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[297] In March 2019, Biden said, "I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else.
In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, [[Joe Biden sexual assault allegation]] Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[299] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[299][300] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[301][302]
When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's [[Presumptive nominee]].[303] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden.[304] [[Barack Obama]] endorsed Biden the next day.[305] There was a great deal of interest in who his running mate would be, in part because of "the expectation, downplayed but not exactly denied by the Biden campaign, that the 77-year-old would be a one-term president".[306] Biden said, "I view myself as a transition candidate."[306] On August 11, Biden announced [[Kamala Harris]] as his running mate, making her the first African American and first [[South Asian American]] vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[307] On August 18, at the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]], Biden officially became the Democratic Party nominee for president in the [[2020 United States presidential election]].[308][309]
Biden was [[2020 United States presidential election]] the 46th president in November 2020, defeating the incumbent, [[Donald Trump]].[310] Trump and numerous other Republicans repeatedly made [[False or misleading statements by Donald Trump]] that widespread [[Electoral fraud]] had occurred and that only he had legitimately won the election.[f] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[313] On November 23, [[General Services Administration]] [[Emily W.
Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[g] Trump nonetheless [[Criminal conspiracy]][311]: 33–53  with his [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign]] team to [[Trump fake electors plot]] (all of which Biden had won) that [[Making false statements]] to be legitimate electoral votes for President Trump and Vice President [[Mike Pence]].[h] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate]], either [[President of the Senate of the United States]] Pence or [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] [[Chuck Grassley]], would claim the unilateral power to reject [[United States Electoral College#Electors]] during the [[2021 United States Electoral College vote count]]; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states for which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election]] in Trump's favor.[i] This plan failed after Pence refused to cooperate with it.[j] Trump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6 to march to the [[United States Capitol]] while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, whereupon [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]] the building and interrupted the count.
Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[336][337] At 78, he was then the oldest person to assume the office up to that point.[k][336][339] Biden was the second [[Catholic]] U.S. president, after [[John F.
Kennedy]],[340][341] and the first president elected from the state of [[Delaware]].[342] He was also the first person since [[George H.
Bush]] to have been both vice president and president,[343] and the only president to date from the [[Silent Generation]].[344][345] Biden's inauguration was "a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]].[346]
By his third day, orders had included rejoining the [[Paris Climate Agreement]], ending the state of national emergency at the [[Mexico–United States border]], directing the government to rejoin the [[World Health Organization]], [[100 Days Masking Challenge]] on [[Federal lands]], measures to combat [[Hunger in the United States]],[l] and revoking permits for the construction of the [[Keystone XL pipeline]].[351][352][353]
On March 11, Biden signed into law the [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021]], a $1.9 trillion [[Stimulus (economics)]] and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]] and health effects of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].[354] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the [[Child tax credit (United States)]].
Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the [[Minimum wage in the United States]] to $15 per hour, but after the [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate]] determined that including the increase in a [[Budget reconciliation]] bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats removed it.[355][356][357]
Also in March, amid [[Mexico–United States border crisis]], Biden said migrant adults were "being sent back", in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[358] He earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them, leading the Biden administration in March to direct the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to help.[359]
On April 14, Biden announced that the United States [[2020–2021 U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan]] from the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)]] until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[360] In February 2020, the Trump administration had [[United States–Taliban deal]] with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[361] Biden's decision met with a range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[362] On April 22–23, Biden held an [[2021 Leaders' Climate Summit]] at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its [[Greenhouse gas emissions]] by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.[363][364] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his [[2021 Joe Biden speech to a joint session of Congress]].[365]
On June 17, Biden signed the [[Juneteenth National Independence Day Act]], which officially declared [[Juneteenth]] a [[Federal holidays in the United States]].[366] In July 2021, amid a slowing of [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United States]] and the spread of the [[SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant]], Biden said that it was "gigantically important" for Americans to be vaccinated.[367]
In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate]] to allow for the passing of the [[Freedom to Vote Act]] and [[John Lewis Voting Rights Act]].[368] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[369] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan [[Postal Service Reform Act of 2022]] to revamp the finances and operations of the [[United States Postal Service]] agency.[370] Biden supported the [[Bipartisan Safer Communities Act]] aimed to address gun reform issues following the [[Robb Elementary School shooting]] in [[Uvalde, Texas]];[371] he signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[372]
The [[Honoring our PACT Act of 2022]] was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[373] The act intended to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including [[Burn pits]], during military service.[374]
In 2022, Biden signed the [[Respect for Marriage Act]], which repealed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] and [[Interracial marriage in the United States]] marriages.[375]
In January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ratified as the "28th Amendment" to the [[Constitution of the United States]].
The declaration has no formal effect[378][379] and the [[National Archives of the United States]] has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution due to "established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions".[380]
Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the [[COVID-19 recession]] and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid [[2021–2022 inflation surge]].
Amid a surge in [[2021–2023 inflation surge]] and [[2021–present global energy crisis]], Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[395][396][397] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns.
Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the [[117th United States Congress]], including the [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021]], [[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]], [[CHIPS and Science Act]], and the [[Inflation Reduction Act]].[404] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[405] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of [[Semiconductors]], to [[China–United States relations#Economic relations]].[406] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour.
The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[407][408] His administration rigorously enforced [[United States antitrust law]].
In 2022, Biden blocked a [[2022 United States railroad labor dispute]] planned by multiple labor unions.[409] During the [[2023 United Auto Workers strike]], he expressed support for the workers.[410] Biden joined striking UAW workers' [[Picketing]] in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[411] He refused to block a [[2024 United States port strike]] from the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] in October 2024.[412]
Over the course of five days in March 2023, [[2023 banking crisis]], triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global [[Financial contagion]].
After [[Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank]], the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[413] He claimed that the [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act]] of [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] contributed to the bank's failure.[414]
At the beginning of the [[118th United States Congress]], Biden and congressional Republicans [[2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis]] after the U.S. hit its [[United States debt ceiling]], which raised the risk that the U.S. would [[Default (finance)]] on its debt.[415] Biden and House speaker [[Kevin McCarthy]] struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the [[Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023]], which suspended the debt limit until January 2025.
By the end of 2021, 40 of his nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since [[Ronald Reagan]].[423] Biden prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[424]
In January 2022, Supreme Court justice [[Stephen Breyer]] announced his intention to retire.
During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[425] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[426] On February 25, [[Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination]] federal judge [[Ketanji Brown Jackson]].[427] She was sworn in on June 30.[428] By the end of his presidency, Biden had appointed 235 judges, more appointments in a single term than any other president in at least 50 years.
63% of Biden's judges were women and 60% were non-white.[429][430] Biden expressed interest in judicial [[Term limits in the United States#Federal term limits]] and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[431]
As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the [[American Jobs Plan]], a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[432][433] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the [[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]],[434][435] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[436] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[437]
The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the [[Build Back Better Act]], a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the [[Social safety net]] and includes major provisions on climate change.[438][439] Democrats attempted to pass it on a [[Party-line vote]] through [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)]], but struggled to win the support of Senator [[Joe Manchin]], even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[440] After Manchin rejected the bill,[441] it was comprehensively reworked into the [[Inflation Reduction Act of 2022]], covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[442]
The [[Inflation Reduction Act of 2022]] was introduced by Manchin and Senator [[Chuck Schumer]].[443][444] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and [[Climate change]], $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of [[Affordable Care Act]] subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and [[Tax reform]].[445] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower [[Climate change in the United States]] between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[446] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by the vice president of the United States]].
Before and during the [[2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the [[European Union]] cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[449] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[450] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction.
The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[451] In July 2023, when [[2023 Western North America heat wave]], Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[452][453] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of [[Wetland]] and 161,000 km of waterways).[454]
Illegal border crossings at the [[Mexico–United States border]] began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[n] reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[461][462] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on [[Asylum in the United States]] claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[463][464][465] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014.[466] Biden used [[Humanitarian parole]] to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border.
In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators [[Kyrsten Sinema]] and [[James Lankford]].
He had previously supported the [[U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021]], which he proposed on his first day in office.[470][471] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed [[Department of Homeland Security]] to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[472][473] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[474] While not addressing the status of "[[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]]", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with [[H-1B visas]] to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges.[475]
Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Mike Johnson]] announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[476][477] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[478][479][480] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[481][482] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225–187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it.[483] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[484] In June 2024, Biden issued an [[A Proclamation on Securing the Border]] allowing the president to restrict the Mexico–U.S. border.[485][463]
Biden issued more individual pardons and commutations than any other president.[486] On October 6, 2022, he pardoned all Americans convicted of "small" amounts of [[Cannabis (drug)]] possession under federal law.[487] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[488][489] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in [[Home confinement]] who had previously been released from prison.[490][491] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as [[Michael Conahan]], a judge involved in the [[Kids for cash]], and [[Rita Crundwell]], a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history.
The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency "deserve a second chance" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[492][493] On December 23, 2024, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal [[Death row]] inmates.[494] On his last day in office, Biden commuted the sentence of [[Leonard Peltier]], convicted of murdering two FBI agents, to house arrest.[495]
The pardon's sweeping extent was "unprecedented".[497] According to [[Reason (magazine)]] magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than [[Richard Nixon]]'s or other "controversial"[497] pardons:
On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures.[496] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including [[James Biden]], who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden.
Others pardoned that day include former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Mark Milley]], former [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] director [[Anthony Fauci]], and members and participants in the [[House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack]], despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation.[496][486] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about "baseless and politically motivated investigations" during Trump's second term.[504][505][506] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt.[507][508] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon.[486][509]
Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of [[Tax evasion]], and [[Gerald G.
On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast [[Battle for the Soul of the Nation speech]], Biden called for a "battle for the soul of the nation".
Off camera, he called Trump supporters "semi-fascists", which Republican commentators denounced.[513][514][515] A predicted Republican [[Wave elections in the United States]] did not materialize and the race for [[U.S. Congress]] control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of [[2022 United States House of Representatives elections]],[o] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the [[2022 United States Senate elections]].[520][p]
It was the first midterm election since [[1986 United States gubernatorial elections]] in which the incumbent president's party achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since [[1934 United States elections]] in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[524] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly strong performance,[525] but they likely overperformed for other reasons, including [[Dobbs v.
He attended [[47th G7 summit]], [[2021 Brussels NATO summit]], and an EU summit, and held [[2021 Russia–United States summit]] with Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].[528]
In September 2021, Biden announced [[AUKUS]], a [[Defense pact]] between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure "peace and stability in the [[Indo-Pacific]]".[529]
In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its [[U.S. support for Saudi-led operations in Yemen]] in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's [[Houthis]] as terrorists.[530][531] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the [[Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi#Death]], the second leader of the [[Islamic State]].[532] In late July, Biden approved the [[Drone strike]] that [[Killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the second leader of [[Al-Qaeda]], and an integral member in the planning of the [[September 11 attacks]].[533] The [[OPEC#2022 oil production cut]] caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, threatening a longstanding [[Saudi Arabia–United States relations]].[534][535]
In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the [[2024 Ankara prisoner exchange]], the largest [[Prisoner exchange]] since the end of the [[Cold War]].
It involved the release of 26 people, including journalist [[Evan Gershkovich]] and former Marine [[Paul Whelan]].[536] In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a [[2024 Israel–Lebanon ceasefire agreement]] agreement in the [[Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–2024)]].[q]
American forces had begun withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a [[United States–Taliban deal]] that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[541] The Taliban began [[2021 Taliban offensive]] on May 1.[542][543] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[361] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, "The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely."[361]
On August 15, [[Fall of Kabul (2021)]] under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President [[Ashraf Ghani]] fled the country.[361][544] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[545] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[546] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[547][548][549] On August 16, Biden addressed the "messy" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation "unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated".[544][550] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be "dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves".[550][551]
On August 26, a [[2021 Kabul airport attack]] killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans.
U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[555][556] On September 25, 2024, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution condemning the Biden administration for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with ten Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor.[557]
In February 2022, the [[Russian Armed Forces]] under President [[Vladimir Putin]] launched [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]].
After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded by imposing severe [[International sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and authorizing over $8 billion in [[List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War]].[558][559][560] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[561][562] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[563][564][565] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging [[2021–present global energy crisis]] and [[2022 food crises]].[566][567][568]
In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[569] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[570] but delays in the passage of further aid by the [[United States House of Representatives]] inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[571][572][573] Actually delivered aid often differed from announced levels and was also often delayed.
The [[Government Accountability Office]] and [[Department of Defense Office of Inspector General]] found that the Biden administration seemed unaware of the pace of weapons deliveries.[574]
Throughout the conflict, Biden consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside [[Russia]].
An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of [[Kharkiv]] for "counter-fire" purposes.[r] Biden also blocked access for some weapons systems altogether, typically citing fears of escalation, only to permit deliveries for some weapons later on.[s]
The [[China–Solomon Islands relations]] caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific.
Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal.[584][585][586] In a September 2022 interview with [[60 Minutes]], Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of "an unprecedented attack" by the Chinese,[587] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of "[[Strategic ambiguity]]" toward China and Taiwan.[588][589][590] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[591] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[591][592][588] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[593]
On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a [[2023 Chinese balloon incident]] off the coast of [[South Carolina]].[594][595] The [[Chinese government]] denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian [[Airship]] that had blown off course.[596][597] Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken]] postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[598][599][600] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled [[Tariff]] on [[Solar cell]] imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on [[Lithium-ion battery]] imported from China.[601] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[601]
In April 2024, Biden signed the [[Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act]], which would ban [[Social networking service]] if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a "foreign adversary controlled application".
The act explicitly applies to [[ByteDance]] and its subsidiaries, which are based in China.
It ceases to be applicable if the application is [[Divestment]] and no longer considered to be controlled by a [[United States foreign adversaries#Other meanings]].
Biden had signed the [[No TikTok on Government Devices Act]] in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government.[602][603][604]
In October 2023, Hamas [[October 7 attacks]] that [[Gaza war]], jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations [[Israel–Saudi Arabia relations]].[605] Biden stated [[United States support for Israel in the Gaza war]] and condemned the attack by Hamas, but discouraged Israel from initiating a ground invasion of Gaza.[606][607] Upon Israel's retaliation against Hamas, Biden deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[608] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[609] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing [[2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip]].[610] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported "humanitarian pauses" to deliver aid to the [[Gaza Strip]].[611] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[612] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[613] Biden has said he is a [[Zionist]].[614][615] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel.
Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and [[Gaza humanitarian crisis (2023–present)]].[616][617][618]
Following the [[Flour massacre]] on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[619] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[620] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the [[Gaza Strip famine]].[621]
Biden continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread [[Gaza war protests in the United States]].
A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[622] Beginning in April 2024, widespread [[List of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024]], denouncing Biden.[623]
On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli [[January 2025 Gaza war ceasefire]] proposal, saying that Hamas was "no longer capable" of another large-scale attack.[624][625][626] The proposal, which was intended to establish a permanent ceasefire, bring about the release of all hostages, and lead to the reconstruction of the [[Gaza Strip]], was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by [[Egypt]] and [[Qatar]].[627][628] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding "the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[629][630][631] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[632] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[633] Biden was reported by journalist [[Bob Woodward]] to have clashed throughout the war with Netanyahu regarding his war strategy and lack of a post-war plan for Gaza.[607] In the last week of Biden's presidency, Qatari officials announced that Hamas had accepted the ceasefire deal; Biden hailed the deal.[634][635]
Following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Biden expressed support for expanding [[NATO]] to cover [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].[636][637] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[638][639] [[Finland–NATO relations]] occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by [[Turkey]] and [[Hungary]] to [[Sweden–NATO relations]] led to a stalemate.[640] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[641][642] He has also expressed openness to [[Ukraine]] entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[643] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the [[Enlargement of NATO#Membership Action Plan]] typically required for NATO entry.[644][645]
In November 2022, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a "locked closet" at the [[Penn Biden Center]].[646][647] According to the White House, the documents were reported to the [[U.S. National Archives]], which recovered them the next day.[647] On November 14, Attorney General [[Merrick Garland]] appointed [[John R.
Lausch Jr.]] to conduct an investigation.[648][649] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's [[Wilmington, Delaware]] residence.[650]
Hur]] as special counsel to investigate "possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records".[651] On January 20, after a 13-hour [[Consent search]] by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[652] FBI agents searched Biden's home in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]] on February 1 and collected papers from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[653] On February 8, 2024, Hur announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[654]
On January 11, 2023, the [[United States House of Representatives]] launched [[United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family]] into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, [[Hunter Biden]], and brother, [[James Biden]].[655] The committee's chair, Representative [[James Comer]], simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the [[Hunter Biden laptop controversy]].[656]
On September 12, House speaker [[Kevin McCarthy]] initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the House investigations "paint a picture of corruption" by Biden and his family.[t] Congressional investigations, including [[United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family]], have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[u] On December 13, 2023, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted 221–212 to formalize an [[Impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden]].[665][666][667]
In February 2024, [[Alexander Smirnov (FBI informant)]], a former intelligence [[Informant]] who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with [[Making false statements]].[668] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[669][670][671]
As part of the [[Joe Biden classified documents incident]], special counsel [[Robert Hur]] said that Biden did not remember when he was vice president ("if it was 2013—when did I stop being vice president?") or when his son Beau died.[680] Hur wrote that his memory "appeared to have significant limitations".[681]
On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for [[COVID-19]] with reportedly mild symptoms.[682][683] According to the White House, he was treated with [[Paxlovid]].[683][684] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[685] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30.[686][687] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[688][689] In 2023, Biden was asked whether any other Democrats could beat Donald Trump.
Ending months of speculation,[691][692] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the [[2024 United States presidential election]], with Harris again as his running mate.[693] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[694] During his campaign, Biden promoted [[Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration]].[695][696] He frequently stated his intention to "finish the job" as a political rallying cry.[693][697][698]
[[U.S. Representative]] [[Dean Phillips]] ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries.[699] Phillips [[Dean Phillips 2024 presidential campaign]] as a younger alternative to Biden,[700] who would be a stronger opponent to Trump in the general election.[701][702] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23, [[2024 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary]], but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote.[703] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and [[2024 South Carolina Democratic presidential primary]] with 96.2% of the vote.[704] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in [[2024 Nevada Democratic presidential primary]] and 81.1% of the vote in [[2024 Michigan Democratic presidential primary]].

The [[2024 Joe Biden–Donald Trump presidential debate]] was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump.
Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[712][713][714] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[v] and polling indicated the majority of viewers believed Trump won.[719] After the debate raised questions about [[Age and health concerns of Joe Biden]], Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from [[List of Democrats who opposed the Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign]][720] and the [[Editorial boards]] of several major news outlets.[721][722]
Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[723] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was "in the best interest of my party and the country".[724] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[725][726] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee.[727] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since [[1968 United States presidential election]].[728]

As a senator, Biden was regarded as a [[Moderate Democrat]].[752] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[753] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by [[Catholic social teaching]].[754][755][756]
According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, Biden represents an Americanized form of [[Christian democracy]], taking positions characteristic of both the [[Center-right]] and [[Center-left]].[757] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[758] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional [[Modern liberalism in the United States]], "a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies...
on a strong federal government for enforcement".[759] In 2022, journalist [[Sasha Issenberg]] wrote that Biden's "most valuable political skill" was "an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party".[760] Some critics claimed Biden's climate policy was [[Socialism]].[761][762][763]

Biden believes action must be taken on [[Climate change]].
As a senator, he co-sponsored the [[Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007]], the most stringent climate bill in the [[United States Senate]].[779] Biden supports [[Nature conservation]].
According to a report from the [[Center for American Progress]], he broke several records in this domain.[780] He took steps to protect [[Old-growth forest]].[781] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].[782] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[783] His program included reentering the [[Paris Agreement]], [[Green building]] and more.[784] Biden supports [[Environmental justice]], including [[Climate justice]] and [[Blue justice]].[w] Biden called global temperature rise above the 1.5 °C limit the "only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war".[789] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a "War on American Energy", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[790]
Biden has said the U.S. needs to "get tough" on China, calling it the "most serious competitor" that poses challenges to the United States' "prosperity, security, and democratic values".[791][792] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the [[Xinjiang]] region to Chinese leader [[Xi Jinping]], pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[793][794] Biden has said he is against [[Regime change]] but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[795] He opposed direct U.S. [[2011 military intervention in Libya]],[796][205] voted against U.S. participation in the [[Gulf War]],[797] voted in favor of the [[Iraq War]],[798] and supports a [[Two-state solution]] in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].[799] Biden pledged to end U.S. support for the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] and to reevaluate the [[Saudi Arabia–United States relations]] with [[Saudi Arabia]].[261] Biden supported extending the [[New START]] arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of [[Nuclear weapon]] deployed by both sides.[800][801] In 2021, Biden officially [[Armenian genocide recognition]] the [[Armenian genocide]], becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[802][x]
Biden supported [[Abortion-rights movements]] throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[805][806] In 2019, he said he supported [[Roe v.
Wade]] and repealing the [[Hyde Amendment]].[807][808] After [[Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health Organization]], he criticized [[Abortion law in the United States by state]] passed in a majority of [[Republican Party (United States)]]-controlled states,[809] and took measures to protect [[Abortion in the United States]].[810] Biden rejected calls to provide abortion services on [[Federal lands]].[811][812] He vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[813][814]
Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy [[United States Senate]],[815][816] which he attributed to having been elected young.[817] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed [[Campaign finance reform in the United States]] measures during his first term.[85] While a senator, Biden was viewed as being close to the credit card company [[MBNA]], a major contributor to his campaigns since 1989, sometimes being called the "senator from MBNA".[818] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[819] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[820][821]
And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better."[33] Journalist [[James Traub]] has written that "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself".[126] Particularly since the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[822][823]
Journalist and TV anchor [[Wolf Blitzer]] has called Biden loquacious;[824] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for "talking too much", leaning in close "like an old pal with something urgent to tell you".[288] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[825] and sometimes "puts his foot in his mouth".[162][826][827] Biden has a reputation for being prone to [[Political gaffe]].[828][829][830] The New York Times wrote that Biden's "weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything".[162]
According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by [[The New Yorker]] in 2014.[831][832] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the [[Civil rights movement]] than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[831] The Times wrote, "Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences."[832]
According to [[Morning Consult]] polling, Biden maintained an [[Opinion poll]] above 50% during his presidency's first eight months.
In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[833] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the [[SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant]], [[2021–2023 inflation surge]], disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[y] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[z] U.S. president after three years in office.[838]
[[Gallup, Inc.]] found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[839][840] but by August, his ratings began to decline.[841] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[842][839] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[838][843] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[842] Additionally, Gallup noted that Biden's public support eroded each year he was in office: he averaged 49% approval in his first year,[844] 41% in his second,[845] 40% in his third,[846] and 39% in his fourth.[847] In July 2024, just before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Gallup found his approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 36%.[848] Gallup found that Biden had an average approval rating of 42.2% throughout his presidency, which was lower than all other presidents' except Trump's first term, at 41.1%.
CNN and CBS News found Biden's final approval rating to be 37% and 36%, respectively.[849][850] Polling aggregator [[FiveThirtyEight]] found that Biden had a final average approval rating of 37%.[851]

A plurality felt the U.S. made progress in only one indicator under Biden: the conditions of [[LGBTQ people]].[860]
Journalist [[Amy Walter]], editor of the nonpartisan [[The Cook Political Report]], argued that the public deemed Biden's presidency a failure particularly due to frustration over inflation.
