Operation Car Wash ([[Portuguese language]]: Operação Lava Jato, Portuguese pronunciation: [opeɾɐˈsɐ̃w lavɐ ˈʒatu]) was a landmark anti-corruption probe in [[Brazil]].[14][15] Beginning in March 2014 as the investigation of a small [[Car wash]] in [[Brasília]] over [[Money laundering]], the proceedings uncovered a massive corruption scheme in the Brazilian federal government, particularly in [[State-owned enterprises]].
The probe was conducted through [[Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica]].
Evidence was collected and presented to the court system by a team of [[Ministério Público Federal]] led by [[Deltan Dallagnol]], while the judge in charge of the operation was [[Sergio Moro]].
The operation implicated leading businessmen, [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]], [[Senate of Brazil]], [[List of Brazilian states]], [[Cabinet of Brazil]], and former presidents [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], [[Temer]] and [[Lula]].
Companies and individuals accused of involvement have agreed to pay 25 billion [[Reais]] in fines and restitution of embezzled public funds.[16]
Part of these bribes was channeled to political parties (particularly the [[Movimento Democrático Brasileiro]], [[Partido dos Trabalhadores]], [[PSDB]] and [[Progressistas]]),[17] in order to illegally fund political campaigns (via [[Caixa dois]]), as well as for personal gain.[18]: 60  The largest amounts of bribes were detected in oil giant [[Petrobras]]; company directors negotiated with contractors to receive illegal kickbacks ranging from 1% to 5% of disbursements.[19] Due to its pervasiveness in Petrobras, the scandal is also known as Petrolão (Portuguese for "big oil").[20] Investigators have also stated that contractors formed a [[Cartel]], involving the country's largest engineering conglomerates such as [[Odebrecht]], Grupo OAS, [[Andrade Gutierrez]], and Carioca Engenharia, to share government contracts among themselves and collude with corrupt politicians.
Allegedly, the cartel also operated in contracts signed directly with government agencies, in projects such as the construction of football stadiums for the [[2014 World Cup]], the [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant]], the [[Belo Monte dam]], and the [[North-South Railway (Brazil)]] and Fiol railways.[21][22] Prosecutors also tracked overseas operations, and cooperated with authorities from 61 countries, among which [[Switzerland]], the United States and [[Peru]] were the most frequent collaborating parties.[19]
Appeals against rulings by Judge Sergio Moro were processed in the [[Judiciary of Brazil]], in which the [[Supreme Federal Court]] (STF) is the [[Court of last resort]].
Some of the contested issues were the stage at which convicted defendants would begin to serve their sentences, and the extensive use of [[Plea bargain]] by prosecutors.
In a 2016 decision penned by STF judge [[Teori Zavascki]], the Court found that prison terms should be served once a sentence was confirmed by the local appeals court.
This was welcomed by prosecutors as an incentive against illegal practices.[23] [[Teori Zavascki]], the judge overseeing the prosecution, died in a plane crash off the coast of [[Paraty]], in January 2017, and the investigation lost a key backer in the Supreme Federal Court.[24] In 2019, the STF reverted its ruling, and decided that prison sentences only take effect in Brazil after all possible appeals to higher courts are exhausted.[25]
In January 2019, Sergio Moro announced that he would resign from his position as a federal judge, to join the incoming administration of right-wing [[President Jair Bolsonaro]] as [[Ministry of Justice (Brazil)]].
The probe's reputation was further damaged by revelations arising from a leak of personal conversations between investigators by hacker [[Walter Delgatti Neto]].
Delgatti hacked the investigative authorities' online communications over [[Telegram (application)]] groups.
Dubbed [[Vaza Jato]], the leak purports to expose undue pre-trial coordination between Judge Moro and prosecutors in the case to produce evidence, direct hearings and discuss possible sentencing.[28] The hacking leak was published in the press by [[The Intercept Brasil]] and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]], who claimed that Moro passed on "advice, investigative leads, and inside information to the prosecutors" to "prevent Lula's [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] from winning" the [[2018 Brazilian general election]].[29] Moro and Dallagnol deny any wrongdoing; they maintain that the contents of the leak have not been confirmed and that, furthermore, no proof of  illegal conduct was present in the leaks.[30][31] Nevertheless, the leaks marked a shift in public opinion, having caused the investigation to lose support.[32] The task force was officially disbanded on 1 February 2021.[33][34]
In March 2019, judge [[Gilmar Mendes]] referred, in a Court session, to Operation Car Wash investigators as "gangsters and scum", adding that their "methods dishonor institutions".[35] In September 2023, STF judge [[Dias Toffoli]] stated that the arrest of [[President Lula]] was a "setup", "one of the gravest errors in the country's judicial history", and declared all evidence obtained from a settlement with [[Odebrecht]] null and void, adding that Operation Car Wash acted as a "21st-century [[Pau de arara]]".[36] Chief prosecutor [[Augusto Aras]] believes that Operation Car Wash left a "cursed legacy".[37]
Ensuing investigations culminated in the identification of four large criminal rings, headed by: Carlos Habib Chater [pt], [[Alberto Youssef]], Nelma Kodama [pt], and [[Raul Henrique Srour]].
Investigation at first focused on the four black-market currency dealers and improper payments to Alberto Youssef by companies who had won contracts at Petrobras' [[Abreu e Lima, Pernambuco]] refinery.
After they discovered that doleiro (black-market dealer) Alberto Youssef had acquired a Range Rover [[Evoque]] for Paulo Roberto Costa [pt], a former director of Petrobras, the investigation expanded nationwide.
Once he was charged, Costa agreed to provide evidence to the investigation.[38] A newly adopted law introduced 'rewarded collaboration' ([[Colaboração premiada]])[a][b] a type of plea bargaining involving sentence reductions for defendants who cooperate in investigations.
Fernando Soares, also known as "Fernando Baiano", a businessman and lobbyist, was allegedly the connection between major Brazilian construction firms and the government formed by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT) and [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB).[40][41] After Costa and Soares, many others agreed to collaborate with the prosecution; between 2014 and February 2016, the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)]] (Portuguese: Ministério Público da União) filed 37 criminal charges against 179 people, mostly politicians and businessmen.[42] In December 2017, nearly three hundred people had been accused of crimes in the scandal.[43] After [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], grandson of the company founder, was sentenced to 19 years in prison, he and other Odebrecht executives were, due to the sentence reduction incentives of the 'rewarded collaboration' law, willing to act as witnesses and to give information about the broader corruption scheme.
Odebrecht had a secret branch[c] used to make illegal payments in several Latin American countries, from [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela to [[Ricardo Martinelli]] in Panama.[15] Odebrecht was given fines totalling $2.6 billion by authorities of Brazil, Switzerland, and the United States after the company admitted bribing officials in twelve countries with some $788 million.[43]
Costa and Youssef entered into a plea bargain with prosecutors and the scope of the investigation widened to nine major Brazilian construction firms: [[Camargo Correa]], Construtora OAS [pt], UTC Engenharia [pt], [[Odebrecht]], Mendes Júnior [pt], Engevix [pt], Queiroz Galvão [pt], IESA Óleo e Gás [pt], and Galvão Engenharia [pt],
as well as politicians involved with Petrobras.
Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]], who chaired the board of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, denied knowledge of any wrongdoing.[44] The [[Brazilian Supreme Court]] authorized the investigation of 48 current and former legislators, including former President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], in March 2016.[20] [[Eduardo Cunha]], president of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] from 2015 to 2016, was convicted of taking approximately $40 million in bribes and hiding funds in secret bank accounts and sentenced to 15 years in prison.[45][46]
On 19 January 2017, a small plane carrying Supreme Court Justice [[Teori Zavascki]] crashed into the sea near the [[Tourist city]] of [[Paraty]] in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]], killing the magistrate and four other people.
A [[Miami Herald]] report noted in September 2017 that when Operation Car Wash began in 2014, fewer than 10,000 electronic monitoring bracelets were in use to enforce [[Home detention]] sentences; by September 2017 the number had ballooned to more than 24,000.[48]
Petrobras delayed reporting its annual financial results for 2014, and in April 2015 released "audited financial statements" showing $2.1 billion in bribes and a total of almost $17 billion in write-downs due to [[Graft (politics)]] and overvalued [[Asset]],[49] which the company characterized as a "conservative" estimate.
Had the report been delayed by another week, Petrobras [[Bondholders]] would have had the right to demand early repayment.
Petrobras also suspended [[Dividend]] payments for 2015.
Due in part to the impact of the scandal, as well as to its high debt burden and the low price of oil, Petrobras was also forced to cut [[Capital expenditure]] and announced it would sell $13.7 billion in assets over the following two years.[49]
The conviction of [[Aldemir Bendine]], Petrobras' former CEO, on corruption charges was annulled by the Supreme Federal Court in 2019 due to objections to the trial procedure.[50]
On 8 March 2016, [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], CEO of [[Odebrecht]] and grandson of the company's founder, was sentenced to 19 years in prison after being convicted of paying more than $30 million in bribes to Petrobras executives.[56][57]
In April 2018, former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] – after having been sentenced for passive corruption and money laundering in relation to a luxury apartment in [[Guarujá]] received from Grupo OAS – entered prison in [[Curitiba]] to serve his 12-year sentence.
On 3 July 2018, failed Brazilian billionaire [[Eike Batista]] was convicted of bribing former Rio de Janeiro governor [[Sérgio Cabral Filho]] for state government contracts, having paid Cabral US$16.6 million, and was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.[59]
[[Emílio Odebrecht]] said in a written report to the [[Attorney General of Brazil]]'s Office (PGR) that he discussed donations to Worker's Party's (PT) campaigns with former PT president Lula.
Financial support, according to the contractor, came even before Lula became president.[60][61] [[Marcelo Odebrecht]] said that the "Amigo" account for former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was created in 2010 with a balance of R$40 million.
In his statement, he said he gave the money to [[Antonio Palocci]], former Finance Minister and Rousseff's chief of staff, who had been the PT's contact with [[Odebrecht]] since the prior administration, when Emílio Alves Odebrecht [pt] and Pedro Novis had handled payments.
He said that in the middle of 2010, at the end of the Lula administration, he knew that [[Dilma Rousseff]] was going to take over and that the balance of the account would be "managed by her at her request".
Police said they had evidence that Lula had received [[Kickbacks]].
Lula's institute called actions against him "arbitrary, illegal and unjustifiable", since he had been cooperating with the investigations.[64] Lula, convicted of accepting bribes worth 3.7 million [[Brazilian real]][d] (1.2 million dollars), was sentenced on 12 July to nine and a half years in prison.[65] He appealed the sentence to the [[Federal Regional Court]]-4, which increased his sentence to twelve years and a month.[66] On 5 April 2018, Moro ordered his imprisonment, and he surrendered two days later.[67]
The plea bargain testimony by Odebrecht Engenharia Industrial's former president Márcio Faria da Silva said that on 15 July 2010, President [[Michel Temer]] led a meeting about an agreement to pay approximately US$40 million in bribes to the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] in exchange for contracts with the international Board of Directors of Petrobras.
According to Faria, Temer, who at the time was a candidate for vice-president on Dilma Rousseff's ticket, delegated to [[Eduardo Cunha]] and [[Henrique Eduardo Alves]], then deputies and present at the meeting, the task of making the payments which represented 5% of the contract's value.
The meeting took place in Temer's political office in [[São Paulo]].
Marcelo Odebrecht said in his plea bargain testimony that the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) party, led by Senator [[Aécio Neves]] (PSDB-MG), received at least 50 million reals in exchange for favoring the business contractor in energy deals.
He said that improper payments were made due to business deals with two state companies: [[Eletrobras Furnas]] and [[Cemig]].
The second state-run investigation was influenced by Aécio during the period when the PSDB was in power in [[Minas Gerais]] (2003–2014).[70][71]
In eleven cases under the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Federal Court]] (STF), investigations implicate father and son, husband and wife, or siblings.
The president of the Chamber, [[Rodrigo Maia]] (DEM-RJ), has the most family members implicated.
Maia was charged in the same investigation as his father, councilor and former mayor [[Cesar Maia]].
The Brazilian Democratic Movement leader of the Senate, [[Renan Calheiros]] (AL), was charged along with his son, the governor of Alagoas [[Renan Filho]] (PMDB), in two inquiries.
They allegedly participated in an agreement to divert resources from work on the Canal do Sertão and also received resources in the form of a [[Slush fund]] they refer to as a [[Caixa 2]].
The governor of [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Robinson Faria]] (PSD), was charged along with his son, federal deputy [[Fábio Faria (politician)]] (PSD-RN).
The president of the PMDB, Senator [[Romero Jucá]] (RR), and his son Rodrigo Jucá both figured in one of the inquiries.
The father helped Odebrecht negotiate a [[Provisional measure]] and obtained an electoral donation of 150,000 reals for his son.
A father asking for a contribution for a son was also why former minister [[José Dirceu]] was investigated along with [[Zeca Dirceu]], federal deputy.
In the [[Chamber of Deputies]], the sons [[Antônio Britto]] (PSD-BA) and [[Daniel Vilela]] (PMDB-GO) were also investigated along with their parents, Edvaldo Brito [pt] (PTB-BA) and [[Maguito Vilela]] (PMDB-GO).
Senator [[Kátia Abreu]] (PMDB-TO) was accompanied by her husband Moisés Pinto Gomes, who brokered cash payments for her in 2014.
Senator [[Vanessa Grazziotin]] (PCdoB-AM) is accompanied by her husband, Eron Bezerra [pt], said to have asked for slush fund cash donations for her.
Federal Deputy [[Décio Nery de Lima]] (PT-SC) also requested slush funds for the [[Blumenau]] municipal campaign in 2012 of his wife, state deputy Ana Paula Lima (PT-SC).
The Viana brothers of [[Acre (state)]], Governor [[Tião Viana]] (PT) and Senator [[Jorge Viana]] (PT), were also charged together.
Marcelo Odebrecht detailed the payment of 100 million reals for the 2014 presidential campaign of Rousseff, requested by then-minister [[Guido Mantega]].[78] The payment was allegedly tied to the approval of Provisional Measure 613, which assisted [[Braskem]], an arm of Odebrecht, and dealt with the Special Chemical Industry Regime (Reiq), and tax incentives to stimulate [[Ethanol]] production.[79] The former executive said that this was not a direct exchange of favors as was, he says, the negotiation of the 50 million reals passed on to the government for the creation of Crisis Refis to solve the crisis caused by zero Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados [pt] ("Industrialized Products Tax"; IPI),[80] but that the then-minister knew that he was talking to someone who had given money to João Santana [pt].
Former Odebrecht Institutional Relations Director Alexandrino Alencar [pt] stated that former minister [[Edinho Silva]], when he became treasurer of Dilma Rousseff's campaign in 2014, asked for two donations from five parties to support the Force of the People, at 7 million reals each.[82] The PCdoB, PDT, PRB, PROS, and PP received the illegal donations, according to the former director of Odebrecht.
On 5 November 2017, the [[Paradise Papers]], a set of confidential [[Electronic document]] relating to [[Offshore investment]], revealed that Odebrecht used at least one [[Offshore company]] as a vehicle for paying the bribes uncovered through the Operation Car Wash investigation.
During the governments of [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and [[Néstor Kirchner]], Odebrecht was awarded overvalued contracts worth at least US$9.6 billion.[85]
In Mexico, the former director of the state-owned oil company [[Pemex]], a close ally of President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], is suspected of receiving US$10 million in bribes from Odebrecht.[86]
[[Ramón Fonseca Mora]], president of [[Panama]]'s [[Panameñista Party]], was dismissed in March 2016 due to his involvement in the scandal.[87] The [[Panama Papers]] resulted from a hack of his law firm's computer systems.
Fonseca and his business partner [[Jürgen Mossack]] were arrested and jailed in February 2017.[88] They were released in April 2017 after a judge ruled they had cooperated with the investigation and ordered them each to pay $500,000 in bail.[89][90]
During the [[2016 Peruvian general election]] in February 2016, a report by the [[Brazilian Federal Police]] implicated President [[Ollanta Humala]] in bribery by Odebrecht for public works contracts.
President Humala denied the charge and has avoided questions from the media on this matter.[91][92] In July 2017, Humala and his wife were arrested and held in pre-trial detention following investigations into his involvement in the Odebrecht scandal.[93][94] Investigations revealed that Brazilian president [[Lula da Silva]] pressured Odebrecht to pay millions of dollars toward Humala's presidential campaign.[95]
In December 2017 Peru's President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] appeared before [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]] to defend himself against [[Impeachment of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] over allegations of covering up illegal payments of $782,000 from Odebrecht to Kuczynski's company Westfield Group Capital Ltd.
[[Keiko Fujimori]], who had lost the 2016 presidential elections to Kuczynski by a margin of fewer than 50,000 votes, was championing impeachment; her party had already forced out five government ministers.
Fujimori herself was later implicated in the Odebrecht scandal over alleged campaign contributions[96] and on 31 October 2018, a judge sent her to 36 months of pretrial detention.[97] Kuczynski [[Resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] on 21 March 2018[98] and was sent to pretrial detention on 10 April 2019.[99]
On 17 April 2019, [[Alan García]], a former President of Peru who was also implicated in the scandal, died by suicide after shooting himself in the head while police attempted to arrest him.[100]
Former president [[Alejandro Toledo]] (2001–2006) was also implicated in the bribery scandal, and was arrested in [[Redwood City, California]] in July 2019 for allegedly taking bribes in connection with a highway construction contract.[101]
In late 2017, Euzenando Prazeres de Azevedo, president of Constructora Odebrecht in Venezuela, told investigators that Odebrecht had made $35 million in campaign contributions to [[Nicolas Maduro]]'s [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election]] in return for Odebrecht projects receiving priority in Venezuela,[102] that Americo Mata, Maduro's campaign manager, initially asked for $50 million for Maduro, settled in the end for $35 million.[102][103] In May 2018, [[Transparency International]] showed that only 9 of 33 projects started by Odebrecht in Venezuela between 1999 and 2013 were completed.[104]
One of Singapore's prominent government-linked companies, [[Keppel Corporation]], is also implicated in the Petrobras' corruption scandals.[105] Information of involvement is confirmed in the plea bargain Keppel Corporation reached with US DOJ.
On 9 June 2019, [[Glenn Greenwald]] and other journalists from [[Investigative journalism]] magazine [[The Intercept Brasil]] started publishing several leaked chat messages exchanged via the [[Telegram (software)]] app between members of the Brazilian [[Judiciary system]].
Some, including then Car Wash judge and former [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security (Brazil)]] [[Sergio Moro]] and lead prosecutor [[Deltan Dallagnol]] are accused of violating legal procedure during the investigation, trial and arrest of former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] allegedly for the sake of preventing him from running for a third term in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]], among other crimes.
Other news agencies, such as [[Folha de São Paulo]] and [[Veja (magazine)]], confirmed the authenticity of the messages and worked in partnership with The Intercept Brasil to sort the rest of the material in their possession before releasing it.[107][108][109][110][111][112][113][114]
On 23 July, [[Brazilian Federal Police]] made public that they had arrested and were investigating a hacker from [[Araraquara]], Walter Delgatti Neto, for breaking into the authorities' Telegram accounts.
Neto confessed to the hack and to having given the [[Chat log]] to Greenwald.
Police said the attack had been perpetrated by abusing Telegram's phone number verification and exploiting vulnerabilities in [[Voicemail]] technology in use in Brazil using a [[Spoofing attack]] phone number.
The Intercept neither confirmed nor denied that Neto was their source and cited provisions for [[Freedom of the press]] in the 1988 [[Brazilian Constitution]].[115]
Greenwald has faced death threats and homophobic harassment from supporters of President [[Jair Bolsonaro]] due to his reporting on the Telegram messages.[116] A New York Times profile of Greenwald and his husband [[David Miranda (politician)]], a left-wing congressman, said the couple have become targets of homophobia from Bolsonaro supporters as a result of the reporting.[117] The Washington Post reported that Greenwald had been targeted with tax investigations by the Bolsonaro government as retaliation for the reporting,[118] while AP called Greenwald's reporting the first test case for a free press in the Bolsonaro era.[119]
After Bolsonaro explicitly threatened to imprison Greenwald for this reporting,[121] Supreme Court justice [[Gilmar Mendes]] ruled that any investigation of Greenwald in connection with the reporting would be illegal under the Brazilian constitution, calling [[Freedom of the press]] a "pillar of democracy".[122]
Greenwald reported that the leaked file is bigger than the one in the [[Edward Snowden]] case.[109][123] [[Fernando Haddad]] considered the leaks to have the potential to become the "greatest institutional scandal in the history of the Brazilian republic".[124][109]
In response to the leaks, several top jurisprudence authorities and experts in Europe and the Americas, such as [[Susan Rose-Ackerman]] (praised by Car Wash prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol as the world's top corruption expert), [[Bruce Ackerman]], and Luigi Ferrajoli, voiced their shock at the conduct of the Brazilian authorities and described former President Lula as a political prisoner, calling for his release.[125][126]
In March 2020, the Intercept reported that Brazilian prosecutors had secretly collaborated with the [[US Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in a manner "that may have violated international legal treaties and Brazilian law".
Bolsonaro's attorney general [[Augusto Aras]] complained that the investigations went too far, and were biased politically, and campaigned against it, gaining support from Bolsonaro family members such as their son Flavio who was caught up in it.
One is the 2017 film Polícia Federal: A Lei É para Todos (Federal Police: The Law Is for Everyone), directed by Marcelo Antunez, and the other is the Netflix series [[The Mechanism (TV series)]] (2018–2019).
