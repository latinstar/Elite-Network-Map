The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is an [[Independent agency of the United States government]] responsible for [[Consumer protection]] in the [[Financial sector]].
CFPB's jurisdiction includes [[Bank]], [[Credit union]], securities firms, [[Payday loans in the United States]], mortgage-servicing operations, [[Foreclosure]] relief services, [[Debt collector]], for-profit colleges, and other financial companies operating in the United States.
The agency was originally proposed in 2007 by [[Elizabeth Warren]] while she was a law professor and she played an instrumental role in its establishment.[2][3] The CFPB's creation was authorized by the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the [[2008 financial crisis]] and the subsequent [[Great Recession]],[4] and is an independent bureau within the [[Federal Reserve]].[5]
In June 2020, the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Seila Law LLC v.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] that the president [[Unitary executive theory]] the director without cause but allowed the agency to remain in operation.
Community Financial Services Ass'n of America, Ltd.]] the constitutionality of the CFPB funding mechanism prescribed by Congress.[10] At the outset of his [[Second presidency of Donald Trump]], [[Donald Trump]] appointed an acting director who immediately ordered the CFPB to stop regulatory activity,[11] and sought to fire 90% of the agency's staff.[12]
According to former director [[Richard Cordray]], the bureau's priorities are mortgages, credit cards and [[Student loans]].[4][13] The CFPB qualifies as a large independent agency that was designed to consolidate its employees and responsibilities from a number of other federal regulatory bodies, including the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], the [[National Credit Union Administration]] and even the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]].[14] The bureau is an independent unit located inside and funded by the [[United States Federal Reserve]], with interim affiliation with the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].[15] The CFPB's Federal Reserve-based funding has come under scrutiny by the bureau's critics.[16][17]
The CFPB writes and enforces rules for financial institutions, examines both bank and [[Non-bank financial institution]], monitors and reports on markets, as well as collects and tracks consumer complaints.[13]
The CFPB opened its website in early February 2011 to accept suggestions from consumers via [[YouTube]], [[Twitter]], and its own website interface.
According to the [[United States Treasury Department]], the bureau is tasked with the responsibility to "promote fairness and transparency for [[Mortgage loan]], [[Credit card]], and other consumer [[Financial product]] and services".[18] According to its website, the CFPB's "central mission...is to make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americans—whether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products".[19] In 2016 alone most of the hundreds and thousands of consumer complaints about their financial services—including banks and credit card issuers—were received and compiled by CFPB and are publicly available on a federal government database.[20]
Once a [[Financial institution]] acquires $10 [[Billion]] in [[Assets]],[clarification needed] it falls under the guidance, rules, and [[Regulations]] under the CFPB- is  a "CFPB regulated bank".
The regulations implemented by the bureau are in Chapter X of Title XII Banks and Banking of the US [[Code of Federal Regulations]].
Notable examples include the ECOA ([[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] – Regulation B), HMDA ([[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] – Regulation C), [[Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982]] (Regulation D), EFTA ([[Electronic Fund Transfer Act]] – Regulation E), FDCPA ([[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] – Regulation F), FCRA ([[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] – Regulation V), RESPA ([[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] – Regulation X), TILA ([[Truth in Lending Act]] – Regulation Z), and [[Truth in Savings Act]] (Regulation DD).[22][23]
In July 2010, Congress passed the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], during the [[111th United States Congress]] in response to the [[Great Recession]] and [[2008 financial crisis]].[4] The agency was originally proposed in 2007 by then-[[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Elizabeth Warren]], who later became a US senator.[24] The proposed CFPB was actively supported by [[Americans for Financial Reform]], a newly created umbrella organization of some 250 consumer, labor, civil rights and other activist organizations.[25]
On September 17, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] announced the appointment of Warren as [[Assistant to the President]] and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency.[26][27] Due to the way the legislation creating the bureau was written, until the first director was in place, the agency was not able to write new rules or supervise financial institutions other than banks.[28]
Elizabeth Warren, who proposed and established the CFPB, was removed from consideration as the bureau's first formal director after [[Obama administration]] officials became convinced Warren could not overcome strong [[Republican Party (United States)]] opposition.[29] On July 17, Obama nominated former [[Ohio Attorney General]] and [[Ohio State Treasurer]] [[Richard Cordray]] to be the first formal director of the CFPB.[30] Prior to his nomination, Cordray had been hired as chief of enforcement for the agency.[31]
However, Cordray's nomination was immediately in jeopardy due to 44 [[United States Senate]] Republicans vowing to derail any nominee in order to encourage a decentralized structure of the organization.
Since the CFPB database was established in 2011, more than four million complaints have been published.[35] CFPB supporters include the [[Consumers Union]] claim that it is a "vital tool that can help consumers make informed decisions".[20] CFPB detractors argue that the CFPB database is a "gotcha game" and that there is already a database maintained by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] although that information is not available to the public.[20]
On January 4, 2012, [[Barack Obama]] issued a [[Recess appointment]] to install Cordray as director through the end of 2013.
This was a highly controversial move as the Senate was still holding [[Pro forma]] sessions, and the possibility existed that the appointment could be challenged in court.[36] This type of recess appointment was unanimously ruled unconstitutional in [[NLRB v.
The [[Financial CHOICE Act]], proposed by the House Financial Services Committee's [[Jeb Hensarling]], to repeal the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], passed the House on June 8, 2017.
[[Barry Loudermilk]] (R-GA) said at one such congressional hearing, "Is the purpose of the database just to name and shame companies?
That's really what I see happening here." Bill Himpler, executive vice president of the [[American Financial Services Association]], a trade group representing banks and other lenders responded "Something needs to be done." "Once the damage is done to a company, it's hard to get your reputation back.[20]
[[Mick Mulvaney]], as acting director of the CFPB, removed all 25 members of the agency's Consumer Advisory Board on June 5, 2018, after eleven of them held a press conference on June 3 in which they criticized him.[41]
On February 13, 2021, President [[Joe Biden]] formally submitted to the Senate the nomination of [[Rohit Chopra]] to serve as director of the CFPB.[42] His nomination was approved on September 30, 2021, by a 50–48 vote.[43]
In December 2021, CFPB fined [[LendUp]] $100,000 due to deceptive marketing and fair lending violations, and the company was required to stop issuing new loans.[44]
In June 2024, the CFPB proposed banning using medical debt in credit reports or loan decisions.[45] In July 2024, the CFPB gave [[Zelle]] a choice between a settlement or litigation around its handling of fraud and scams on its platform.[46]
On February 1, 2025, Chopra was fired by President [[Donald Trump]], making deputy director [[Zixta Martinez]] the acting director of the agency by operation of law.[47][48] On February 3, Trump named [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] and former hedge fund manager [[Scott Bessent]] as the agency's acting director.
Bessent immediately ordered the agency to halt all work.[49] On February 7, [[Office of Management and Budget]] Director [[Russell Vought]] emailed CFPB staff to let them know he was the acting director of the agency.[50] On February 10, Vought ordered all CFPB staff to cease all work between February 10 and 14, and closed the CFPB Washington headquarters.[11][51]
In February 2025, the bureau became a target of the [[Department of Government Efficiency]], the [[Elon Musk]]-led team carrying out part of Trump's cost-cutting agenda.
Staffers gained access to consumers' data.[52] As of February 14, 2025, the agency's website homepage displays a [[HTTP 404]], however other pages on the site remain active.[53] All content from the agency's social media accounts have been removed.[53] CFPB workers have accused Musk of having a [[Conflict of interest]], as the agency was investigating several of his companies.[54] "A public database shows hundreds of complaints about the electric car company Tesla, mostly concerning debt collection or loan problems," states the New York Times.[55] Helaine Olen, from the [[American Economic Liberties Project]], argues that closing down the CFPB "is an overt power grab by Big Tech — and their gain could result in the rest of us losing much more than almost anyone realizes."[56]
The CFPB has created a number of [[Personal finance]] tools for consumers, including Ask CFPB, which compiles plain-language answers to personal finance questions, and Paying for College, which estimates the cost of attending specific universities based on the [[Student financial aid (United States)]] offers a student has received.[63][64]
In 2014, the CFPB attempted to help consumers understand the risks of [[Cryptocurrency]].[65]
A 2013 press release from the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] criticized the CFPB for what was described as a "radical structure" that "is controlled by a single individual who cannot be fired for poor performance and who exercises sole control over the agency, its hiring and its budget." Moreover, the committee alleged a lack of financial transparency and a lack of accountability to Congress or the president.
Committee vice chairman [[Patrick McHenry]], expressed particular concern about travel costs and a $55 million renovation of CFPB headquarters, stating "$55 million is more than the entire annual construction and acquisition budget for [[General Services Administration]] for the totality of federal buildings."[68]
[[Ally Financial]] paid $98 million in fines and settlement fees in 2013.[71] As the agency's methodology means it can only guess who may be victims of discrimination entitled to settlement funds, as of late 2015, the CFPB had yet to compensate any individuals who were victims of Ally's allegedly discriminatory practices.[71] In 2016, the House voted to overturn its 2013 guidance, with 88 Democrats joining House Republicans.[72]
On May 21, 2018, US president Donald Trump signed into law Congressional legislation repealing the enforcement of automobiles lending rules.[73]  On May 24, 2018, Trump signed into law the [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act]], exempting dozens of banks from the CFPB's regulations.[74]
On September 26, 2013, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 3193; 113th Congress)]] was introduced into the United States House of Representatives.[75] The bill would have created a five-person commission and removed it from the Federal Reserve System.[76] The CFPB would have been renamed the "Financial Product Safety Commission".
The first one, filed on June 21, 2012, by a Texas bank along with the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], challenged the constitutionality of provisions of the CFPB.[79] In August 2013, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit because the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had suffered harm.[80]
In July 2015, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the bank, but not the states that later joined the lawsuit, had standing to challenge the law, and returned the case for further proceedings.[81][82]
Pisinski, challenged the constitutionality of the CFPB.[83][84] The complaint, filed in the U.S. [[District Court for the District of Columbia]], alleged that the "CFPB's structure insulates it from political accountability and internal checks and balances in violation of the United States Constitution.
Unbridled from constitutionally-required accountability, CFPB has engaged in [[Ultra vires]] and abusive practices, including attempts to regulate the practice of law (a function reserved for state bars), attempts to collect attorney-client protected material, and overreaching demands for, and mining of, personal financial information of American citizens, which has prompted a Government Accountability Office ("GAO") investigation, commenced on July 12, 2013."[85]
On August 22, 2013, one month after Morgan Drexen's lawsuit, the CFPB filed its own lawsuit against Morgan Drexen in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] alleging that Morgan Drexen charged advance fees for debt relief services in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule and engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).[86] The CFPB won this lawsuit and Morgan Drexen was ordered to pay $132,882,488 in restitution and a $40 million civil penalty.[87]
In October 2016, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that it was unconstitutional for the CFPB director to be removable by the [[President of the United States]] only for cause, such as "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance."[88] Circuit Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]], joined by Senior Circuit Judge [[A.
Raymond Randolph]], wrote that the law was "a threat to individual liberty" and instead found that the president could remove the CFPB director at will.[88]  Circuit Judge [[Karen L.
Henderson]] agreed that the CFPB Director had been wrong in adopting a new interpretation of the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]], finding the [[Statute of limitations]] did not apply to the CFPB, and fining the petitioning mortgage company [[PHH Corporation]] $109 million, but she dissented from giving the president a new power to remove the director, citing [[Constitutional avoidance]].[89] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the decision and ordered [[En banc]] review.[90] On January 31, 2018, the en banc D.C. Circuit found that the CFPB's structure was constitutional by a vote of 7–3.
Judge [[Cornelia Pillard]], writing for the majority, found that the [[Take Care Clause]] does not forbid [[Independent agencies of the United States government]], while each of the circuit judges from the earlier panel wrote separate dissents.[91]
In June 2018, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] judge [[Loretta Preska]] ruled against its structure.[92][93]
In January 2019, the Supreme Court denied review of the DC Circuit Court decision.[94]
"Such an agency lacks a foundation in historical practice and clashes with constitutional structure by concentrating power in a unilateral actor insulated from Presidential control," Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote in the majority opinion, which was joined by his conservative colleagues.[97] The statutes around the Director's position on the CFPB were considered [[Severability]] from the remaining structure of the CFPB, and the Court ordered that "The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will." The dissenting opinion, written by Justice [[Elena Kagan]], stated that the majority's decision has the court "second-guessing" the two political branches of government (Congress and the president) on how to structure the executive branch and "wipes out a feature of [the CFPB] its creators thought fundamental to its mission—a measure of independence from political pressure."[98]
On November 24, 2017, Director Cordray appointed [[Leandra English]] to the position of deputy director, and announced that he would leave office at the close of business that day.[99][100] Cordray indicated that would make English the acting director after his resignation,[101] citing provisions of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] providing that the deputy director of the CFPB becomes acting director in the "absence or unavailability" of the director.[102] Later the same day, however, President [[Donald Trump]] appointed the incumbent director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], [[Mick Mulvaney]], as acting director, citing the authority of the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]].[102]
On November 25, the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] released an opinion, written by Assistant Attorney General [[Steven Engel]], asserting that the President has the authority under the FVRA to designate an acting CFPB Director.
On November 26, English (represented by former CFPB senior counsel [[Deepak Gupta (attorney)]]) filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] seeking a temporary restraining order and declaratory judgment to prevent Mulvaney from becoming acting director,[106] Mulvaney was given access by unnamed individuals with the keys to the director's office on November 27 and ordered all CFPB employees to disregard any claims from English that she is the acting director.[107] Both English and Mulvaney sent emails to the entire 1,600-person staff of the CFPB, each signing as "Acting Director" of the agency.[108][109] On November 28, 2017, U.S. District Judge [[Timothy J.
Kelly]], who had been appointed by President Trump just a few months earlier, denied English's motion for a [[Preliminary injunction]] and allowed Mulvaney to begin serving as CFPB acting director.[110]
As part of its investigation, the CFPB issued a [[Civil investigative demand]] (CID) to Seila Law, which required Seila Law to produce certain documents.
The CFPB brought a motion to enforce the CID to the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]], where District Judge [[Josephine Staton]] granted the motion after finding the CFPB was constitutionally structured.[111]
Seila Law's appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] was dismissed.
The 9th Circuit panel affirmed the District Court's ruling, and agreed that the Supreme Court's prior decisions upholding for-cause removal in Humphrey's Executor and Morrison were "controlling".[112] It also referred approvingly to the en banc decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in PHH Corp.
There was arguably a [[Circuit split]] on the question presented in Seila Law.
While the Ninth Circuit and DC Circuit had held that the CFPB's structure is constitutional, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in [[Collins v.
Mnuchin]] (2018) held that the structure of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]]—another agency whose director can be removed only for cause—violated the separation of powers.[114]
The Supreme Court granted [[Certiorari]] in Seila Law on October 18, 2019, and heard oral argument on March 3, 2020.[115]
The Court recognized that the statutes around the director of the CFPB was [[Severability]] from the rest of the statute establishing the agency, and thus "The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will."[116]
Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote the majority opinion joined by conservative Justices [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]].
Roberts wrote that the CFPB structure with a single point of leadership that could only be removed for cause "has no foothold in history or tradition", and has only been used in four other instances: three current uses for the [[United States Office of Special Counsel]], the [[Social Security Administration]], and the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and temporarily for one year during the [[American Civil War]] for the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]].[98] Roberts wrote that the three current uses "are modern and contested.
Justice [[Elena Kagan]] wrote the dissent joined by justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer]], and [[Sonia Sotomayor]].
In 2018, the [[Community Financial Services Association of America]] sued the CFPB over its 2017 rule that blocked lenders to attempt to collect funds from borrowers' accounts after two consecutive failed attempts, unless the borrower had consented.
While the district court ruled against the association, the [[Fifth Circuit]] ruled in favor of the association in October 2022, deeming that its funding structure was unconstitutional.[119]
That opinion was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which reversed the 5th Circuit and upheld the CFPB's funding mechanism.[120] In May 2024, the Court ruled for the CFPB in a 7-2 decision written by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].[121]
