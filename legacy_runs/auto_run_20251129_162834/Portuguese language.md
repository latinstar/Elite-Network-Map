Portuguese ([[Endonym]]: português or língua portuguesa) is a [[Western Romance language]] of the [[Indo-European language family]] originating from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of [[Europe]].
With approximately 267 million speakers, it is listed as the [[List of languages by number of native speakers]].
Portuguese-speaking people or nations are known as [[Lusophone]] (lusófono).
Portuguese is part of the [[Iberian Romance languages]], which evolved from several dialects of [[Vulgar Latin]] in the medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and the [[County of Portugal]], and has retained some [[Gallaecian language]] phonology.[7][8]
These are seen in [[Portuguese phonology]], [[Portuguese orthography]], [[Portuguese grammar]], and [[Portuguese vocabulary]].
Phonologically, Portuguese has a rich system of [[Nasal vowels]], complex consonant variations, and different types of [[Guttural R]] and other sounds in European and Brazilian varieties.
Its spelling, based like English on the [[Latin alphabet]], is largely [[Phonemic spelling]] but is influenced by [[Etymology]] and tradition.
[[Portuguese spelling reform of 1990]] attempted to create a unified spelling for the Portuguese language across [[List of countries and territories where Portuguese is an official language]].
Portuguese grammar retains many [[Latin verbs]] and has some unique features such as the [[Portuguese conjugation]] and the [[Portuguese grammar#Infinitive form]].
The vocabulary is derived mostly from Latin but also includes numerous loanwords [pt] from Celtic, Germanic, Arabic, African, Amerindian, and Asian languages, resulting from historical contact including wars, trade, and [[Portuguese colonization]].
There is significant [[Variation (linguistics)]] in dialects of Portuguese worldwide, with two primary [[Standard language]]: [[European Portuguese]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese]], each one having numerous [[Regional accent]] and [[Subdialect]].
African and Asian varieties generally follow the European written standard, though they often have different [[Phonological]], [[Lexical item]], and sometimes [[Syntax]].
While there is broad [[Mutual intelligibility]] among varieties, variation is seen mostly in speech patterns and vocabulary, with some regional differences in grammar.
When the [[Roman people]] arrived in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 216 BC, they brought with them the [[Latin language]], from which all [[Romance languages]] are descended.
The language was spread by Roman commoners, merchants, and soldiers, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous [[Celts]] civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals.
For that reason, the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older, [[Atlantic Europe]] [[Megalithic Culture]][9] and [[Celts]],[10] part of the [[Hispano-Celtic languages]] of ancient languages.[11] In Latin, the Portuguese language is known as lusitana or (latina) lusitanica, after the [[Lusitanians]], a pre-Celtic tribe that lived in the territory of present-day Portugal and Spain that adopted the Latin language as Roman settlers moved in.
This is also the origin of the luso- prefix, seen in terms like "[[Lusophone]]".
Between AD 409 and AD 711, as the [[Roman Empire]] collapsed in [[Western Europe]], the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by [[Germanic peoples]] of the [[Migration Period]].
The occupiers, most notably [[Suebi]][12][13] but also [[Visigoths]] and [[Buri tribe]][14] originally spoke [[Germanic languages]].
Quickly, they adopted late Roman culture and the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local population.
With the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] beginning in 711, [[Arabic]] became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions, but most of the [[Mozarabs]] continued to speak a form of [[Ibero-Romance]] called [[Andalusi Romance]] which introduced a few hundred words from Arabic, [[Persian language]], [[Turkish language]], and [[Berber languages]].[15] Like other Neo-Latin and European languages, Portuguese has adopted a significant number of [[Loanword]] from [[Greek language]],[16] mainly in technical and scientific terminology.
Portuguese evolved from the medieval language spoken in the northwestern medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia]], which the [[County of Portugal]] once formed part of.
This variety has been retrospectively named [[Galician–Portuguese]], Old Portuguese, or Old Galician by linguists.[17]
This phase is known as Proto-Portuguese, which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the [[County of Portugal]] from the [[Kingdom of León]], which had by then assumed reign over [[Galicia (Spain)]].
For some time, it was the language of preference for [[Lyric poetry]] in Christian [[Hispania]], much as [[Occitan language]] was the language of the poetry of the [[Troubadours]] in France.
The Occitan digraphs lh and nh, used in its classical orthography, were adopted by the [[Portuguese alphabet#Basic digraphs]], presumably by [[Gerald of Braga]],[18] a monk from [[Moissac]], who became bishop of [[Braga]] in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical Occitan norms.[19] Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under King [[Afonso I of Portugal]].
In 1290, King [[Denis of Portugal]] created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon (the Estudos Gerais, which later moved to [[University of Coimbra]]) and decreed for Portuguese, then simply called the "common language", to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.
In the second period of Old Portuguese, in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the [[Age of Discovery]], the language was taken to many regions of Africa, Asia, and the [[Americas]].
By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a [[Lingua franca]] in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities.
Its spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with [[Catholic Church]] [[Missionary]] efforts, which led to the formation of [[Creole language]] such as that called [[Kristang language]] in many parts of Asia (from the word cristão, "Christian").
Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal.
The end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the Cancioneiro Geral by [[Garcia de Resende]], in 1516.
The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from [[Classical Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] because of the [[Renaissance]] (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin during that time), which greatly enriched the lexicon.
Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]] once called Portuguese "the sweet and gracious language", while the Brazilian poet [[Olavo Bilac]] described it as a última flor do Lácio, inculta e bela ("the last flower of [[Latium]], naïve and beautiful").[21][22][23][24][25] Portuguese is also termed "the language of Camões", after [[Luís Vaz de Camões]], one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese [[Epic poem]] [[The Lusiads]].[26][27][28]
In March 2006, the [[Museum of the Portuguese Language]], an interactive museum about the Portuguese language, was founded in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, the city with the greatest number of Portuguese language speakers in the world.[29] The museum is the first of its kind in the world.[29] In 2015 the museum was partially destroyed in a fire,[30] but restored and reopened in 2020.[31]
It is the native language of the vast majority of the people in Portugal,[33] Brazil[34] and São Tomé and Príncipe (95%).[35] Around 45% of the population of urban Angola speaks Portuguese natively,[36] with approximately 85% fluent; these rates are lower in the countryside.[37] Just over 50% (and rapidly increasing) of the population of [[Mozambique]] are native speakers of Portuguese, and 70% are fluent, according to the 2007 census.[38] Portuguese is also spoken natively by 30% of the population in Guinea-Bissau, and a Portuguese-based creole is understood by all.[39] Almost 50% of the East Timorese are fluent in Portuguese.
No data is available for Cape Verde, but almost all the population is bilingual, and the monolingual population speaks the Portuguese-based [[Cape Verdean Creole]].
Portuguese is mentioned in the [[Constitution of South Africa]] as one of the languages spoken by communities within the country for which the [[Pan South African Language Board]] was charged with promoting and ensuring respect.[40]
There are also significant Portuguese-speaking immigrant communities in many territories including [[Andorra]] (17.1%),[41] [[Bermuda]],[42] [[Canada]] (400,275 people in the 2006 census),[43] [[France]] (1,625,000 people),[44] [[Japan]] (400,000 people),[45] [[Jersey]],[46] [[Luxembourg]] (about 25% of the population as of 2021), [[Namibia]] (about 4–5% of the population, mainly refugees from Angola in the north of the country),[47] [[Paraguay]] (10.7% or 636,000 people),[48] [[Switzerland]] (550,000 in 2019, learning + mother tongue),[49] [[Venezuela]] (554,000),[50] and the United States (0.35% of the population or 1,228,126 speakers according to the 2007 [[American Community Survey]]).[51]
In some parts of former [[Portuguese India]], namely [[Goa]][52] and [[Daman and Diu]],[53] the language is still spoken by about 10,000 people.
The [[Kristang people]] in [[Malaysia]] speak [[Kristang language]], a Portuguese-Malay creole; however, the Portuguese language itself is not widely spoken in the country.
The [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]][55]
(in Portuguese Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa, with the Portuguese acronym CPLP) consists of the nine independent countries that have Portuguese as an [[Official language]]: [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[East Timor]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]], [[Portugal]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].[55]
[[Equatorial Guinea]] made a formal application for full membership to the CPLP in June 2010, a status given only to states with Portuguese as an official language.[56] Portuguese became its third official language (besides [[Spanish language]] and [[French language]])[57] in 2011, and in July 2014, the country was accepted as a member of the CPLP.[58]
Portuguese is also one of the official languages of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China of Macau (alongside [[Chinese language]]) and of several international organizations, including [[Mercosul]],[59] the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]],[60] the [[Union of South American Nations]],[61] the [[Organization of American States]],[62] the [[African Union]],[63] the [[Economic Community of West African States]],[63] the [[Southern African Development Community]][63] and the [[European Union]].[64]
According to [[The World Factbook]]'s country population estimates for 2018, the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows (by descending order):
The combined population of the entire [[Lusophone]] area was estimated at 300 million in January 2022.[67][66][74] This number does not include the Lusophone [[Diaspora]], estimated at 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians), although there are no official accurate figures for diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language.
Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries]] emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.
Portuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in [[Uruguay]].[75] Other countries where Portuguese is commonly taught in schools or where it has been introduced as an option include [[Venezuela]],[76] [[Zambia]],[77] the [[Republic of the Congo]],[78] [[Senegal]],[78] [[Namibia]],[47] [[Eswatini]],[78] [[South Africa]],[78] [[Ivory Coast]],[79] and [[Mauritius]].[80] In 2017, a project was launched to introduce Portuguese as a school subject in [[Zimbabwe]].[81][82] Also, according to Portugal's Minister of Foreign Affairs, the language will be part of the school curriculum of a total of 32 countries by 2020.[83] In such countries, Portuguese is spoken either as a native language by vast majorities due to their Portuguese colonial past or as a [[Lingua franca]] in bordering and multilingual regions, such as on the Brazilian borders of Uruguay and Paraguay and in regions of Angola and Namibia.
There remain communities of thousands of Portuguese (or [[Creole language]]) first language speakers in [[Goa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Daman and Diu]], and other areas due to [[Portuguese Empire]].
In [[Timor-Leste]], the number of Portuguese speakers is quickly increasing as Portuguese and Brazilian teachers are making great strides in teaching Portuguese in the schools all over the island.[84] Additionally, there are many large Portuguese-speaking immigrant communities all over the world.
According to estimates by [[UNESCO]], Portuguese is the fastest-growing [[European language]] after [[English language]] and the language has, according to the newspaper [[The Portugal News]] publishing data given from UNESCO, the highest potential for growth as an international language in [[Southern Africa]] and [[South America]].[86] Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents, and as a second language by millions worldwide.
Since 1991, when Brazil signed into the economic community of [[Mercosul]] with other South American nations, namely [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]], Portuguese is either mandatory, or taught, in the schools of those South American countries.
Although early in the 21st century, after [[Macau]] was returned to [[China]] and immigration of Brazilians of [[Japanese Brazilian]] to [[Japan]] slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in [[Asia]], it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries in the world.[87][88]
It is one of twenty official languages of the [[European Union]], an official language of NATO, the [[Organization of American States]] (alongside Spanish, French and English), and one of eighteen official languages of the [[European Space Agency]].
Portuguese is a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] (alongside English, German, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian), [[Amnesty International]] (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, French, German, and Italian), and [[Médecins sans Frontières]] (used alongside English, Spanish, French and Arabic), in addition to being the official legal language in the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]], also in [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], an international organization formed essentially by [[Lusophone]].
With approximately 250 million native speakers and 17 million [[Second language]] speakers, Portuguese has approximately 267 million total speakers.[89] It is usually listed as the [[List of languages by number of native speakers]],[90] the third-most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers[91] and the second-most spoken [[Romance languages]] in the world, surpassed only by [[Spanish language]].
Being the first most widely spoken language in [[South America]][92][93][94] and the most-spoken language in the [[Southern Hemisphere]],[95][96][97] it is also the second-most spoken language, after Spanish, in [[Latin America]], one of the 10 most spoken languages in [[Africa]],[98] and an official language of the [[European Union]], [[Mercosul]], the [[Organization of American States#Official languages]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[African Union]], and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], an international organization made up of all of the world's officially [[Lusophone]] nations.
Portuguese belongs to the [[West Iberian languages]] branch of the [[Romance language]], and it has special ties with the following members of this group:
Portuguese and other Romance languages (namely [[French language]] and [[Italian language]]) share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar.
However, Portuguese and [[Galician language]] are fully mutually intelligible.
Spanish is relatively intelligible for lusophones, owing to their geographic proximity and history as [[West Iberian languages]] ([[Ibero-Romance languages]]), historical contact between speakers and mutual influence, shared [[Areal features]] as well as modern lexical, structural, and grammatical similarity (over 85%) between them.[101][102][103][104][105] Many young Portuguese speakers however, will often choose [[English language]] as the lingua-franca of choice, with Spanish, French, Italian, other Europeans, and speakers of other languages.
[[Portuñol]]/Portunhol, a form of [[Code-switching]], has a lively use and is mentioned in popular culture in South America.
Said code-switching is not to be confused with the Portuñol spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay (dialeto do pampa) and Paraguay (dialeto dos [[Brasiguayos]]), and of Portugal with Spain ([[Barranquenho]]), that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people, which have been heavily influenced by Spanish.[108]
The closest relative of Portuguese is Galician, which is spoken in the autonomous community and historical nationality of Galicia ([[Spain]]).
The two were part of a common dialect continuum during the Middle Ages, known today as [[Galician–Portuguese]], but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of [[County of Portugal]] from [[Kingdom of Galicia]].
There is, however, still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as galego-português baixo-limiao, which is spoken in several Galician and Portuguese villages within the transboundary biosphere reserve of [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]]-[[Baixa Limia – Serra do Xurés]].
It is "considered a rarity, a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from [[Cantabria]] to [[Mondego River]] [...]".[109]
As reported by [[UNESCO]], due to the pressure of Spanish on the standard official version of Galician and centuries-old [[Hispanization]], the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing.[109]
Within the EU, Galician, while not being a [[European Parliament]] official language, can be used and is in fact used by some European Parliament constituents due to its similarity with Portuguese.[111][112] Galician like Portuguese, uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect.
Mutual intelligibility estimated at 85% is excellent between Galicians and Portuguese.[113] Despite political efforts in Spain to define them as separate languages, many linguists consider [[Galician language]] and Portuguese to be co-dialects of the same language with regional variations.[114][112]
Another member of the Galician–Portuguese group, most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect, is spoken in the [[Galician-Asturian]] region in a western strip in [[Asturias]] and the westernmost parts of the provinces of [[Province of León]] and [[Province of Zamora]], along the frontier with Galicia, between the [[Eo (river)]] and [[Navia (river)]] rivers (or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers).
The Fala language, known by its speakers as xalimés, mañegu, a fala de Xálima and chapurráu and in Portuguese as a fala de Xálima, a fala da Estremadura, o galego da Estremadura, valego or galaico-estremenho, is another descendant of Galician–Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of [[Valverde del Fresno]] (Valverdi du Fresnu), [[Eljas]] (As Ellas) and [[San Martín de Trevejo]] (Sa Martín de Trevellu) in the autonomous community of [[Extremadura]], near the border with Portugal.
There are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician–Portuguese group, such as [[La Alamedilla]], [[Cedillo]] (Cedilho), [[Herrera de Alcántara]] (Ferreira d'Alcântara) and [[Olivenza]] (Olivença), but in these municipalities, what is spoken is actually Portuguese, not disputed as such in the mainstream.
The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of [[Fernão de Oliveira]], in the Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa, (1536), where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira, Alentejo, Estremadura, and Entre Douro e Minho, all speak differently from each other.
Portuguese has provided [[Loanword]] to many languages, such as [[Indonesian language]], [[Manado Malay]], [[Malayalam]], [[Sri Lanka Tamils (native)]] and [[Sinhala language]], [[Malay language]], [[Bengali language]], [[English (language)]], [[Hindi]], [[Swahili language]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Konkani language]], [[Marathi language]], [[Punjabi language]], [[Tetum language]], [[Tsonga language]], [[Japanese language]], [[Lanc-Patuá creole]], [[Esan people#Language]], [[Bandar Abbas]] (spoken in Iran) and [[Sranan Tongo]] (spoken in Suriname).
It left a strong influence on the [[Old Tupi]], a [[Tupi–Guarani language]], which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around [[Sikka Regency]] in [[Flores]] Island, [[Indonesia]].
In nearby [[Larantuka]], Portuguese is used for prayers in [[Holy Week]] rituals.
The Japanese–Portuguese dictionary [[Nippo Jisho]] (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of [[Society of Jesus]] missionary activity in Japan.
Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the [[Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum]] (Annamite–Portuguese–Latin dictionary) of [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1651) introduced the modern [[Vietnamese alphabet]], which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese.
The [[Romanization]] of [[Chinese language]] was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding [[List of common Chinese surnames]]; one example is Mei.
During 1583–88 Italian Jesuits [[Michele Ruggieri]] and [[Matteo Ricci]] created a Portuguese–Chinese dictionary – the first ever European–Chinese dictionary.[117][118]
For instance, as [[Portuguese Empire]] were presumably the first to introduce the [[Sweet orange]] in Europe, in several modern [[Indo-European languages]] the fruit has been named after them.
Some examples are Albanian portokall, Bosnian (archaic) portokal, prtokal, Bulgarian портокал (portokal), Greek πορτοκάλι (portokáli), [[Macedonian language]] portokal, Persian پرتقال (porteghal), and Romanian portocală.[119][120] Related names can be found in other languages, such as Arabic البرتقال (burtuqāl), [[Georgian language]] ფორთოხალი (p'ort'oxali), Turkish portakal and [[Amharic]] birtukan.[119] Also, in southern [[Italian language]] (e.g. [[Neapolitan language]]), an orange is portogallo or purtuallo, literally "(the) Portuguese (one)", in contrast to [[Standard Italian]] arancia.
Beginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African and Asian slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many [[Pidgin]] with varying amounts of Portuguese influence.
As each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged [[Creole language]], which remained in use in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America until the 18th century.
Some Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, namely [[Cape Verdean Creole]] and [[Papiamento]].
Portuguese-based creoles are spoken by over three million people worldwide, especially people of partial [[Portuguese people]] ancestry.
Portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as [[Franco-Provençal language]] and [[Catalan phonology]], whereas [[Spanish phonology]] is similar to those of [[Sardinian language]] and the [[Neapolitan language]].
Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of [[Spanish language]], [[Gallo-Romance languages]] (e.g. [[French language]]) and the [[Gallo-Italic languages]] (especially [[Genoese dialect]]).[121][10]
Portuguese can have as many as nine oral vowels, as many as two semivowels, and as many as 21 consonants; some varieties of the language have fewer [[Phoneme]].
There are also five [[Nasal vowel]], which some linguists regard as [[Allophone]] of oral vowels.[citation needed] Galician–Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of [[Gallaecia]], from the [[Vulgar Latin]] (common Latin) that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].
[[Gallaecian language]] and [[Lusitanian language]] influences were absorbed into the local dialect of Vulgar Latin; this can be detected in some Galician–Portuguese words, as well as in placenames of [[Celtic language]] and [[Iberians]] origin.[124][125]
An early form of Galician–Portuguese was already spoken in the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]], and by the year 800 Galician–Portuguese had already become the [[Vernacular]] of northwestern Iberia.[126] The first known [[Phonetic]] changes in Vulgar Latin, which began the evolution to Galician–Portuguese, took place during the rule of the Germanic groups, the [[Suebi]] (411–585) and [[Visigoths]] (585–711).[126] The Galician–Portuguese "inflected infinitive" (or "personal infinitive")[127][128] and the [[Nasal vowels]] may have evolved under the influence of local [[Celtic languages]] (as in [[Old French]]).[12][129] The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman [[Gallaecia]], but they are not attested in writing until after the 6th and 7th centuries.[130]
Like [[Catalan language]] and [[German language]], Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables.
Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be [[Vowel height]] and sometimes centralized.
[[Portuguese orthography]] is based on the [[Latin alphabet]] and makes use of the [[Acute accent]], the [[Circumflex accent]], the [[Grave accent]], the [[Tilde]], and the [[Cedilla]] to denote stress, [[Vowel height]], nasalization, and other sound changes.
The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)]] was abolished by the last [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990]].
Accented letters and digraphs are not counted as separate characters for [[Collation]] purposes.
Morphologically, more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major [[Romance language]].
Nevertheless, because of its original [[Lusitanians]] and Celtic [[Gallaeci]] heritage, and the later participation of Portugal in the [[Age of Discovery]], it has a relevant number of words from the ancient [[Hispano-Celtic languages]][11] and adopted [[Loanword]] from other languages around the world.
A number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]], which included the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]].
Most of these words derived from the Hispano-Celtic [[Gallaecian language]] of northwestern Iberia, and are very often shared with [[Galician language]] since both languages have the same origin in the medieval language of Galician–Portuguese.
A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other [[Celtic languages]] sources, often [[Gaulish]].
In the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman [[Hispania]]) was conquered by the [[Germanic peoples]], [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]].
As they adopted the [[Ancient Rome]] civilization and language, however, these people contributed with some 500 
[[Germanic languages]] words to the lexicon.
The [[Germanic languages]] influence also exists in [[Toponymic surname]] and [[Patronymic surname]] borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such as [[Ermesinde]], [[Esposende]] and [[Resende, Portugal]] where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic sinths ('military expedition') and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic reths ('council').
Other examples of Portuguese names, surnames and town names of Germanic [[Toponymic]] origin include Henrique, [[Henriques (surname)]], Vermoim, Mandim, Calquim, Baguim, Gemunde, Guetim, Sermonde and many more, are quite common mainly in the old [[Suebi]] and later [[Visigothic]] dominated regions, covering today's Northern half of Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)]].
Between the 9th and early 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired some 400 to 600 words from [[Arabic language]] by influence of [[Al-Andalus]].
They are often recognizable by the initial [[Definite article in Arabic]], and include common words such as aldeia ('village') from الضيعة aḍ-ḍayʿa, alface ('lettuce') from الخسة al-khassa, armazém ('warehouse') from المخزن al-makhzan, and azeite ('olive oil') from الزيت az-zayt.
For instance, catana ('[[Cutlass]]') from [[Japanese language]] [[Katana]], chá ('tea') from [[Chinese language]] [[Tea#Etymology]], and [[Canja de galinha]][149] ('chicken-soup, piece of cake') from [[Malay language]].
From the 16th to the 19th centuries, because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese acquired several words of African and [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil]] origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories.
From [[Kimbundu language]], for example, came kifumate > cafuné ('head caress') (Brazil), kusula > caçula ('youngest child') (Brazil), marimbondo ('tropical wasp') (Brazil), and kubungula > bungular ('to dance like a wizard') (Angola).
From South America came batata ('[[Potato]]'), from [[Taíno language]]; ananás and abacaxi, from [[Tupi–Guarani languages]] naná and [[Tupi language]] ibá cati, respectively (two species of [[Pineapple]]), and pipoca ('[[Popcorn]]') from Tupi and tucano ('[[Toucan]]') from [[Guarani language]] tucan.
Finally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages, especially French and [[English language]].
Modern Standard [[European Portuguese]] (português padrão[150] or português continental) is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]], in central Portugal.
See [[Portuguese in Africa]].
In a few Brazilian states such as [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Pará, among others, você is virtually absent from the spoken language.
Differences between dialects are mostly of [[Accent (dialect)]] and [[Vocabulary]], but between the Brazilian dialects and other dialects, especially in their most colloquial forms, there can also be some grammatical differences.
The [[Portuguese creole]] spoken in various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas are independent languages.
Portuguese, like [[Catalan language]], preserves the stressed vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]] which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages; cf.
Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of intervocalic l and n, sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an [[Epenthesis]] between them: cf.
When the [[Elision]] consonant was n, it often [[Nasalization]] the preceding vowel: cf.
This also occurs in the minority Swiss [[Romansh language]] language in many equivalent words such as maun ("hand"), bun ("good"), or chaun ("dog").[176]
The Portuguese language is the only [[Romance language]] that preserves the clitic case [[Mesoclisis]]: cf.
Like [[Galician language]], it also retains the Latin synthetic [[Pluperfect]] tense: eu estivera (I had been), eu vivera (I had lived), vós vivêreis (you had lived).[177] [[Romanian language]] also has this tense, but uses the -s- form.
