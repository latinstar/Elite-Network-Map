The present Constitution of the [[Albania]] ([[Albanian language]]: Kushtetuta e Republikës së Shqipërisë) was adopted by the [[Parliament of Albania]] on 21 October 1998 and certified by presidential decree on 28 November 1998, following a public referendum which approved the new Constitution.[1][2] It is split up over many different acts.
The document succeeded the [[Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], originally adopted at the creation of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] on 28 December 1976 and heavily amended on 29 April 1991.[3]
The present Constitution defines [[Albania]] as a [[Unitary state]] [[Parliamentary system]] constitutional republic.[4] It has a [[Unicameral legislature]] composed of 140 [[Legislator]], who elect the [[President of Albania]] as the [[Head of state]], the [[Council of Ministers of Albania]], which consists of the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] as the [[Head of government]], [[Deputy Prime Minister of Albania]] and all other [[Minister (Albania)]].[5]
The modern state was initially constituted as a [[Monarchy]] in 1913, briefly a [[Republic]] in the 1920s, then it returned to a [[Democratic Monarchy]] in 1928.
It later became a [[Socialist state]] until [[Capitalism]] took over in the 1990s.
[[Albanians]] have an old tradition for law and regulations.
Among the old laws is the [[Kanuni i Lek Dukagjinit]], a sort of constitution respected by majority of Albanians throughout centuries.
The [[Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini]], which according to some writings was codified in the 14th century, is distinguished among several Kanuns.
During the [[Albanian National Awakening]] of the 19th century, Albanians founded the [[League of Prizren]] and in the meantime [[Provisional Government of Albania]] for the [[Albanian language]] territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]].
The "New [[Kanun (Albania)]]" was adopted as a program and statute for the governing bodies.
In 1913, the [[Principality of Albania]] was recognized as an independent country, yet the [[International relations (1814–1919)]] decided to restrict Albania's territorial ambitions and imposed a [[Constitutional monarchy]] to be headed by the German prince [[William of Albania]] and his heirs in [[Primogeniture]].
The Organic Statute of Albania ([[Albanian language]]: Statuti Organik i Shqipërisë)[8]—the constitution established by the [[International Control Commission (Albania)]] in 1914—did not have much effect partially due to the rebellions against the foreign king and partially due to World War I.
The 1913 borders arranged by European powers left more than half of the [[Albanian language]] territories outside [[Albania]] borders.
However, right after the [[First World War]], the nation was in danger of being re-partitioned between other countries.
In opposition to this, the Albanian leaders held [[Congress of Lushnjë]] at which they decided to defend the sovereignty of their country and fight against any foreign invasions.
Three years later, in 1928, Albania was proclaimed a kingdom, and President Zogu became [[Zog I of Albania]].
With the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] in 1939, this Constitution was abolished.
Fascist collaborators in Albania offered the throne to [[Victor Emmanuel III]], King of Italy, an act that heavily violated the [[Fundamental Statute of the Kingdom of Albania (1928)]].
The Quisling government established by the Italians passed a [[Fundamental Statute of the Kingdom of Albania (1939)]] in 1939.[11]
After the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)]] of Albania from Nazi occupation, the communists established the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]].
On 11 January 1946, the [[Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] of the People's Republic of Albania was promulgated, to which amendments were adopted in 1950.
2), and in a similar manner to its predecessor entrenched the rule of the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] as the leading force in the Albanian society and "the vanguard of the working class" (Art.
The [[Enver Hoxha]] was [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces and Chairmen of the Defense Council (Art.
The current Constitution was ratified by a [[1998 Albanian constitutional referendum]].[13]
