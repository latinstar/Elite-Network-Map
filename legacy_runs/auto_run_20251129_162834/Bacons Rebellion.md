Bacon's Rebellion was an armed rebellion by [[Colony of Virginia]] [[Settler]] that took place from 1676 to 1677.
It was led by [[Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia colonist)]] against [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]] [[William Berkeley (governor)]], after Berkeley refused Bacon's request to drive Native American Indians out of Virginia.[5] Thousands of Virginians from all [[Social class in the United States]] (including those in [[Indentured servitude in British America]] and slavery) and [[Race and ethnicity in the United States]] rose up in arms against Berkeley, chasing him from [[Jamestown, Virginia]] and ultimately torching the settlement.
The rebellion was first suppressed by a few armed merchant ships from London whose captains sided with Berkeley and the [[Loyalism]].[6]
Government forces led by [[Herbert Jeffreys (English Army officer)]] arrived soon after and spent several years defeating pockets of resistance and reforming the colonial government to be once more under direct Crown control.[7] While the rebellion did not succeed in the initial goal of driving the Native Americans from Virginia, it did result in Berkeley being recalled to England, where he died shortly thereafter.
Bacon's rebellion was the first rebellion in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in which discontented frontiersmen took part.
A [[Protestant Revolution (Maryland)]] in [[History of Maryland]] involving [[John Coode (Governor of Maryland)]] and [[Josias Fendall]] took place in 1689.
The alliance between [[Indentured servitude in British America]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa]] (a mix of indentured, enslaved, and [[Free Negro]]) disturbed the colonial upper class.
They responded by hardening the racial caste of slavery in an attempt to divide the two races from subsequent united uprisings with the passage of the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]].[8][5][9]
In Virginia's [[Northern Neck]] (a relatively undeveloped area in the watersheds of the [[Rappahannock River]] and [[Potomac River]] between cleared and farmed land in southeastern Virginia and cleared and farmed land in eastern Maryland), rather than rent farmland from their former employers, freed indentured servants and other European immigrants began clearing and squatting on land that [[The Crown]] had reserved for Native Americans since 1634.[10] However, with the [[Stuart Restoration]] following the [[English Civil War]], fewer people chose to emigrate from England to flee that internal conflict.
Between the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] and the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the Crown adopted [[Navigation Acts]], in particular a new rule that tobacco grown in the colonies could be sold only to English merchants and shipped to England on English ships.
Virginia's governor, [[William Berkeley (governor)]], had taken office and sailed to the colony shortly before the English Civil War began, and remained in office or with significant power for about 35 years.
Berkeley had traveled back to England to fight (unsuccessfully) for King Charles before returning to the colony in 1645 after [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#Second Anglo-Powhatan War]].
He led military forces which captured the chief [[Opechancanough]] and suppressed the revolt.
Like King Charles, Berkeley refused to call for legislative elections for more than a decade during the English Civil Wars (during part of which Puritan-leaning [[Richard Bennett (governor)]], [[Edward Digges]] and [[Samuel Mathews (colonial Virginia governor)]] had replaced him as the colony's chief executive during the "Long Assembly").
He also issued large land grants to favorites (of 2,000, 10,000 or even 30,000 acres) and was extremely wealthy compared to small planters (owning [[Green Spring Plantation]] outside Jamestown, as well as 5 houses in the colonial capital which he mostly rented out, 400 cattle and 60 horses, as well as several hundred sheep, valuable household silver and nearly a thousand pounds sterling worth of grain in storage).[12] Berkeley's favorites often commanded the local militia in various counties, as well as charging [[Quitrent]] to smaller farmers who cleared and farmed the land on their vast estates.
Nonetheless, after the Restoration of the monarchy, the king granted English-based favorites the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] and the right to 11 years' worth of quitrents in arrears (which seemed like additional taxes).
Meanwhile, [[Susquehannock]] peoples from Pennsylvania and northern Maryland had been displaced by the peoples aligned with the [[Iroquois Confederation]] and moved south into Maryland (where they were initially welcomed) and Virginia.
[[Powhatan#Tribes of the paramount chiefdom and their territories]], [[Doeg people]], [[Patawomeck]] and [[Rappahannock people]] natives began moving into the Northern Neck region as they were displaced from Maryland as well as rapidly settling areas of eastern Virginia, and joined local tribes in defending their land and resources.
In June 1666, Governor Berkeley told General Robert Smith of Rappahanock County that Native Americans in the colony's northern part could be destroyed, in order to provide a "great Terror and Example and Instruction to all other Indians", and that an expedition against them could be funded by enslaving the women and children and selling them outside the colony.[16] Allowing enslavement of Indians for damages done to frontiersman had been permitted by the General Assembly in the case of John Powell of Northumberland County.[17] Thus, soon colonists declared war on the nearby natives.[citation needed] By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the [[Potomac River]] as far north as [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]] (now Theodore Roosevelt Island in [[Washington, D.C.]]).
By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland, apart from those living beside the [[Nanzatico]]/Portobago in [[Caroline County, Virginia]].
Bacon's rebellion was motivated by both [[Class conflict]] and [[Ethnic conflict]] conflict.
In July 1675, [[Doeg Indians]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia]], killed two settlers and destroyed fields of corn and cattle.
Meanwhile, another militia, led by Colonel [[George Mason I]] and Captain [[George Brent (politician)]], attacked a nearby cabin of the friendly [[Susquehannock]] tribe and killed 14 of them.
On August 31, Virginia Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)]] proclaimed that the Susquehannock had been involved in the Stafford County attack with the Doeg.
On September 26, 1,000 members of Maryland militia led by Major [[Thomas Trueman (burgess)]] marched to the Susquehannock stronghold in Maryland.
[[John Washington]] and Col.
[[Isaac Allerton Jr.]] Trueman invited five Susquehannock chiefs to a parley.
Other tribes joined in, killing settlers, burning houses and fields and slaughtering livestock as far south as the [[James River]] and [[York River (Virginia)]].[2]
After raids in Virginia in February 1676, Berkeley initially called up the Virginia militia under Sir [[Henry Chicheley]] and Col.
Bacon later attributed these actions to Berkeley's desire not to impede the beaver fur trade, but historians also note that militia were often unwilling to distinguish between friendly and unfriendly natives.[22] Upset at Governor Berkeley's refusal to retaliate against the Native Americans' raids, farmers in [[Charles City County, Virginia]] gathered near [[Merchant's Hope]] on the James River, the scene of a massacre in [[Indian massacre of 1622]] upon hearing rumors of a new raiding party.[23][24] Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader.[citation needed]
Against Berkeley's previous order, and as Bacon sought a commission to go and attack Indians, his armed militiamen crossed the Chickahominy River into [[New Kent County, Virginia]] nominally seeking the Susquehannock warriors responsible for recent raids and so traveled first toward the [[Pamunkey]] lands, only to find the people had fled into [[Dragon Swamp]].
They then continued westward toward the [[Great Indian Warpath]], a travel and trading path along the [[Appalachian Mountains]].
Governor Berkeley was furious that Bacon's militia had driven the Pamunkeys into hiding and declared the action illegal and rebellious, notwithstanding Bacon's letter ordering payment of money he owed the governor and reiterating that he had no evil intentions against the government nor him.[25] However, not finding Susquehannocks, Bacon's militiamen turned their back upon settlements and struck south until they came to the [[Roanoke River]] and the [[Occaneechi]] people in May.
After convincing Occaneechi warriors (and their [[Monacan people]] and Annalecton[26] allies) to leave their villages and attack the Susquehannock to the west, Bacon and his men refused to pay for those services but instead demanded provisions and beaver pelts.
Not receiving them, they murdered the Occaneechi chief and most of the Occaneechi men, women, and children, which ranged from 100 to 400 people, remaining at the villages, then plundered their larders before proceeding eastward back toward Jamestown.[3] Meanwhile, Berkeley had gathered about 300 men and led them to the falls of the James River (modern day [[Richmond, Virginia]]), but too late to intercept Bacon's forces.
Lady Berkeley declared that Bacon owed his trading partner [[William Byrd I]] 400 pounds sterling and his cousin Nathaniel Bacon Sr. 200 pounds sterling and that his own father had refused to honor his bills of exchange.[27]
Upon returning to their lands in [[Henrico County, Virginia]], Bacon's faction discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the [[House of Burgesses]] to better address the Native American raids and other matters.
[[James Crews]] to represent them in the House of Burgesses.[28][29] However, when Bacon and 40 of his armed followers attempted to dock their sloop at Jamestown, they were fired on by the fort, and so disembarked under cover of darkness to consult with followers [[Richard Lawrence (burgess)]] and [[William Drummond (colonial governor)]] at a tavern.
Berkeley first insisted upon the legislature taking care of Indian business, but a debate as to whether the House would ask for two Councillors to sit with the committee on Indian Affairs never came to a vote, and the Queen of the Pamunkeys demanded compensation for the former war in which her husband had been killed assisting the English as a precondition to furnishing warriors in this conflict, although ultimately the burgesses authorized an army of 1000 men.[31] The recomposed House of Burgesses ultimately enacted a number of sweeping reforms, known as [[Bacon's Laws]] discussed below.
However, by this time Bacon had escaped Jamestown, telling Berkeley that his own wife was ill, but soon placing himself at the head of a volunteer army in [[Henrico County, Virginia]], where natives had renewed raids and killed 8 settlers, including wiping out families.[4][32]
When the burgesses invited Bacon into their Long Room, the governor yielded and signed the military commissions, as well as wrote the King justifying Bacon's conduct.[34] The assembly in Bacon's absence had also rushed through "Bacon's Laws", possibly drafted by Lawrence and Drummond, or by Thomas Blayton (whom [[Edward Hill (Virginian politician)]] later called "Bacon's great engine" in the assembly).
Bacon addressed seven hundred gathered horse and six hundred gathered foot troops, took the oath of allegiance and expected to march the next day, only to learn that Philip Ludwell and Robert Beverley were recruiting other troops on behalf of Governor Berkeley in Gloucester County to their rear, alleging that Bacon's commission was illegal because it had been procured by force, but the troops refused to gather for the governor upon learning they were to oppose the popular hero Bacon.[37] On July 30, 1676, Bacon and his army issued the "[[Declaration of the People]]".[38] The declaration criticized Berkeley's administration in detail.
Berkeley then followed Robert Beverley's advice and fled across Chesapeake Bay to [[Accomack County, Virginia]] on [[Virginia's Eastern Shore]].
Bacon and his followers established a camp at Middle Plantation (modern [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]) and issued a proclamation declaring Berkeley, Chicheley, Ludwell, Beverley and others traitors, as well as threatened to confiscate their estates unless they surrendered within four days.
Among the oath's signers were burgesses or councillors [[Thomas Swann (councillor)]], John Page, Philip Lightfoot and [[Thomas Ballard]].[40] Meanwhile, Bacon's father, Thomas Bacon, was pleading with the King to pardon his son, presenting "The Virginians' Plea".[41]
Bacon then led his army through upper Gloucester and [[Middlesex County, Virginia]] against the Pamunkey, finding a village in the swamps and capturing 45 prisoners (although the queen of the Pamunkeys escaped) as well as stores of wampum, skins, fur and English goods.
Meanwhile, on August 1, Bacon's followers Giles Bland and [[William Carver (burgess)]] captured a ship Rebecca commanded by Captain Larrimore and refitted her with guns, although two other ships escaped.
After Bacon's followers torched the capital and left their encampment at Berkeley's [[Green Spring Plantation]] outside Jamestown, the main body traveled east to [[Yorktown, Virginia]].
They then crossed the York River and encamped in Gloucester County at [[Warner Hall]], home of the speaker of the House of Burgesses, [[Augustine Warner Jr.]][45] However, the Gloucester troops balked at further oaths.
Bacon made his final headquarters at the house of Major [[Thomas Pate (burgess)]], in Gloucester County a few miles east of [[West Point, Virginia]], but fell ill of [[Dysentery]] and after calling in Rev.
Bacon and his rebels never encountered a Crown force consisting of 1,000 [[English Army]] troops led by Colonel [[Herbert Jeffreys (English Army officer)]] transported by a [[Royal Navy]] squadron under the command of [[Thomas Larimore]][49] sent to aid Berkeley.[50][51] Neither Lawrence nor Drummond had military experience, and Giles Bland who had such experience was already Berkeley's prisoner, having been captured along with Carver during the failed kidnapping attempt.
Thus, the remaining rebels elected [[John Ingram (member of Bacon's Rebellion)]], Bacon's second in command but a saddler by trade, as their leader.
Ingram kept his main force at the head of the York River, with small garrisons at strategic points—including Governor Berkeley's residence at Green Spring and Major Arthur Allen's across the James River (at what came to be called [[Bacon's Castle]] though Bacon had never lived there), as well as Colonel West's house near West Point, Councillor Bacon's house at King's Creek and Yorktown (both on the York River) as well as Col.
Berkeley launched a series of successful amphibious attacks across the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and defeated the small pockets of insurgents spread across [[Tidewater (geographic term)]].
[[Thomas Grantham (merchant)]], captain of the ship Concord cruised the [[York River (Virginia)]],[55] despite pleas from Lawrence about the people having been grievously oppressed and requests to remain neutral.[56] Grantham tried to persuade Berkeley to use meekness, which Berkeley soon used to good effect, but insisted that the pardons not be allowed to Lawrence and Drummond.
Farloe produced his military commission and was told that it authorized fighting only against Indians, not the Governor, and so was also executed, as were [[William Carver (burgess)]], Wilford, and John Johnson.[62]
The 71-year-old governor Berkeley returned to the burned capital and his looted Green Spring home at the end of January 1677.[63] His wife described their [[Green Spring Plantation]] in a letter to her cousin:
It looked like one of those the boys pull down at [[Shrovetide]], and was almost as much to repair as if it had been new to build, and no sign that ever there had been a fence around it...[64]
Then [[William Drummond (colonial governor)]] and John Baptista (the latter not mentioned by Berkeley) were tried at Middle Plantation (Williamsburg) not far from Green Spring and executed on January 20.
[[James Crewes]], William Cookson and John Digbie ("Darby" being named as a former servant in Berkeley's list)[61] were tried at Jamestown and hanged on January 24.[65]
Berkeley in particular grew displeased with his former King's Counsel, [[William Sherwood (burgess)]] for defending former rebels.
Meanwhile, after an investigative committee returned its report to [[Charles II of England]], Berkeley was relieved of the governorship and recalled to England.
According to one historian, "Because the tobacco trade generated a crown revenue of about £5–£10 per laboring man, King Charles II wanted no rebellion to distract the colonists from raising the crop."[68] Charles II was reported to have commented, "That old fool has put to death more people in that naked country than I did here for the [[Execution of Charles I]]."[69] No record of the king's comments have been found, and the origin of the story appears to have been colonial legend that arose at least 30 years after the events.
In November 1676,[72] [[Herbert Jeffreys (English Army officer)]] was appointed by Charles II as a lieutenant governor of Virginia colony and arrived in Virginia in February 1677.[73][74] During Bacon's Rebellion, Jeffreys was commander-in-chief of the regiment of six warships carrying over 1,100 troops, tasked with quelling and pacifying the rebellion upon their arrival.[75][76] He served as leader of a three-member commission (alongside [[Sir John Berry]] and [[Francis Moryson]])[77] to inquire into the causes of discontent and political strife in the colony.[78] The commission published a report for the King titled "A True Narrative of the Rise, Progresse, and Cessation of the late Rebellion in Virginia," which provided an official report and history of the insurrection.[79]
As acting governor, Jeffreys was responsible for appeasing the remaining factions of resistance and reforming the colonial government to be once more under direct [[The Crown]] control.[85][86] Jeffreys presided over the [[Treaty of 1677]], the formal peace treaty between the Crown and representatives from various Virginia [[Native Americans in the United States]] tribes that was signed on 28 May 1677.[85][87][88] In October 1677, Jeffreys persuaded the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to pass an act of amnesty for all of the participants in Bacon's Rebellion,[89] and levied fines against any citizen of the colony that called another a "traitor" or "rebel."[90] Jeffreys led efforts to rebuild and restore the state house and colonial capital of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] which had been burned and looted during the rebellion.[91]
Taylor writes, "To give servants greater hope for the future, in 1705 the assembly revived the [[Headright system]] by promising each freedman fifty acres of land, a promise that obliged the government to continue taking land from the Indians."[92]
Bacon promised his army tax breaks, predetermined wages, and freedom from [[Indenture]], "so long as they should serve under his colors."[93] [[Indentured servants]] both black and white had joined the frontier rebellion.
Historians believe the rebellion hastened the hardening of racial lines associated with slavery, as a way for planters and the colony to control some of the poor.[94] For example, historian [[Eric Foner]] writes, "The fear of civil war among whites frightened Virginia's ruling elite, who took steps to consolidate power and improve their image: for example, restoration of property qualifications for voting, reducing taxes, and adoption of a more aggressive American Indian policy."[8] Some of these measures, by appeasing the poor white population, may have had the purpose of inhibiting any future unification with the enslaved black population.
In 1676, [[Ann Cotton (colonial Virginian)]] wrote a personal account of Bacon's Rebellion, written in the form of a letter.
It was published much later in its original form, in 1804, in the [[Richmond Enquirer]] under the title, An account of our late troubles in Virginia.[95] The following year, the same paper published The Beginning, Progress, and Conclusion of Bacon's Rebellion, which former participant [[Thomas Mathew (burgess)]] wrote in 1704 (the year before his death), and which had been acquired for President [[Thomas Jefferson]], who gave his former mentor [[George Wythe]] permission to have it published.[96]
Historians question whether the rebellion by Bacon against Berkeley in 1676 had any lasting significance for the more-successful [[American Revolution]] a century later.
The most idolizing portrait of Bacon is found in Torchbearer of the Revolution (1940) by [[Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker]], which one scholar in 2011 called "one of the worst books on Virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published."[97] The central area of debate is Bacon's controversial character and complex disposition, as illustrated by [[Wilcomb E.
Wesley Frank Craven in the 1968 publication, The Colonies in Transition, argues that Berkeley's greatest failings took place during the revolt, near the end of his life.[99] [[Bernard Bailyn]] pushed the novel thesis that it was a question of access to resources, a failure to fully transplant Old World society to New.[100]
Morgan]]'s 1975 classic, [[American Slavery, American Freedom]], connected the calamity of Bacon's Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony's transition over to slavery, saying, "But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion.
In this telling, the climax of Bacon's Rebellion comes with the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688/89.[102]
According to the [[Historic Jamestown]] website, "For many years, historians considered the Virginia Rebellion of 1676 to be the first stirring of revolutionary sentiment in [North] America, which culminated in the American Revolution almost exactly one hundred years later.
Nonetheless, many in the early [[United States]], including [[Thomas Jefferson]], saw Bacon as a patriot and believed that Bacon's Rebellion truly was a prelude to the later [[American Revolution]] against the control of [[The Crown]].[104][105] This understanding of the conflict was reflected in 20th-century commemorations, including a memorial window in [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and a prominent tablet in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] chamber of the [[Virginia State Capitol]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], which recalls Bacon as "A great Patriot Leader of the Virginia People who died while defending their rights October 26, 1676."[104][105][106] Subsequent to the rebellion, the Virginia colonial legislature enacted the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], which created several strict laws upon people of African background.
[[Datura stramonium]] is a [[Deliriant]] plant that was first documented by a Virginian colonist named [[Robert Beverley Jr.]].[107] In his 1705 book on the history of Virginia, Beverley reported that some soldiers, who had been dispatched to Jamestown to quell Bacon's Rebellion, gathered and ate leaves of [[Datura stramonium]] and spent eleven days acting in bizarre and foolish ways before recovering.[108] After recovering from their intoxication, the soldiers claimed to not remember anything from the past 11 days.[107] This led to the plant being known as Jamestown weed, and later jimsonweed.[109]
Although described as a "cooler" by Beverley, effects can mimic [[Schizophrenia]] and [[Dissociative disorders]], explaining why soldiers acted irrationally, or "went crazy" for days.[107]
