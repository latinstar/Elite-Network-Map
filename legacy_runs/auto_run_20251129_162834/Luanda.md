Luanda (/luˈændə/ also /-ˈɑːn-/ Portuguese: [luˈɐ̃dɐ]) is the [[Capital city]] and [[List of cities and towns in Angola]] of [[Angola]].
It is Angola's primary [[Port]], and its major industrial, cultural and urban centre.
Located on Angola's northern Atlantic coast, Luanda is Angola's [[Administrative centre]], its chief seaport, and also the capital of the [[Luanda Province]].
Luanda and its [[Metropolitan area]] is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world and the most populous [[Lusophone]] city outside [[Brazil]].
Among the oldest colonial cities of Africa, Luanda was founded in January 1576 as São Paulo da Assunção de Loanda by Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]], being occasionally called "Leonda" or "St Paul de Leonda" by non-Portuguese sources.
The city served as the centre of the [[Slavery in Angola]] to Brazil before the institution was prohibited.
At the start of the [[Angolan Civil War]] in 1975, most of the white Portuguese left as refugees,[4] principally migrating to Portugal.
This also caused the exacerbation of slums, or [[Musseques]], around Luanda.
Luanda has been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world for expatriates.[8][9] The inhabitants of Luanda are mostly members of the ethnic [[Ambundu]] people.
In recent decades of the 21st century, the number of ethnic [[Bakongo]] and [[Ovimbundu]] have also increased.
Luanda was the main host city for the matches of the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]].
[[Portugal]] explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded Luanda on 25 January 1576[10] as "São Paulo da Assumpção de Loanda".
In 1618, the Portuguese built the fortress called Fortaleza São Pedro da Barra, and they subsequently built two more: [[Fortaleza de São Miguel]] (1634) and [[Fortress of Sao Francisco do Penedo]] (1765–66).
Luanda was Portugal's bridgehead from 1627, except during the [[Dutch Loango-Angola]], from 1640 to 1648, as Fort Aardenburgh.
The city served as the centre of [[Slavery in Angola]] to [[Colonial Brazil]] from c.
This slave trade also involved local merchants and warriors who profited from the trade.[16] During this period, no large scale territorial conquest was intended by the Portuguese; only a few minor settlements were established in the immediate hinterland of Luanda, some on the last stretch of the [[Kwanza River]].
In the 17th century, the [[Imbangala]] became the main rivals of the [[Northern Mbundu people]] in supplying slaves to the Luanda market.
A strong degree of Brazilian influence was noted in Luanda until the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822.
The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abolished in 1836, and in 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.
By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Continental Portugal]], full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) [[Palm oil]] and [[Peanut oil]], wax, [[Copal]], timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and [[Cocoa bean]], among many other products.
Maize, tobacco, [[Jerky]], and [[Cassava]] are also produced locally.
In 1889, Governor [[Hermenegildo Capelo]] opened the gates of an aqueduct which supplied the city with water, a formerly scarce resource, laying the foundation for major growth.
Throughout Portugal's dictatorship, known as the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)]], Luanda grew from a town of 61,208 with 14.6% of those inhabitants being white in 1940, to a wealthy cosmopolitan major city of 475,328 in 1970 with 124,814 Europeans (26.3%) and around 50,000 mixed race inhabitants (10.5%).[19]
Like most of [[Portuguese Angola]], the cosmopolitan[20] city of Luanda was not affected by the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974); economic growth and development in the entire region reached record highs during this period.
By the time of [[Angolan War of Independence]] in 1975, Luanda was a modern city with the majority of its population being African, but also dominated by a strong minority of white Portuguese origin.[citation needed]
After the [[Carnation Revolution]] in Lisbon on April 25, 1974, with the advent of independence and the start of the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), most of the white Portuguese Luandans left as refugees,[4] principally for Portugal, however many travelled over land to [[South Africa]].
The large numbers of skilled technicians among the force of [[Cuba]] soldiers sent in to support the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) government in the Angolan Civil War were able to make a valuable contribution to restoring and maintaining basic services in the city.
In the following years, however, slums called [[Musseques]]—which had existed for decades—began to grow out of proportion and stretched several kilometres beyond Luanda's former city limits as a result of the decades-long civil war, and because of the rise of deep social inequalities due to large-scale migration of civil war refugees from other Angolan regions.
In 2001 the provisional Angolan governments cleared the Boavista slum in [[Luanda Bay]] so that a luxury housing redevelopment was possible.[21] Luanda has since become one of the world's most expensive cities.[22]
Following the [[Luanda Agreement]] in 2002, with the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]] and high economic growth rates fuelled by the wealth provided by the increasing oil and diamond production, major reconstruction started.[23] Luanda has been of major concern because its population had multiplied and had far outgrown the capacity of the city, especially because much of its infrastructure including water, electricity, and roads had become obsolete and degraded.
Luanda has been undergoing major road reconstruction in the 21st century, and new highways are planned to improve connections to [[Cacuaco]], [[Viana, Angola]], [[Samba, Luanda]], and the new airport.[24] Major [[Social housing]] is also being constructed to house those who reside in slums, which dominate the landscape of Luanda.
Until 2011, the former Luanda Province comprised what now forms five [[List of municipalities of Angola]].
In 2011 the Province was enlarged by the addition of two additional municipalities transferred from [[Bengo Province]], namely Icolo e Bengo, and Quiçama.
Two new municipalities have been created within Greater Luanda since 2017: [[Talatona]] and [[Kilamba-Kiaxi]]
The city of Luanda is divided in six urban districts: [[Ingombota]], Angola Quiluanje, Maianga, Rangel, Samba and Sambizanga.
Luanda is the seat of a [[Catholic Church]] archbishop.[28] It is also the location of most of Angola's educational institutions, including the private [[Catholic University of Angola]] and the public [[University of Agostinho Neto]].
It is also the home of the colonial Governor's Palace and the [[Estádio da Cidadela]] (the "Citadel Stadium"), Angola's main stadium, with a total seating capacity of 60,000.[citation needed]
Luanda has a [[Hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: BSh), bordering upon a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates]] (BWh).
The climate is warm to hot but surprisingly dry, owing to the cool [[Benguela Current]], which prevents moisture from easily condensing into rain.
A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[Climate change]] where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Luanda in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Guatemala City]].
The annual temperature would increase by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F), the temperature of the coldest month by 0.4 °C (0.72 °F), and the temperature of the warmest month by 0.1 °C (0.18 °F).[34][35] According to [[Climate Action Tracker]], the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.[36]
Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Luanda is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], Luanda and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by the future [[Sea level rise]].
Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[Marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to 137.5 billion USD in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to USD 187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, USD 206 billion for RCP8.5 and USD 397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.[37] Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.[38]
The inhabitants of Luanda are primarily members of African ethnic groups, mainly [[Northern Mbundu people]], [[Ovimbundu]], and [[Bakongo]].
The official and the most widely used language is [[Portuguese language]], although several [[Bantu languages]] are also used, chiefly [[Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]], and [[Kikongo]].[40]
There is a sizable minority population of [[Europe]] origin, especially [[Portuguese people]] (about 260,000), as well as [[Brazilian people]].
In recent years, mainly since the mid-2000s, immigration from Portugal has increased due to greater opportunities present in Angola's booming economy.[43][44] There is a sprinkling of immigrants from other African countries as well, including a small expatriate [[South Africa]] community.
Over the last decades, a significant [[Chinese people]] community has formed,[45] as has a much smaller [[Vietnamese people]] community.[citation needed]
Among the [[Places of worship]], several are predominantly [[Christianity]] churches and congregations:[40]
The city is home to numerous cultural institutions, including the [[Sindika Dokolo Foundation]].
The city hosts the annual [[Luanda International Jazz Festival]], since 2009, and houses the Clube Náutico da Ilha de Luanda (CNIL), translated as the "Nautical Club of Luanda Island".
Luanda is one of the world's [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees]] cities for resident foreigners.[48] In Mercer's cost of living index, Luanda was ranked as top of the list due to the extremely high costs of goods and security.
Luanda sits above [[Seoul]], [[Geneva]] and [[Shanghai]] in the rankings.
Manufacturing includes [[Convenience food]], [[Drink]], [[Textile]], [[Cement]] and other building materials, [[Plastic]] products, metalware, [[Cigarette]], and shoes/clothes.
[[Petroleum]] (found in nearby off-shore deposits) is refined in the city, although this facility was repeatedly damaged during the [[Angolan Civil War]] of 1975–2002.
Luanda has an excellent natural harbour; the chief exports are [[Coffee]], [[Cotton]], [[Sugar]], [[Diamond]], [[Iron]], and [[Salt]].[51]
Economic growth is largely supported by [[Oil extraction]] activities, although great [[Economic diversification]] is taking place.
Large [[Investment (macroeconomics)]] (domestic and international), along with strong economic growth, has dramatically increased construction of all economic sectors in the city of Luanda.[52] In 2007, the first modern shopping mall in Angola was established in the city at [[Belas Shopping]] mall.[53]
Luanda is the starting point of the [[Luanda railway]] that goes due east to Malanje.
The [[Angolan Civil War]] left the railway non-functional, but the railway has been restored up to [[Dondo, Angola]] and [[Malanje]].[54]
The main airport of Luanda was [[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport]], which is still the largest in the country.
A new [[International airport]], [[Angola International Airport]] was constructed southeast of the city, a few kilometres from [[Viana, Angola]], and was expected to be opened in 2011.[55] However, as the Angolan government did not continue to make the payments due to the Chinese enterprise in charge of the construction, the firm suspended its work in 2010.
The [[Port of Luanda]] serves as the largest [[Port]] of [[Angola]] and is one of the busiest ports in Africa.[58] Major expansion of this port is also taking place.[59] In 2014, a new port is being developed at [[Dande]], about 30 km to the north.
Luanda's roads are in a poor state of repair, but are undergoing an extensive reconstruction process by the government in order to relieve [[Traffic]] congestion in the city.
Major road repairs can be found taking place in nearly every neighbourhood, including a major 6-lane [[Highway]] connected Luanda to [[Viana, Angola]].[60]
Public transit is provided by the suburban services of the [[Luanda Railway]], by the public company [[Transporte Colectivo Urbano de Luanda]], and by a large fleet of privately owned collective taxis as white-blue painted minibuses called Candongueiro.
Candongueiros are usually [[Toyota Hiace]] vans, that are built to carry 12 people, although the candongueiros usually carry at least 15 people.
In 2019, the [[Luanda Light Rail]] network with an estimated cost of [[U.S. dollar]]3 billion was announced to begin construction in 2020.[61]
Luanda's [[Pavilhão Multiusos do Kilamba]] hosted games for [[Angola's national basketball team]] on many occasions.[62]
In 2013 Luanda together with Namibe, today's [[Moçâmedes]], hosted the [[2013 FIRS Men's Roller Hockey World Cup]], the first time that a World Cup of [[Roller hockey (quad)]] was held in Africa.
