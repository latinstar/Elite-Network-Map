Since 2015, Trump's leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as [[Trumpism]]—have reshaped the Republican Party's identity.
Many of his comments and actions have been [[Racial views of Donald Trump]] or misogynistic,  and he has [[False or misleading statements by Donald Trump]] and [[List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump]] to a degree unprecedented in American politics.
Trump's actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to [[Democratic backsliding in the United States]].
After his first term, scholars and historians [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary]] as one of the worst presidents in American history.
Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at [[Jamaica Hospital]] in the New York City borough of [[Queens]], the fourth child of [[Fred Trump]] and [[Mary Anne MacLeod Trump]].[1] He is of German and Scottish descent.[2] He grew up with his older siblings, [[Maryanne Trump Barry]], [[Fred Trump Jr.]], and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, [[Robert Trump]], in a 23-room mansion in the [[Jamaica Estates]] neighborhood of Queens.[3] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024.
Trump attended the private [[Kew-Forest School]] through seventh grade.
His father enrolled him in [[New York Military Academy]], a private boarding school, to complete secondary school.[5] The academy pushed students into sports[6] and taught the imperative of winning.[7] In high school, he earned a [[Grading systems by country#United States]].[8][a]
Trump considered a show business career but instead, to be closer to home, enrolled at [[Fordham University]] in 1964.[10] He participated in the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program during his first year, attending classes in a military uniform every Wednesday, but dropped it in his second year.[11] He dropped football after three or four weeks and was a mediocre squash and tennis player.[12] His Fordham friends introduced him to golf.[13] His junior year, he transferred to the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], most often commuting to his father's office on weekends, and graduating in May 1968 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in economics.[14][15] In college[16] he was not the top student he sometimes claimed to be.[17] By the time he went to Wharton—where he does not appear in a list of those receiving honors[b]—he was eyeing a career in real estate.[16] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of [[Bone spurs]] in his heels.[18] Notwithstanding five years in military school,[16] he had no interest in going to war.[18]
Growing up, he regarded his father and the family's pastor, [[Norman Vincent Peale]],[19] as mentors.[20] His father told him repeatedly that he was "a king" and to be "a killer".[21]
Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at Trump Management, his father's real estate company,[22] which managed the middle-class apartment complexes Fred had built in [[Queens]], [[Staten Island]], and [[Brooklyn]].[23] His main tasks were collecting rent and making repairs[24] for about five years.[25] Captivated by its glamor and riches,[26] Trump asked his father to expand to [[Manhattan]] where prices were higher, but his father was content in the outer boroughs.[25] In 1971, he moved to Manhattan where he planned to move the business[27] and commuted to his father's office.[28] That year, his father made himself chairman and Trump president, overseeing 48 private corporations and 15 family partnerships.[16] Trump began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella for the corporate names of his father's businesses.[29]
[[Roy Cohn]], Trump's most important early influence after his father,[30] was his [[Fixer (person)]], lawyer, and mentor[31] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[32] Cohn taught Trump to think that life is transactional.[33] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024[34]) over its charges that Trump's properties had discriminated against Black applicants and tenants.
Four years later, the Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree.[35] Helping Trump projects,[36] Cohn was a [[Consigliere]] whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.[37] In 1979, Cohn introduced political consultant [[Roger Stone]] to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[38]
Trump moved from his studio to a penthouse with a view and got a real estate broker's license in the mid-1970s.[39] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win.[40] Over three decades as of 2018, Trump had been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits,[41] liens, and other filings, often filed for nonpayment against him by employees, contractors, real estate brokers, and his own attorneys.[42] Between 1991 and 2009, Trump filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the [[Plaza Hotel]] in Manhattan, the casinos in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], and the [[Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts]] company.[43][44]
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict [[Grand Hyatt New York]], adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[47] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with [[Hyatt]], guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[48][49] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the [[Grand Hyatt New York]],[50] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop [[Trump Tower]], a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[51] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's [[Political action committee]] and was his primary residence until 2019.[52] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks.[53] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[54]
In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a "vast and humiliating restructuring" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[55][56] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead".[55] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at [[40 Wall Street]], later rebranded as the Trump Building.[57] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the [[Lincoln Square, Manhattan]] neighborhood near the Hudson River.
Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, [[Riverside South, Manhattan]].[58] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)]] in Chicago, which opened in 2008.
In 2024, [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)#Tax deductions]] that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[59]
In 1984, Trump opened [[Harrah's at Trump Plaza]], a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the [[Holiday Corporation]].[60] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[61] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it [[Trump's Castle]].[62][63] Both casinos filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection in 1992.[64] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the [[Trump Taj Mahal]].
It was financed with $675 million in [[Junk bonds]] and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[60] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991.
Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[65] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the [[Trump Shuttle]] airline; his megayacht, the [[Trump Princess]], which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[66] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[67] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[60] He remained chairman until 2009.[68]
In 1985, Trump acquired the [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[69] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues.
He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[70] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[52] He began [[Donald Trump and golf]] in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016.[71]
In 1970, Trump invested $70,000 of his father's wealth to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy—and lost the money.[75] After making low-ball bids for the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Cleveland Indians]] baseball teams, in 1983 for about $6 million, he purchased the [[New Jersey Generals]], a team in the [[United States Football League]].[76] The league folded after the 1985 season, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the [[National Football League]] for audience) and his attempt to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[77] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the [[Atlantic City Convention Hall]].[60][78] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the [[Tour de Trump]] cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the [[Tour de France]] or the [[Giro d'Italia]].[79]
From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[80] leading some observers to think he was engaged in [[Greenmail]].[81] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".[80]
In 1988, Trump purchased the [[Eastern Air Lines Shuttle]], financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1.01 billion in 2024[34]) in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks.
He renamed the airline [[Trump Shuttle]] and operated it until 1992.[82] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[83] In 1996, he purchased the [[Miss Universe]] pageants, including [[Miss USA]] and [[Miss Teen USA]].[84] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[85][86] In 2007, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[87] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.[88]
In 2005, Trump cofounded [[Trump University]], a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000.
Trump Foundation was a [[Private foundation (United States)]] established in 1988.[92] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million, which had been spent by the end of 2006.
After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[93] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from [[Vince McMahon]].[94] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[95] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[93] In 2016, [[The Washington Post]] reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and [[Tax evasion]].[96] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general stated the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[97] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[98] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[99] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[100] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[101]
According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by [[USA Today]] in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[41] While he has not filed for [[Personal bankruptcy]], his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[44] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[44] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[102] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of [[Deutsche Bank]], declined to lend to him.[103] After the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]], the bank decided not to do business with him or his affiliated company in the future.[104]
Trump has said he began his career with "a small loan of a million dollars" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[105] He borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely did not repay the loans, and received another $413 million (2018 equivalent, adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[106][45] Posing as a Trump Organization official named "[[John Barron (pseudonym)]]", Trump called journalist Jonathan Greenberg in 1984, trying to get a higher ranking on the [[Forbes 400]] list of wealthy Americans.[107] Trump self-reported his net worth over a wide range: from minus $900 million in 1990[108] to $10 billion in 2015.[109] In 2015, [[Forbes]] estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion, based on interviews with more than 80 sources.[110] In 2025, the magazine estimated his net worth at $5.1 billion and ranked him the 700th wealthiest person in the world.[111]
Trump has published 19 books under his name, most written or cowritten by [[Ghostwriters]].[112] His first book, [[The Art of the Deal]] (1987), was a [[The New York Times Best Seller list]], and was credited by [[The New Yorker]] with making Trump famous as an "emblem of the successful tycoon".[113] The book was ghostwritten by [[Tony Schwartz (author)]], who is credited as a coauthor.
Trump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[114] Trump acquired his style of politics from [[Professional wrestling]]—with its [[Staged fight]] and [[Name-calling]].[115] He sporadically appeared for the professional wrestling company [[WWE]] from the late 1980s including [[WrestleMania 23]] in 2007.[116][117] Starting in the 1990s, Trump appeared 24 times as a guest on the nationally syndicated [[Howard Stern Show]].[118] He had his own short-form talk radio program, [[Trumped!]],  from 2004 to 2008.[119] From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator on [[Fox & Friends]].[120] In 2021, Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from [[SAG-AFTRA]] to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack.[121] Two days later, the union permanently barred him.[122]
Producer [[Mark Burnett]] made Trump a television star[123] when he created The Apprentice, which Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015 (including variant The Celebrity Apprentice).
On the shows, he was a superrich chief executive who eliminated contestants with the [[Catchphrase]] "you're fired".
Trump registered as a [[Republican Party (United States)]] in Queens in 1969 and in Manhattan in 1987;[16][127] a member of the [[Independence Party of New York]], the New York state affiliate of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]], in 1999; a [[Democratic Party (United States)]] in 2001; a Republican in 2009; [[Independent politician]] in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[128]
In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in major newspapers[129] expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[130] In 1988, he approached [[Lee Atwater]], asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee [[George H.
Bush found the request "strange and unbelievable".[131][132] Trump [[Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign]] in the [[2000 Reform Party presidential primaries]] for three months before he withdrew in February 2000.[133][134][135] In 2011, Trump considered challenging President [[Barack Obama]] in [[2012 United States presidential election]].
He spoke at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in February and gave speeches in states with early primaries.[136][137] In May 2011, he announced that he would not run.[136]
Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 election in June 2015.[138][139] He campaigned as a rich, successful businessman and an outsider without political experience,[140][141][142] and claimed [[Media bias]] against him.[143][144] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[145] and a record number were false.[146][147][148] He became the Republican front-runner in March 2016[149] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[150]
Trump described NATO as "obsolete"[151][152] and espoused views described by The Washington Post as [[Noninterventionist]] and [[Protectionist]].[153] His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating [[U.S.–China relations]] and free trade agreements such as [[NAFTA]] and strongly enforcing immigration laws.
Other campaign positions included pursuing [[Energy independence]] while opposing climate change regulations, modernizing [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs#Veterans Benefits Administration]], repealing and replacing the [[Affordable Care Act]], abolishing [[Common Core]] education standards, [[Infrastructure-based development]], simplifying the [[Internal Revenue Code]] while reducing taxes, and imposing [[Tariff]] on imports by companies that offshore jobs.
He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.[154] He promised to build a [[Mexico–United States border wall]] and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[155] He pledged to deport millions of [[Undocumented immigrant population of the United States]],[156] and criticized [[Birthright citizenship in the United States]] for incentivizing "[[Anchor babies]]".[157] According to an analysis in [[Political Science Quarterly]], Trump made "explicitly racist and sexist appeals to win over white voters" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[158] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists";[159] in response, NBC fired him from Celebrity Apprentice.[160]
Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[161][162] He did not release [[Donald Trump's tax returns]], contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[163][164] He said his tax returns were being [[Income tax audit]], and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[165] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the [[Manhattan district attorney]] for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[166][167] In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times.
Trump won the election with 306 pledged [[Electoral College (United States)]] versus 232 for Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].
After elector [[Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidential election]], the official count was 304 to 227.[169] The fifth person to be elected president [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote]],[c] he received nearly 2.9 million fewer votes than Clinton, 46.3% to her 48.25%.[170] He was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[171] His election marked the return of a Republican [[Divided government in the United States]].[d][172] Trump's victory [[Protests against Donald Trump#Before first presidency]] in major U.S. cities.[173][174]
[[First inauguration of Donald Trump]] on January 20, 2017.
The day after his inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in Washington, D.C., protested against him in the [[2017 Women's March]].[175] During his first week in office, Trump signed [[List of executive orders in the first Trump presidency]], including authorizing procedures for repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, advancement of the [[Keystone Pipeline]] and [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] projects, and planning for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[176]
Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a [[Revocable trust]],[177][178] rather than a [[Blind trust]] or equivalent arrangement "to cleanly sever himself from his business interests".[179] He continued to profit from his businesses and knew how his administration's policies affected them.[178][180] Although he said he would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization pursued operational expansions in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic.[178][180] Lobbyists, foreign government officials, and Trump donors and allies generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his resorts and hotels.[181] Trump was sued for violating the [[Domestic Emoluments Clause]] and [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]], the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[182] One case was dismissed in lower court.[183] Two were dismissed by the Supreme Court as moot after his term.[184]
Federal agencies surveyed by The Washington Post in July 2021 reported not having received any gifts after that month.[187] [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] reported in 2024 that he had donated $448,000 of an estimated $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments in his first term.[188]
Trump took office at the height of the longest [[Economic expansion]] in American history,[189] which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the [[COVID-19 recession]] began.[190] In December 2017, he signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].
It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and eliminated the penalty associated with the [[Affordable Care Act]]'s individual mandate.[191][192] The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[193] Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[194] By the end of his term, the [[U.S. national debt]] increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion, and the U.S. [[Debt-to-GDP ratio]] hit a post-World War II high.[195] Trump also failed to deliver on his campaign promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan.[196]
He rejects the [[Scientific consensus on climate change]].[197]
He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[198] He [[United States and the Paris Agreement]], making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[199] He aimed to boost the production and exports of [[Fossil fuel]].[200][201] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[202][203] He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed [[Greenhouse gas emissions]], air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances.
He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing [[Arctic Refuge drilling controversy]].[204]
Trump dismantled federal regulations on health,[205][206] labor,[206] the environment,[207][206] and other areas, including a bill that revoked the Obama-era regulation restricting the sale of firearms to severely mentally ill people.[208] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[209] often "after requests by the regulated industries".[210] The [[Institute for Policy Integrity]] found that 78 percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[211] During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the [[Affordable Care Act]].[212] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders.[213][214] He expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration halved the [[Annual enrollment]] and drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[215][216] In June 2018, the Trump administration [[California v.
Texas]] that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[217][218] Their pleading would have eliminated [[Health insurance coverage in the United States]] for up to 23 million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[217] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs.
In response to the [[Opioid epidemic in the United States]], Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy.[220] He barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[221] He said he supported "traditional marriage", but considered the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] of [[Same-sex marriage]] "settled".[222] His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against [[Discrimination against LGBT people]].[223] His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for [[Transgender]] patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees' civil rights protections to [[Gender identity]] and sexual orientation.[224] Trump has said he is [[Gun politics in the United States]] to [[Gun control]], although his views have shifted over time.[225] His administration took an [[Cannabis policy of the Donald Trump administration]], revoking [[Cole Memorandum]] that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[226] He is a long-time advocate of capital punishment,[227][228] and his administration oversaw the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government]] 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[229] In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods "a hell of a lot worse than [[Waterboarding]]".[230][231]
Trump's comments on the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]], condemning "this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides" and stating that there were "very fine people on both sides", were criticized as implying a [[Moral equivalence]] between the [[White supremacist]] demonstrators and the counter-protesters.[232] In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as "shithole countries".[233] His remarks were condemned as racist.[234]
In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should "[[Go back where you came from]]" to the countries they "came from".[235] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his "racist comments".[236] [[White nationalist]] publications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[237] He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[238] In June 2020, during the [[George Floyd protests]], federal law-enforcement officials used tear gas and other crowd control tactics to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters from [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.]], outside the [[White House]].[239][240] Trump then [[Donald Trump photo-op at St. John's Church]] at the nearby [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square]],[239][241][242] with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[243] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[244]
Bush]] and [[George W.
Bush]].[245] Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's [[Office of the Pardon Attorney]]; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[246][247] In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[248] Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[246] The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[249]
As president, Trump described illegal immigration as an "invasion" of the United States[250] and drastically escalated immigration enforcement.[251][252] He implemented harsh policies against asylum seekers[252] and [[Operation Faithful Patriot]] to the [[U.S.–Mexico border]] to stop illegal crossings.[253] He reduced the number of [[United States Refugee Admissions Program]] to record lows, from an annual limit of 110,000 before he took office to 15,000 in 2021.[254][255][256] Trump also increased restrictions on granting [[Permanent residency in the United States]] to [[Public charge rule]].[257] One of his central campaign promises was to build a [[Mexico–United States border wall]];[258] during his first term, the U.S. built 73 miles (117 km) of wall in areas without barriers and 365 miles (587 km) to replace older barriers.[259] In 2018, Trump's refusal to sign any [[Appropriations bill]] unless it allocated funding for the border wall[260] resulted in [[2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown]], for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019.[261][262] The shutdown ended after he agreed to fund the government without any funds for the wall.[261] To avoid another shutdown, Congress passed a funding bill with $1.4 billion for border fencing in February.[263] Trump later declared a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States]] to divert $6.1 billion of funding to the border wall[263] despite congressional disagreement.[264]
In January 2017, Trump signed [[Executive Order 13769]] that [[Trump travel ban]] for four months and from Syria indefinitely.[265][266] The order caused [[Protests against Executive Order 13769]] and [[Legal challenges to the Trump travel ban]] that resulted in [[Nationwide injunction]].[265][266][267] [[Executive Order 13780]] giving some exceptions was also blocked by courts,[268][269] but [[International Refugee Assistance Project v.
Trump]] that the ban could be enforced on those lacking "a bona fide relationship with a person or entity" in the U.S.[270] Trump replaced the ban in September with [[Presidential Proclamation 9645]] extending travel bans to North Koreans, Chadians, and some Venezuelan officials, but excluded Iraq and Sudan.[271] The Supreme Court allowed that version to go into effect in December 2017,[272] and ultimately upheld the ban in 2019.[273]
From 2017 to 2018, the Trump administration had [[Trump administration family separation policy]] that separated over 4,400 children, some as young as four months old,[274] from migrant parents at the U.S.–Mexico border.[275][276] The unprecedented[277] policy sparked public outrage in the country.[278] Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats[279][280] and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that illegal immigrant families be detained together unless "there is a concern" of risk for the child.[281][282] A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances,[283][284] though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.[276] By April 2024, 1,360 children had not been confirmed as reunified with their families.[274]
Trump described himself as a "nationalist"[285] and his foreign policy as "[[America First]]".[286] He supported [[Populist]], [[Neo-nationalist]], and authoritarian governments.[287] Unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency characterized foreign relations during his tenure.[286][288] Relations between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[289] He criticized [[Member states of NATO]] and privately suggested that the U.S. should [[Withdrawal from NATO#United States]].[290][291] Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].[292] In 2020, Trump hosted the signing of the [[Abraham Accords]] between Israel and the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]] to normalize their foreign relations.[293]
Trump began [[China–United States trade war]] in 2018 after imposing tariffs and other trade barriers he said would force China to end longstanding unfair trade practice and [[Allegations of intellectual property infringement by China]].[294] Trump weakened the toughest U.S. sanctions imposed after the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]].[295][296] Trump praised and, according to some critics, rarely criticized Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]],[297][298] though he opposed some actions of Russia's government.[299] He withdrew the U.S. from the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[300] and supported Russia's possible return to the [[G7]].[301] As [[North Korea's nuclear weapons]] were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[302] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, meeting [[Kim Jong Un]] three times: [[2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit]] in June 2018, [[2019 North Korea–United States Hanoi Summit]] in February 2019, and [[2019 Koreas–United States DMZ Summit]] in June 2019.[303] Talks in October 2019 broke down and no [[Denuclearization]] agreement was reached.[304][305]
Trump had four [[White House chiefs of staff]], marginalizing or pushing out several.[312] In May 2017, he [[Dismissal of James Comey]], saying a few days later that he was concerned about Comey's role in the Trump–Russia investigations.[313][314] Three of Trump's 15 original cabinet members left or were forced to resign within his first year.[315][310] Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary.
Trump appointed 226 [[United States federal judge]], including 54 to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and [[Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]].[318] His Supreme Court appointments politically shifted the Court to the right.[319][320][321] In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that [[Roe v.
His attacks on courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the [[Judicial independence]] and public confidence in the judiciary.[324][325]
Trump initially ignored public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration.[326] Trump established the [[White House Coronavirus Task Force]] on January 29.[327] On March 27, he signed into law the [[CARES Act]]—a $2.2 trillion bipartisan [[Economic stimulus]] bill—the largest stimulus in U.S. history.[328][329] After weeks of attacks to draw attention away from his slow response, Trump halted funding of the [[World Health Organization]] in April.[330] In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized [[Protests in the United States over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic]] against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[331][332] Trump encouraged the protests on [[Twitter]],[333] although the targeted states did not meet his administration's guidelines for reopening.[334] He repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[335] such as approving unproven treatments.[336][337] In October, Trump was hospitalized at [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] for three days with a severe case of [[COVID-19]].[338]
After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing [[United States Department of Justice]] and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his [[The Trump Organization]], personal taxes, and [[Donald J.
In July 2016, the [[FBI]] launched [[Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation)]], an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.[341] After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a second investigation into Trump's personal and [[Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia]].[342] In January 2017, three U.S. intelligence agencies jointly stated with "high confidence" that [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] to favor Trump.[343][344] Many suspicious[345] [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials]] were discovered.[346][347][348] Trump told Russian officials he was unconcerned about Russia's election interference.[349] Crossfire Hurricane was later transferred to [[Robert Mueller]]'s [[Mueller special counsel investigation]];[350] the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia was ended by Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] after he told the FBI that Mueller would pursue the matter.[351][352] At the request of Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation examined criminal matters "in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference".[351] Mueller submitted [[Mueller report]] in March 2019.[353] The report found that Russia did interfere in 2016 to favor Trump[354] and that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged the effort,[355][356][357] but that the evidence "did not establish" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia.[358][359] Trump claimed the report exonerated him despite Mueller writing that it did not.[360] The report also detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but "did not draw ultimate conclusions"[361][362] and left the decision to charge the laws to Congress.[363]
In April 2019, the [[House Oversight Committee]] issued [[Subpoena]] seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and [[Capital One]], and his accounting firm, [[Mazars USA]].
He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair [[Elijah Cummings]] to prevent the disclosures.[364] In May, two judges ruled that both Mazars and the banks must comply with the subpoenas;[365][366][367] Trump's attorneys appealed.[368] In September 2022, Trump and the committee agreed to a settlement regarding Mazars, and the firm began turning over documents.[369]
Trump was [[Impeachment in the United States]] twice by the House of Representatives, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions.
The [[First impeachment of Donald Trump]] arose from a whistleblower complaint that in July 2019 Trump [[2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal]] Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden,[370] in an attempt to gain an advantage in the [[2020 United States presidential election]].[371] In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for [[Abuse of power]] and [[Obstruction of Congress]],[372] and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.[373]
The [[Second impeachment of Donald Trump]] came after the January 6 Capitol attack, for which the House charged Trump with [[Incitement of insurrection]] on January 13, 2021.[374] Trump left office on January 20, and was acquitted on February 13.
Trump filed to run for reelection only a few hours after becoming president in 2017.[376] He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[377] and officially became the [[2020 Republican Party presidential primaries]] in August 2020.[378] Trump's campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won.[379] He repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[380][381] and appealed to racism.[382] Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[383][384] He [[2020 United States Postal Service crisis]], saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[385] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a [[Peaceful transition of power]].[386][387]
Joe Biden won the November 2020 election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[388][389] and 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232,[390] with the [[United States Electoral College]] formalizing Biden's victory on December 14.[390] Trump declared victory before the results were known on the morning after the election.[391] Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud.[392] As part of [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election]], Trump and his allies filed many [[Post-election lawsuits related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election]], which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis.[393][394]
Pennsylvania]] in four states won by Biden.[396] Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[397] Republican legislators,[398] the Justice Department,[399] and Vice President Pence,[400] urging actions such as [[Trump fake electors plot]],[398] or that Georgia officials [[Trump–Raffensperger phone call]] a "recalculated" result.[397] In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities.[401] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in [[Presidential transition of Joe Biden]].[402][403] After three weeks, the administrator of the [[General Services Administration]] declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[404] While Trump said he recommended that the GSA begin transition protocols, he still did not formally concede.[405][406] Trump did not attend [[Biden's inauguration]] on January 20.[407]
In December 2020, reports emerged that U.S. military leaders were on high alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared [[Martial law]].[408] CIA director [[Gina Haspel]] and Army general [[Mark Milley]], chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], grew concerned that Trump might attempt a [[Coup]] or military action against China or Iran.[409][410] Milley insisted that he be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[411][412]
At noon on January 6, 2021, while [[2021 United States Electoral College vote count]] in the [[U.S. Capitol]], Trump held [[January 6 Trump rally]].
Speaking from behind a glass barrier,[413] he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to "fight like hell" and "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol.[414] His supporters then [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]], disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[415] During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse.
In a [[Tweet (social media)]] at 6 p.m., he told them to "go home with love & in peace", called them "great patriots", and restated that he had won the election.[416] Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden's victory in the early hours of January 7.[417]
More than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died during or after the attack.[418][419] The event has been described as an attempted [[Self-coup]] by Trump.[e]
Upon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the [[Former Presidents Act]].[423] His continuing [[Big lie#Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election]] were commonly referred to as the "[[Big lie]]" by his critics, although in May 2021, he and many of his supporters began using the term to refer to the election itself.[424][425] The Republican Party used his false claims about the election to justify [[Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election]] in its favor.[426][427][428] He continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election.[429] Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern [[Party boss]].[430] He continued fundraising, raising a [[War chest]] containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago.
Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him.[430] In the [[2022 midterm elections]], he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices.[431] In February 2021, he registered a new company, [[Trump Media & Technology Group]] (TMTG), for providing "social networking services" to U.S. customers.[432][433] In March 2024, TMTG merged with [[Special-purpose acquisition company]] [[Digital World Acquisition Corp.]] and became a [[Public company]].[434] In February 2022, TMTG launched [[Truth Social]], a social media platform.[435]
Jean Carroll]] accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s and [[E.
Trump]] over his denial.[436] Carroll sued him again in 2022 for [[Battery (crime)]] and further defamation.[437] He was [[Legal liability]] for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million in one case[438] and $83.3 million in the other.[439] Federal appeals courts upheld both findings and awards in December 2024 and September 2025, respectively.[440][439]
In 2022, [[New York business fraud lawsuit against the Trump Organization]] against Trump accusing him of inflating the Trump Organization's value to gain an advantage with lenders and banks.[441][442] He was found liable and ordered to pay nearly $355 million plus interest.[442] In August 2025, the appeals court upheld his liability and nonmonetary penalties, but voided the monetary penalty as excessive.[443]
In connection with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the January 6 attack, in December 2022 the [[United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack]] recommended criminal charges against him for [[Obstructing an official proceeding]], [[Conspiracy to defraud the United States]], and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[444] In August 2023, a grand jury in [[Fulton County, Georgia]], indicted him on [[Georgia election racketeering prosecution]], for his efforts to subvert the 2020 election in the state.[445][446] The case was dismissed in November 2025 after the new prosecutor declined to pursue the charges.[447]
In January 2022, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] retrieved 15 boxes of documents Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, some of which were classified.[448] In the ensuing Justice Department investigation, officials retrieved more classified documents from his lawyers.[448] On August 8, 2022, [[FBI search of Mar-a-Lago]] for illegally held documents, including those in breach of the [[Espionage Act]], collecting 11 sets of classified documents, some marked top secret.[449][450] A [[Federal grand jury]] constituted by Special Counsel [[Jack Smith (lawyer)]] indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of "willfully retaining national defense information" under the [[Espionage Act]], among other charges.[448][451][452] Trump pleaded not guilty.[453] In July 2024, judge [[Aileen Cannon]] dismissed [[Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)]], ruling Smith's appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional.[454] After his reelection, the [[Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case)]] and the classified documents case were dismissed [[Prejudice (legal term)#With prejudice and without prejudice]] due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.[455]
In May 2024, Trump [[Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York]] of [[Falsifying business records]].[456] The case stemmed from evidence that he booked [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)]]'s hush-money payments to adult film actress [[Stormy Daniels]] as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006–2007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election.[456][457] On January 10, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity.[458]
In November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and created a fundraising account.[459][460] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting ten percent of the donations to his [[Leadership PAC]].
During the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements.[463]
He said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents[464][465] and use the military to target Democratic politicians and those that did not support his candidacy.[466][467] He used harsher and more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency.[468]
His rhetoric, calling his political opponents "the enemy", vermin, and fascists, has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, [[Donald Trump and fascism]],[469]
and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history.[470][467][471] [[Age and health concerns about Donald Trump]] also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, [[Tangential speech]] and [[Disinhibition]].[472]
On July 13, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in [[Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania]] at a campaign rally in [[Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania]].[475][476][477] Two days later, the [[2024 Republican National Convention]] nominated him as their presidential candidate.[478] In September he was targeted but unharmed in [[Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida]].[479] Trump won the election in November 2024 with 312 electoral votes to incumbent vice president Kamala Harris's 226.[480] He also won the popular vote with 49.8% to Harris's 48.3%.[481] His victory in 2024 was  in large part due to the [[2021–2023 inflation surge]].[482][483] Several outlets described his reelection as an extraordinary comeback.[484][485]
Trump began his second term upon [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump]] on January 20, 2025.[486] He became the [[List of presidents of the United States by age]],[487] the first president with a felony conviction, and the second person to serve two nonconsecutive terms as president.[488] His attempts to expand presidential power and conflict with the courts have been described as a defining characteristic of his second term.[489]
More than a month before the 100-day mark of Trump's second term, he had [[List of executive orders in the second Trump presidency]] than any other U.S. president's first 100 days.[490] Many of these tested his legal authority, and drew immediate legal action.[491] Four days into his second term, analysis conducted by [[Time (magazine)]] found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions "mirror or partially mirror" proposals from [[Project 2025]].[492] In his first weeks, several of his actions ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars.[493][494][495] His orders and actions were challenged by over 300 lawsuits nationwide, with most of them still moving through the courts by July 2.[496][497]
Trump's second presidency was described as having fewer guardrails against conflicts of interest than his first,[498] and breaking with decades of ethical norms.[499] He maintained a publicly traded company in [[Trump Media & Technology Group]], and diversified it into financial services.[500] He pursued new overseas real estate deals involving state-affiliated entities, and had several branding and licensing deals selling Trump-branded merchandise.[498] He profited from events held at his hotels and golf courses and did not place his assets in a blind trust, as previous presidents had done.[501] In August 2025, Trump's mandatory disclosure of investment showed that, since taking office, he had made 690 purchases of municipal bonds and corporate stock totaling at least $103.7 million.
Trump launched, promoted, and personally benefited from [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments]] ("meme coins"), [[$Trump]] and $Melania.[503][504] He also directly benefited from his family's cryptocurrency company [[World Liberty Financial]], which engaged in an unprecedented mixing of private enterprise and government policy.[505]
In July 2025, the Trump administration accepted a [[N7478D]] from Qatar.
The aircraft will serve as [[Air Force One]] until the end of his second term, when it will be transferred to his presidential library.
Trump implemented a hiring freeze across the federal government and ordered telework of federal employees to be discontinued within 30 days.[507][508] He ordered a review of many career civil service positions with the intention of [[Career appointment]] without job protections.[508][509][510] He initiated mass job terminations of federal employees,[511] which were described by legal experts as unprecedented or in violation of federal law,[512] with the intent of replacing them with workers more aligned with his agenda.[513] By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people.[514] To facilitate further terminations, it adopted a novel legal interpretation that vastly expands the range of departments and agencies considered as having national security for their primary function,[515][516][517] declaring various federal workers' unions "hostile".[518][519] A late March executive order based on this interpretation excluded dozens of departments and agencies from [[Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute]], prompting them to sue to invalidate their [[Collective bargaining agreement]],[520][517] which could remove union protections from one million federal employees.[518][521] He ordered an end to [[Diversity, equity, and inclusion]] (DEI) projects in the federal government and rescinded [[Lyndon B.
Johnson]]'s 1965 [[Executive Order 11246]], which had mandated that federal contractors take affirmative action to end racial discrimination.[522][523]
Trump and [[Elon Musk]]'s [[Department of Government Efficiency]] largely dismantled several federal agencies including [[USAID]] and the [[United States Department of Education]], unilaterally fired several thousand staff, and reduced administrative functions to statutory minimums.[524][525][526] Some actions, such as attempts to dismantle the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], were paused by federal courts.[527] Many of his actions attempted to bring historically independent institutions under direct executive branch control in diminished forms.[528]
During his second presidency, the Trump administration took a series of actions using the government to target political opponents and [[Civil society]].
His actions were described by the media as part of his promised "retribution" and "revenge" campaign, within the context of a strongly personalist and leader-centered conception of politics.[529][511][530] He threatened, signed executive actions, and ordered investigations into his political opponents, critics, and organizations aligned with the Democratic Party.[531] He ended the post-[[Watergate scandal]] norm of [[United States Department of Justice]] independence, weaponizing it and agencies across the federal government to target his political enemies.[532][533] He continued filing personal lawsuits against his political opponents, companies, and news organizations that angered him.[534] By July 2025, Trump had extracted more than $1.2 billion in settlements in a "cultural crackdown" against a variety of institutions that largely chose to settle rather than fight back.[535][536] Trump's actions against civil society were described by hundreds of legal experts and political scientists as [[Authoritarian]], contributing to [[Democratic backsliding in the United States]], and negatively impacting the [[Rule of law]].[537][538][539]
Trump's pardons and grants of clemency favored political allies and loyalists,[540][541] and disproportionately pardoned "the powerful, famous, well-connected and wealthy" accused of white-collar crime.[541] Trump [[Pardon of January 6 United States Capitol attack defendants]] convicted or charged on his first day in office, including those who violently attacked police, by pardoning more than 1,500 and commuting the sentences of 14.[542][543]
Trump inherited a resilient economy from the Biden administration, with increasing economic growth, low unemployment, and declining inflation.[544]
He ordered agencies to stop enforcement of disfavored rules in an attempt at large-scale deregulation that legal experts described as illegal and contrary to decades of federal law.[545][546] He sought greater government control over private businesses and shifted away from traditional conservative [[Free market]] orthodoxy,[547] engaging in [[State capitalism]] by taking direct government equity stakes in multiple U.S. corporations.[548][549][550]
Trump [[2025 United States federal government grant pause]] and made large cuts to scientific research,[551] several of which were found by judges and the [[Government Accountability Office]] as being illegal and unconstitutional.[552][553] Trump and his administration's [[Make America Healthy Again]] agenda promoted [[Anti-science]] and [[Anti-vaccine activism]], resulting in a resurgence of whooping cough and measles.[554][555]
He promoted [[Climate change denial]] and misinformation,[556] appointed oil, gas, and chemical lobbyists to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to reverse climate regulations and pollution controls,[557] and by October 2025 had cancelled $7.6 billion in funding for clean energy projects approved by the previous administration.[558]
Trump relied on declaring national emergencies to justify hundreds of actions and bypass congressional approval or regulatory review.[559] For instance, he declared a national energy emergency, allowing the suspension of environmental regulations, loosening the rules for fossil fuel extraction and limiting renewable energy projects.[560][561] Trump withdrew the U.S. from the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change during his first presidency, [[Presidency of Joe Biden]] reentered the agreement in 2021, and Trump again withdrew from the agreement during his second presidency.[562]
Dismantling government agencies enforcing the laws against political corruption and white-collar fraud,[563] Trump reduced the Department of Justice's [[Public Integrity Section]] from 30 to five lawyers,[564][565] dismissed 17 independent [[Inspector general#United States]] at government agencies[566] and 12 members of independent oversight boards and watchdog agencies,[567] and disbanded the squad in the FBI's Washington field office that investigated allegations of fraud and corruption against government officials and members of Congress.[568][569] He pardoned or dropped charges against officials accused of corruption.[568]
Trump attributed societal problems to [[Diversity, equity, and inclusion]] (DEI) initiatives and [[Woke#United States]].[570] Equating diversity with incompetence,[570] he reversed pro-diversity policies in the federal government.[571][572] He sought to remake civil society to his preferences by executive order.[573][574] On DEI and antisemitism grounds, he threatened cultural institutions[575] and sixty universities,[576] and forced law firms to capitulate to his political agenda.[574]
Trump expanded the domestic use of the military and ordered [[2025 deployment of federal forces in the United States]], and threatened to expand his deployments further.[577][578] Trump had crews [[East Wing#Demolition]] in October 2025 to make room for a [[White House State Ballroom]], which is planned to be nearly twice the size of the White House.[579][580]
Through [[Persecution of transgender people under the second Trump administration#Executive Orders]] and other actions, Trump banned trans people from the military,[581] restricted or defunded gender-affirming healthcare, opposed [[Inclusive language]],[582] censored research and education materials,[583] and targeted schools, universities, and cultural institutions accused of promoting what his government calls "gender ideology",[584] barred transgender athletes from sports, and required US passports to state transgender people's sex assigned at birth.[585]
In July 2025, Trump signed the [[One Big Beautiful Bill Act]] into law.
The bill made the temporary tax cuts of the 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] permanent and added additional tax deductions for a total of around $4.5 trillion, mostly benefiting the highest income brackets and costing people in the lowest income bracket $1,600 per year.
It increased funding for national defense, deportations, the border wall, and Trump's proposed [[Golden Dome (missile defense system)]] missile defense system.
The bill cut funding for [[Medicaid]] and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] and added additional work requirements for eligibility and a $35 co-payment for some Medicaid services; the cuts and additional requirements will take effect after the 2026 general election.
The bill was projected by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to increase the budget deficit by $3.4 trillion by 2034, cause 11.8 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, and eliminate SNAP benefits for three million people.[586][587]
In his first days in office, Trump instructed Border Patrol agents to summarily deport [[Illegal immigration to the United States]] crossing the border and disabled the [[CBP One]] app that was being used to schedule border crossings.
He resumed the [[Remain in Mexico]] policy, designated drug cartels as terrorist groups, and ordered construction to be resumed on a border wall.[588][589] Trump also revoked the parole status of immigrants who entered the U.S. under CBP One and ended [[Parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans]].[589] In March, he used the [[Alien Enemies Act]] of 1798 to [[March 2025 American deportations of Venezuelans]] at the [[Terrorism Confinement Center]] in El Salvador.[590] [[Activist deportations in the second Trump presidency]], legal immigrants, tourists, and students with visas who expressed criticism of his policies or pro-Palestinian advocacy.[591] Several [[Detention and deportation of American citizens in the second Trump administration]].[592]
His administration favored [[Hard power]] to achieve its [[America First]] foreign policy goals,[593] and dismantled or withdrew support from domestic and international organizations dedicated to advancing American [[Soft power]].[594][595] The moves were described as ceding American global influence and creating a void filled by [[Russia]] and [[China]].[596][f] Trump's relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, including threats of annexation.[598][599]
In February 2025, Trump and Vice President Vance [[2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting]] in a highly contentious televised meeting.
Media outlets described it as an unprecedented public confrontation between an American president and a foreign [[Head of state]].[600][601]
Trump and his incoming administration helped broker [[January 2025 Gaza war ceasefire]] alongside the Biden administration, enacted a day prior to his inauguration.[602][603][604] In March, [[March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip]].[604] On October 9, 2025, Israel and Hamas signed an agreement to cease fire and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners as part of the [[Gaza peace plan]] to end the [[Gaza war]].[605]
Trump's economic policies have been described as [[Protectionism in the United States]],[606] with Trump imposing tariffs on most countries, including large tariffs on major trading partners China, Canada, and Mexico.[607] He started a global [[Trade war]], imposing tariffs at the highest level since the 1930 [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] at the onset of the [[Great Depression]].[608][609] Economists argued that the administration misunderstood the relationship between [[Balance of trade]] and tariffs, using flawed assumptions.[610] Trump suspended American financial contributions to the [[World Trade Organization]].[611]
In his second term, Trump selected [[Second cabinet of Donald Trump]] members with personal loyalty to him,[612][613] with the "focus on loyalty over subject-matter expertise".[613] In February 2025, the White House stated that [[Elon Musk]] was a [[Special government employee]].[614] Trump gave Musk's [[Department of Government Efficiency]] (DOGE) access to many federal government agencies.[614] Musk's teams operated in eighteen departments and agencies in the administration's first month,[615] including in the Treasury Department's $5 trillion payment system,[616] the [[Small Business Administration]], the [[Office of Personnel Management]], and the [[General Services Administration]].[617]
Federal judges found many of the administration's actions to be illegal.[618] Following legal setbacks, Trump increased his criticism of the judiciary and called for impeachment of federal judges who ruled against him.[619] By mid-July, a [[Washington Post]] analysis found he defied judges and the courts in roughly one third of all cases against him, actions which were described by legal experts as unprecedented for any presidential administration.[620]
Multiple analyses conducted by academic scholars and [[The New York Times]] found that both Republican and Democratic judicial appointees have found numerous constitutional and statutory flaws with Trump administration policies.[621]
His administration asserted a constitutional right to ignore federal law in its justification of several actions such as in his refusal to enforce a [[Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act]], with legal experts describing it as claiming a "constitutional power to immunize private parties to commit otherwise illegal acts with impunity".[622][623][624]
Beginning with his 2016 campaign, Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the creation of a [[Political movement]] known as Trumpism.[625] His political positions are [[Populist]],[626][627] more specifically described as [[Right-wing populist]].[628][629] He has been described as embracing [[Far-right extremism]],[630][631] and he helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream.[632] Many of his actions and rhetoric have been described as [[Authoritarian]] and contributing to [[Democratic backsliding in the United States]].[633] Trump pushed for an expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the [[Unitary executive theory]].[634][635] His political base [[Trumpism#Cult of personality]] to a [[Cult of personality]].[g]
Trump's rhetoric and actions have been accused of creating and exacerbating anger and distrust through the use of an [[In-group and out-group]].[643] He explicitly and routinely disparages racial, religious, and ethnic minorities,[644] and scholars consistently find that racial animus regarding blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the best predictors of support for Trump.[645] His rhetoric has been described as using [[Fearmongering]] and [[Demagogy]] which [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign#Fearmongering]].[646] He has said that he believes real power comes from fear.[647] The [[Alt-right]] movement coalesced around and supported his candidacy, due in part to its [[Opposition to multiculturalism]] and [[Opposition to immigration]].[648][649][650] He has a strong [[Trumpism#Christian Trumpism]] and [[Christian nationalism#United States]],[651] and his rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric, and agenda of Christian nationalism.[652] Trump has also used [[Anti-communism]] in his rhetoric, regularly calling his opponents "[[Communism]]" and "[[Marxism]]".[653][654]
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been characterized as racist.[655] In a 2018 national poll, about half of respondents said he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[656] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[657] Racist and [[Islamophobic]] attitudes are strong indicators of support for Trump.[658] He has been accused of racism for insisting a group of five black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 [[Central Park jogger case]], even after they were exonerated in 2002.[659]
In 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories]] that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[660] He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama's birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent.[661] In September 2016, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.,[662] though he reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017.[663] During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory.[664] His 2024 campaign made extensive use of [[Dehumanization]] and [[Ethnic stereotype]].[665]
In 2025, he promoted false claims of [[White genocide]] in South Africa[666] and created the [[White South African refugee program]].[667]
Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[668][669] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[669] As of 2020, 26 women have publicly [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations]], including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.
He has denied the allegations.[670] In October 2016, a 2005 "[[Hot mic]]" recording surfaced in which [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape]] about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, "when you're a star, they let you do it.
Grab 'em by the [[Pussy#Female genitalia]]."[671] He characterized the comments as "locker-room talk".[672][673] The incident's widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign.[674]
Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him.[675][676][677] He is described as embracing extremism, [[List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump]] such as [[Q-Anon]], and far-right [[American militia movement]] to a greater extent than any modern American president,[630][678] and engaging in [[Stochastic terrorism]].[679]
Research suggests that Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes,[680][681] and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric.[682] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[683][684] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.[685][686] A nationwide review by [[ABC News (United States)]] in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.[687] Trump's refusal to condemn the white supremacist [[Proud Boys]] during a 2020 presidential debate[688] and his comment, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by", were said to have led to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group.[689] Counterterrorism researchers described his normalization and [[Historical revisionism]] of the January 6 Capitol attack, and [[Pardon of January 6 United States Capitol attack defendants]], as encouraging future political violence.[690][691]
Since before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama "birtherism", [[Climate change denial]], and [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal]].[692][693][694] After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as "[[Big lie (2020 United States presidential election)]]".[695][696]
Trump frequently makes false statements in public remarks,[700][146] to an extent unprecedented in [[American politics]].[700][701][702] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity[701] and have been described as [[Firehosing]].[703] His false and misleading statements were documented by [[Fact-checker]], including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency,[697] increasing in frequency over time.[704]
Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential,[705][706] while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19,[707][708] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and [[Panic-buying]] in Africa and South Asia.[709][710] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in [[England and Wales]] to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served his domestic political purposes.[711] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[712][713] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[714][715][716] He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[717] Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[718][719][720]
He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until [[Twitter]] banned him after the January 6 attack.[721] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press;[722] in 2017, his press secretary said that his [[Tweet (social media)]] constituted official presidential statements.[723] During his 2024 campaign and second presidency he frequently posted AI-generated content of himself as [[Pop-culture]] icons or mocking immigrants.[724][725]
After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[726] In response, he said social media platforms "totally silence" conservatives and he would "strongly regulate, or close them down".[727] After the January 6 attack, he was banned from [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], Twitter, and other platforms.[728] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[729][730] and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter.[731] In February 2022, he launched social media platform [[Truth Social]] where he attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[732] [[Elon Musk]], after [[Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk]], reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.[733][734] The two-year ban at [[Meta Platforms]] lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram.[735]
Trump sought media attention throughout his career, maintaining a "love-hate" relationship with the press.[736] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage,[737] estimated at $2 billion.[738] As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the [[Enemy of the people]]".[739]
All the suits were dismissed.[741][742] By 2024, he repeatedly voiced support for [[Criminalization of dissent]] and criticism,[743] and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him.[744]
In his second term, Trump's actions against the media were unprecedented in modern American history,[745] and historians described them as mirroring actions by authoritarian leaders to censor political opponents and negatively impacting the [[Freedom of speech]] and [[Free press]].[746][747] The campaign to police speech drew comparisons to [[Cancel culture]], government [[Censorship]], and [[McCarthyism]].[748][749][750] Some were sued and many social media companies,[751] broadcasters, and newspapers capitulated to the Trump agenda.[752] Trump launched lawsuits and created blacklists against certain media outlets, took over the process run by the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] to choose what outlets have access to him and made a policy of limited access for all wire services.[753][754] The [[Federal Communications Commission]] launched investigations into media outlets accused of bias against him.[755] As a result of Trump's threats, media executives instructed journalists and their staff to [[Self-censor]] and reduce criticism of Trump,[756] and CBS agreed to create an Ombudsman to monitor its news channels to root out "bias" at CBS News.[757]
In 1977, Trump married [[Ivana Zelníčková]].[758] They had three children: [[Donald Jr.]] (b.
1977), [[Ivanka Trump]] (b.
1981), and [[Eric Trump]] (b.
The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress [[Marla Maples]].[759] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999.
They have one daughter, [[Tiffany Trump]] (b.
1993), whom Maples raised in California.[760] In 2005, he married Slovenian model [[Melania Knauss]].[761] They have one son, [[Barron Trump]] (b.
Trump had a 15-year friendship with [[Jeffrey Epstein]].
Persons who knew them at the time said they frequently hit on and competed for women.[763] Media attention and public pressure mounted in 2025, when his administration did not release [[Jeffrey Epstein client list]], despite Trump's promise to do so during the 2024 campaign.[764]
In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, [[Harold Bornstein]], stating that he would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[772] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.[772][773]
Trump called himself a [[Presbyterian]] and a [[Protestant]] in 2016.[774][775] In 2020, he said he was a [[Nondenominational Christian]].[776] However, many have questioned the depth of these religious affiliations.
In his first term, Trump appointed his personal pastor[780] and spiritual advisor,[781] millionaire televangelist [[Paula White-Cain]], to the White House [[Office of Public Liaison]].[782] During his second term, he appointed her senior advisor of the newly created [[White House Faith Office]].[783][784]
In Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, international approval ratings of U.S. leadership dropped from about 22 percent in a [[Gallup, Inc.]] poll[785] of 134 countries to just 16 percent—lower than China's [[Xi Jinping]] and Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]—in a [[Pew Research]] poll[786] of 13 countries.
After Trump's first term, [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#2021 C-SPAN]] as the fourth-worst president in [[C-SPAN]]'s 2021 survey of presidential historians.[792] He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[793][794] The [[Siena College Research Institute]]'s 2022 survey [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#2022 Siena College]] third-worst.
He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories.[795] In 2018 and 2024, members of the [[American Political Science Association]] ranked him the worst president.[796][797]
