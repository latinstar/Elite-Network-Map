Katanga was one of the four large provinces created in the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1914.
It was one of the eleven [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] between 1966 and 2015, when it was split into the [[Tanganyika Province]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province]], and [[Haut-Katanga]] provinces.
Between 1971 and 1997 (during the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] when Congo was known as [[Zaire]]), its official name was Shaba Province.[1]
Farming and ranching are carried out on the [[Katanga Plateau]].
The eastern part of the province is a rich mining region which supplies [[Cobalt]], [[Copper]], [[Tin]], [[Radium]], [[Uranium]], and [[Diamond]].
The region's former capital, [[Lubumbashi]], is the second-largest city in the Congo.[2][3]
[[Copper mining]] in Katanga dates back over 1,000 years, and mines in the region were producing standard-sized [[Ingots]] of copper for international transport by the end of the 10th century CE.[4]
In the 1890s, the province was beleaguered from the south by [[Cecil Rhodes]]' [[Northern Rhodesia]], and from the north by the [[Belgian Congo]], the personal possession of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]].
[[Msiri]], the King of the [[Yeke Kingdom]], held out against both, but eventually Katanga was subsumed by the Belgian Congo.[5][page needed]
After 1900, the [[Societe Generale de Belgique]] practically controlled all of the mining in the province through [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] (UMHK).
This included [[Uranium]], [[Radium]], copper, [[Cobalt]], [[Zinc]], [[Cadmium]], [[Germanium]], [[Manganese]], [[Silver]], [[Gold]], and [[Tin]].
In 1915, a deposit of [[Pitchblende]] and other uranium minerals of a higher grade than had ever been found before anywhere in the world and higher than any found since were discovered at [[Shinkolobwe]].
After [[World War I]] ended a factory was built at [[Olen, Belgium]]; the secrecy was lifted at the end of 1922 with the announcement of the production of the first gram of radium from the pitchblende.[6] By the start of [[World War II]], the mining companies "constituted a state within the [[Belgian Congo]]".
The [[Shinkolobwe]] mine near [[Jadotville]] (now [[Likasi]]) was at the centre of the [[Manhattan Project]].[7]
In 1960, after the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Republic of the Congo) gained independence from Belgium, the UMHK, [[Moise Tshombe]] and [[Godefroid Munongo]] supported the [[Secession]] of Katanga province from the Congo.
This was supported by Belgium but opposed by the Congolese Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].
This led to the assassination of Lumumba and the [[Katanga Crisis]] (or "Congo Crisis"), which lasted from 1960 to 1965.
The breakaway [[State of Katanga]] existed from 1960 to 1963, then was reintegrated.[8]
Militias such as [[Mai Mai Kata Katanga]] led by [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]] fought for Katanga to secede, and his group briefly took over the provincial capital [[Lubumbashi]] in 2013.[8]
In 2015, Katanga Province was split into the constitutional provinces of [[Tanganyika Province]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province]], and [[Haut-Katanga]].[10][11]
A number of reasons have been advanced for the failure of the vast mineral wealth of the province to increase the overall [[Standard of living]].
[[Lubumbashi]], the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is a hub for many of the country's biggest mining companies.
The Democratic Republic of Congo produces "more than 3 percent of the world’s copper and half its [[Cobalt]], most of which comes from Katanga".[15]
Major mining concessions include [[Tilwezembe]] and Kalukundi.
It also bordered Tanzania – although on [[Lake Tanganyika]] rather than on land.
The [[University of Lubumbashi]], located in the northern part of Lubumbashi city, is the largest university in the province and one of the largest in the country.
Katanga province has the highest rate of [[Infant mortality]] in the world, with 184 of 1000 babies born expected to die before the age of five.[21]
The [[Société nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo]] provides Katanga Province with limited railway service centered on [[Lubumbashi]].
[[Lubumbashi International Airport]] is located northeast of Lubumbashi.
In April 2014, a [[2014 Katanga train derailment]] killed 63 people.[22]
