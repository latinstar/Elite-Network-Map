The Paleo-Balkan languages are a geographical grouping of various [[Indo-European languages]] that were spoken in the [[Balkans]] and surrounding areas in [[Ancient times]].
Paleo-Balkan studies are obscured by the scarce attestation of these languages outside of [[Ancient Greek]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Messapian language]] and [[Phrygian language]].
Although linguists consider each of them to be a member of the Indo-European [[Language family]], the internal relationships are still debated.
A Palaeo-Balkanic or Balkanic Indo-European branch has been proposed in recent research, comprising the [[Albanoid]] ([[Albanian language]]–[[Messapic language]]), [[Armenian language]], and [[Graeco-Phrygian]] ([[Hellenic languages]]–[[Phrygian language]]) subbranches.
Regardless of the name, there is no direct evidence to support the location for the hypothetical common ancestor of these languages in the Balkan peninsula itself.[1] Τhe common stage between the Late [[Proto-Indo-European]] dialects of Pre-Albanian, Pre-Armenian, and Pre-Greek, is considered to have occurred in the Late [[Yamnaya]] period, after the westward migrations of Early Yamnaya across the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]; also remaining in the western steppe for a prolonged period of time, separated from the Indo-European dialects that later gave rise to the [[Corded Ware]] and [[Bell Beaker]] cultures in Europe.[2]
Due to the processes of [[Hellenization]], [[Romanization (cultural)]] and [[Slavicization]] in the Balkans, the only surviving representatives of the ancient languages of the region are [[Greek language]] and Albanian.
The Albanian language evolved from either [[Illyrian languages]], often supported for obvious geographic and historical reasons as well as for some fragmentary linguistic evidence,[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] or an unmentioned language that was closely related to Illyrian and [[Messapic language]].[11][12][13][14]
The [[Centum and satem languages]] character of Illyrian is difficult to detect due to the paucity of the available 'Illyrian' linguistic material and to the dual nature of its interpretation.
Today, the only source of information about the Illyrian language consists of a handful of Illyrian words cited in classical sources, and numerous examples of Illyrian [[Anthroponyms]], [[Ethnonyms]], [[Toponyms]] and [[Hydronyms]].[31]
[[Messapian language]] was spoken on the Italian peninsula, but is generally regarded an offshoot from the Paleo-Balkan language area.
The theory is based on classical sources, [[Archaeology]], as well as [[Onomastic]] considerations.
A grouping of Illyrian with [[Venetic language]] and [[Liburnian language]], once spoken in northeastern [[Italy]] and [[Liburnia]] respectively, is also proposed.
[[Philistine language]] had been linked to many different Indo-European languages to: a [[Pre-Greek substrate]] of the [[Pelasgians]] (by [[Milan Budimir]]),[34] [[Mycenaean Greek]],[35] and Illyrian but these theories are mostly speculation.[36]
Another hypothesis would group Illyrian with [[Dacian language]] and [[Thracian]] into a [[Thraco-Illyrian]] branch,[37] and a competing hypothesis would exclude Illyrian from a [[Daco-Thracian]] grouping in favor of [[Mysian]].[38] The [[Classification of Thracian]] itself is a matter of contention and uncertainty.
The place of [[Paeonian language]] remains unclear.[39] Not much has been determined in the study of Paeonian, and some linguists do not recognize a Paeonian area separate from Illyrian or Thracian.
[[Phrygian language]], on the other hand, is considered to have been most likely a close relative of Greek.[40]
The classification of [[Ancient Macedonian language]] and its relationship to [[Greek language]] is also under investigation.
Sources suggest that Macedonian is in fact a variation of [[Doric Greek]] and a [[Northwest Greek]] dialect,[41][15][42][43] or alternatively a closely related sister language grouped together with Greek in a family called [[Hellenic languages]].[44][45]

While "Paleo-Balkan" languages are conventionally understood as a [[Linguistic area]] grouping, in recent [[Historical linguistic]] research scholars propose a distinct "Balkanic" (or "Paleo-Balkanic") Indo-European branch based on shared Indo-European morphological, lexical, and phonetic innovations, as well as shared lexical proto-forms from a common pre-Indo-European substratum.[46] The Balkanic subgroup comprises three branches of modern and well-attested ancient languages, viz.
Armenian, [[Graeco-Phrygian]] (= [[Hellenic languages]] + Phrygian) and [[Albanoid]] (= Albanian + Messapian).[47] Some scholars further propose that innovations exclusively shared by Greek and Albanian point to a closer link between the latter two branches, which can thus be unified to a "[[Graeco-Albanian]]" branch.[48][49]
Shared innovations include the first person singular mediopassive ending *-mai, and lexical innovations such as *ai̯ĝ- 'goat', dʰeh1s- 'god'.[50] The word for "[[Goat]]" is a remarkable common proto-form of non-Indo-European origin exclusively shared between Albanian, Armenian, and Greek.
It could have been borrowed at a pre-stage that was common to these languages from a pre-Indo-European substrate language that in turn had loaned the word from a third source, from which the pre-IE substrate of the proto-form that is shared between [[Balto-Slavic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages]] could also have borrowed it.
A remarkable PIE root that underwent in Albanian, Armenian, and Greek a common evolution and semantic shift in the post PIE period is PIE *mel-i(t)- 'honey', from which Albanian bletë, Armenian mełu, and Greek μέλισσα (mélissa) or μέλιττα (mélitta) 'bee' derived.[53] However, the Armenian term features -u- through the influence of the PIE *médʰu 'mead', which constitutes an Armenian innovation that isolates it from the [[Graeco-Albanian]] word.[54] Innovative creations of [[Agricultural]] terms shared only between Albanian and Greek were formed from non-agricultural PIE roots through semantic changes to adapt them for agriculture.
Since they are limited only to Albanian and Greek, they could be traced back with certainty only to their last common IE ancestor, and not projected back into [[Proto-Indo-European]].[55]
