Vance is an outspoken critic of [[Childlessness]] and has acknowledged the [[Catholic Church in the United States]] of [[Catholic theology]] on his sociopolitical positions.
Vance was born James Donald Bowman on August 2, 1984, in [[Middletown, Ohio]],[2][3] where he was also raised.[4] His mother is Beverly Carol Aikins (née Vance), and his father was Donald Ray Bowman;[5] they divorced when he was a toddler.[3] Vance wrote in his book Hillbilly Elegy that he was of Scots-Irish descent.[6][7] He grew up in an [[Appalachian American]] culture, spending summers with relatives in [[Jackson, Kentucky]].[8][9][6]
Vance has written that his childhood was marked by poverty and abuse, and that his mother struggled with [[Drug addiction]].[13] He and his elder sister, Lindsay, were raised primarily by their maternal grandparents, James and Bonnie Vance (née Blanton), whom they called "Papaw" and "Mamaw".[14][10]
After graduating from [[Middletown High School (Ohio)]] in 2003, Vance enlisted in the United States Marine Corps,[15] serving as a combat correspondent (military journalist) with the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]].[16] During his four years of service, he was deployed to Iraq in 2005 for six months in a non-combat role, writing articles and taking photographs.[15] In December 2005, he was part of a group of Marines that held a roundtable discussion with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]].[17] He attained the rank of [[Corporal#United States]], and his decorations included the [[Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]] and the [[Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal]].[18]
In 2007, Vance left the military and used the [[G.I. Bill]][19][20] to study at Ohio State University.[21] He graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts [[Summa cum laude]] in political science and philosophy.[22] In 2010, Vance entered Yale Law School,[23] where he worked with a group of editors to check citations for [[The Yale Law Journal]].[24] At Yale Law School, he befriended fellow Ohio native and future Republican politician [[Vivek Ramaswamy]].[25][26] During his first year, Professor [[Amy Chua]] persuaded Vance to begin writing his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.[7][27]
Vance also initiated a rapport with [[Peter Thiel]] after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.[24] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for [[David Frum]]'s "FrumForum" website under the name J.
After graduating from law school, Vance worked for Republican senator [[John Cornyn]].
He spent a year as a [[Law clerk]] for Judge [[David Bunning]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky]],[32] then worked at the law firm [[Sidley Austin]],[33] beginning a brief career as a [[Corporate lawyer]].[34] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a [[Venture capitalist]].[24] Between 2016 and 2017, he was a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, [[Mithril Capital]].[35][36]
In June 2016, [[Harper (publisher)]] published Vance's book, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.[7] The memoir recounts the [[Appalachian culture]] and socioeconomic problems of Vance's upbringing.[37] Hillbilly Elegy was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] in [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2016]] and [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2017]].
The Times listed it among "6 Books to Help Understand Trump's Win",[38] and Vance was profiled in [[The Washington Post]], which called him "the voice of the [[Rust Belt]]".[39] In [[The New Republic]], Sarah Jones criticized Vance as "liberal media's favorite [[White trash]]–splainer" and a "false prophet of [[Blue America]]", calling the book "little more than a list of myths about [[Welfare queen]]".[40] Hillbilly Elegy's success helped propel Vance into contact with social elites, and he began writing a column for The New York Times.
Its chairman, [[Frederic Moll]], said he hired Vance for his intelligence, legal qualifications, and connection to Thiel.[42][43] Vance tried to get [[Mithril Capital]] to invest in Circuit but Mithril passed.
Colin Greenspon, then managing director at Mithril, liked Vance and got him to move to Mithril in 2016.[44] At Mithril, Vance clashed with Mithril's co-founder and managing director [[Mithril Capital#personnel]].
He decided to leave in 2017.[43] Bloomberg reports he deleted all traces of Mithril from his [[LinkedIn]] profile.[45] Vance moved back to Ohio, where he published an op-ed in [[The New York Times]] with the headline "Why I'm moving home", in which he complained about "highly educated transplants" in Silicon Valley.
In another interview, he said elite tech crowds wielded "political-financial power in combination with a certain condescension".[44] In 2017, Vance joined [[Revolution LLC]],[46] an investment firm founded by [[Steve Case]].[46] Greenspon left Mithril and joined Vance at Revolution in 2018.[47][48] At Revolution Vance was tasked with expanding the "Rise of the Rest" initiative, which focuses on growing investments in underserved regions outside [[Silicon Valley]] and New York City.[46]
Vance was a [[CNN]] contributor in 2017 and 2018.[49]
In 2017, Vance sold the [[Film rights]] to Hillbilly Elegy to [[Imagine Entertainment]].[50] In April 2017, [[Ron Howard]] signed on to direct [[Hillbilly Elegy (film)]], which was released in select theaters on November 11, 2020, and later that month on [[Netflix]].[51]
In 2019, Vance was on the board of advisors of the [[With Honor Fund]], a [[Political action committee#Super PACs]] that helps veterans run for office.[52] From 2020 to 2023, he was on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with [[Project 2025]].[53][54]
In 2019, Vance and [[Chris Buskirk]] co-founded the conservative political advocacy group [[Rockbridge Network]].[55] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Marc Andreessen]].[56] In 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.[57] With Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in [[Rumble (website)]], a Canadian [[Online video platform]] popular with the political right.[58][59]
In December 2016, Vance said he planned to move to Ohio and would consider starting a nonprofit or running for office.[60][39] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a [[501(c)(4)]] advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other "social ills" he had mentioned in his memoir.[61] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the advisory board members were [[Keith Humphreys]], [[Jamil Jivani]], [[Yuval Levin]], and [[Sally Satel]].[62][63] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence.[64] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements.[61][65] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's [[Lymphoma]].[66][67] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent most of its revenue on [[Overhead costs]] and travel.
During Vance's 2022 U.S. Senate campaign, [[Tim Ryan (Ohio politician)]], the Democratic nominee, said the charity was a front for Vance's political ambitions.
Vance denied the characterization.[69][70][b] Our Ohio Renewal's tax filings show that in its first year, it spent more (over $63,000) on "management services" provided by its executive director [[Jai Chabria]], who was Vance's top political adviser, than it did on programs to fight opioid abuse.[74][63] In 2017, Vance formed a similarly named [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)]] organization, Our Ohio Renewal Foundation, which raised around $69,000 from 2017 to 2023.[68] As of September 2024, the foundation had not spent any funds since 2019.[75]
According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and a 2019 [[ProPublica]] investigation, the charity's biggest accomplishment, sending psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] to Ohio's Appalachian region for a yearlong residency in 2018, was "tainted" by the ties among Satel, her employer, [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), and [[Purdue Pharma]], in the form of knowledge exchange between Satel and Purdue and financial support from Purdue to AEI.
From March 2017 to April 2021, Vance was on the board of directors of the startup [[AppHarvest]], which carried out indoor [[Vertical farming]] in Kentucky.
In early 2018, Vance considered running for the [[U.S. Senate]] against [[Sherrod Brown]],[80] but did not.[81] In March 2021, [[Peter Thiel]] gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a [[Super PAC]] created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.[82][83][84] [[Robert Mercer]] also gave an undisclosed amount.[82] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by [[Rob Portman]].[85] In May, he launched an [[Exploratory committee]].[86]
Vance announced his Senate campaign in Ohio on July 1, 2021.[3] On May 3, 2022, he won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote,[87] defeating multiple candidates, including [[Josh Mandel]] (23%) and [[Matt Dolan]] (22%).[88] On November 8, in the general election, Vance defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)]] nominee [[Tim Ryan (Ohio politician)]] with 53% of the vote to Ryan's 47%.[3][89] This vote share was considered a vast underperformance compared to other Ohio Republicans, especially in the [[2022 Ohio gubernatorial election]].[90] Vance had often previously spelled his name with periods after his initials ("J.D.")—including in the publication of Hillbilly Elegy—but after becoming a candidate for office, he removed the periods ("JD").[1]
On January 3, 2023, Vance was sworn into the Senate as a member of the [[118th United States Congress]].
On March 1, 2023, Vance and Senator [[Sherrod Brown]] co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to prevent derailments like the one in [[East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment]],[92][93] but the bill failed due to lack of intra-caucus Republican support.[94][95][96] In June 2023, Vance voted against raising the debt ceiling, standing against final passage of the [[Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023]][97] and saying it would result in "a reduced military in the face of a rising threat from China".[98]
In July 2023, Vance and Representative [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]] introduced legislation that would have made [[Gender-affirming care]] for minors a federal crime, with penalties of up to 12 years in prison.[99] In June 2024, Vance sponsored the Dismantle DEI Act, which would ban federal [[Diversity, equity, and inclusion]] programs and funding for agencies, contractors, and organizations receiving federal funds.[100][101] Vance was not present for any Senate votes during his vice-presidential campaign.[102][103]
Vance became Ohio's senior senator on January 3, 2025, upon the swearing-in of [[Bernie Moreno]].
At midnight on January 10, Vance resigned from the Senate in anticipation of his inauguration as [[Vice president of the United States]] on [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump]].[104] On January 17, Governor [[Mike DeWine]] announced his appointment of [[Jon Husted]] to the Senate seat Vance vacated.[105]
On January 31, 2023, Vance endorsed former president Donald Trump in the [[2024 Republican Party presidential primaries]].[106][107] On July 15, 2024, the first day of the [[2024 Republican National Convention]], Trump announced on [[Truth Social]] that he had chosen Vance as his running mate.[108] On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate.[109]
Along with Vance, North Dakota governor [[Doug Burgum]], Florida senator [[Marco Rubio]], and South Carolina senator [[Tim Scott]] were finalists to be Trump's running mate.[110] Trump's two eldest sons, [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]], advocated for Vance.
Several media and industry figures are said to have lobbied for Vance to be on the ticket, including [[Elon Musk]], [[David O.
Sacks]], [[Tucker Carlson]], and [[Peter Thiel]], who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.[111][112] [[The Heritage Foundation]], which drafted [[Project 2025]], privately advocated for Vance.[113] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory".
David Sacks, a prominent GOP donor and Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter: "This is who I want by Trump's side: an American patriot." In 2022, Sacks gave a [[Political action committee]] supporting Vance's Senate campaign $900,000, and Thiel added $15 million.[114] It was initially reported that Musk would contribute $45 million monthly to the Trump-Vance campaign,[115] but Musk later said he planned to donate "much lower amounts".[116][117]
On May 15, 2024, Trump attended a $50,000 per head private fundraising dinner with Vance in [[Cincinnati]].[118] Guests included [[Chris Bortz]] and Republican fundraiser [[Nate Morris]].[119] Vance appeared at significant conservative political events and in June was described as a potential running mate for Trump.[120][121] In July, a former friend of Vance's from Yale Law School exposed to the media communications between them and Vance from 2014 to 2017, with the friend alleging that Vance has "changed [his] opinion on literally every imaginable issue that affects everyday Americans" in pursuit of "political power and wealth".[122][123]
In late July 2024, after President [[Joe Biden]] [[Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election]] for [[Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign]] and Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] became a [[Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign]], Vance said at a private fundraiser that the "bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden ...
Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did"; a day later, Vance told the media: "I don't think the political calculus changes at all" whether Harris or Biden was the Democratic nominee.[124] Following criticism of his past remarks and political positions, Vance said in an August 2024 interview that a vice president "doesn't really matter" and that "Kamala Harris has been a bad vice president".[125] This came after Trump said that the "vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact".[125] In late August, after the Trump campaign was embroiled in controversy for allegedly bringing cameras into a restricted area of [[Arlington National Cemetery]] during Trump's visit there, Vance first said that Harris "can go to hell" because "she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up", and then said "Don't do this fake outrage thing".
At the time of his comments, Harris had not publicly discussed the [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign#Arlington National Cemetery incident]].[126][127][128]
In late September 2024, Vance spoke at a western Pennsylvania town hall event organized by [[Lance Wallnau]], who has promoted [[Election denial movement in the United States]] and called Kamala Harris a "demon".[132][133][134] In October 2024, Vance said he did not believe Trump lost the [[2020 United States presidential election]] and that he believed "Big Tech rigged the election" through censorship.[135]
Shortly after being named Trump's running mate, Vance was criticized for saying in a 2021 [[Fox News]] interview, "we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless [[Cat ladies]] who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."[136] The resurfaced comments, which were posted by [[MeidasTouch]] editor-in-chief [[Ron Filipkowski]], sparked an immediate backlash across news and social media.[137][138] On July 26, 2024, Vance clarified his remarks on [[The Megyn Kelly Show]], saying, "It's not a criticism of people who don't have children" and "this is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child".[139] He has said that being "pro-babies and pro-family" should be the Republican Party's highest priority.[140]
In a 2020 podcast interview, he said that being childless "makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable".[141] Vance's campaign referred to "radical childless leaders in this country" in a fundraising email sent after his appearance on [[Tucker Carlson Tonight]].
CNN found multiple examples of Vance making similarly disparaging remarks about childless people, primarily Democratic officials.[142] In a 2021 speech at a [[Center for Christian Virtue]] leadership meeting, Vance said that childless teachers were "trying to brainwash the minds of our children" and criticized [[American Federation of Teachers]] President [[Randi Weingarten]], saying: "If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone."[143] He also suggested in a March 2021 interview on [[Charlie Kirk]] that childless people should be taxed at a higher rate than those with children, adding that the U.S. should "reward the things that we think are good" and "punish the things that we think are bad".[144] In an August 2024 interview on [[Face the Nation]], Vance said he supported increasing the [[Child tax credit (United States)]] from $2,000 per child to $5,000 per child, even though his Senate Republican colleagues had blocked an expanded child tax credit two weeks earlier while he was absent for the vote, having called it a "show vote" and saying it would not have passed even if he had been present.[145][146]
In September 2024, Vance alleged that Haitian illegal immigrants were "draining social services and generally causing chaos all over [[Springfield, Ohio]]" and that "reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country".
Trump subsequently echoed the allegations, including during [[2024 United States presidential debates]].
Springfield authorities said there were "no credible reports or specific claims" of such incidents and that "Haitian immigrants are here legally".[147][148] Vance then said that it was "possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false", but also told his supporters to "keep the cat memes flowing".[149] He then promoted conservative activist [[Christopher Rufo]]'s allegation that African migrants were eating cats in [[Dayton, Ohio]]; Dayton authorities reported "no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets".[150][151]
That a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here"; the child had actually died in an accidental collision between vehicles in Springfield, and the child's father criticized Vance for using the child's "death for political gain".[152][153] Vance also alleged a "massive rise in communicable diseases" in Springfield, but [[Clark County, Ohio]]'s health commissioner reported having "not seen a substantial increase in all reportable communicable diseases".[154] After Vance's and Trump's allegations, Springfield experienced multiple [[Bomb threat]] in September.
The vice presidential debate was held on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, at 9:00 p.m. EDT at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in New York City.[157]
[[CBS]] stated in late September that the moderators would not fact-check the candidates during the debate, with fact-checking instead handled online and on-air only after the debate.[158] When Vance was fact checked on the status of [[Springfield pet-eating hoax]], he objected saying, "The rules were that you were not going to fact check", and argued that the immigrants should not be considered legal because the federal government decided their protected status after they had arrived in the United States.[159] Walz rejected Vance's argument, and the microphones were muted as Vance continued speaking.[160]
In July 2024, a CNN poll analysis after the Republican National Convention showed a net-negative approval rating for Vance.[90] That week, Vance's middling public reception and other concerns led some prominent Republican politicians and political analysts to say that he may have been a poor choice of running mate, especially in light of the shift in the election's dynamics upon [[Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election]] from the election and advent of [[Kamala Harris]] as the Democratic nominee.[162]
After the October 2024 vice-presidential debate, A CBS News/[[YouGov]] poll of 1,630 likely debate viewers found Vance's favorability rose from 40% to 49%, while Walz's increased from 52% to 60%.
At noon on January 20, 2025, Vance became the 50th vice president of the United States, [[Oath of office of the vice president of the United States]] by Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]].[164] Before his inauguration, he held a meeting with China's vice president [[Han Zheng]] in which they discussed [[China–United States relations]].[165] Vance is also the first Marine Corps veteran to serve as vice president.[166]
Among Vance's first acts as vice president was swearing in Secretary of State [[Marco Rubio]], the first of Trump's cabinet nominees to be approved by Congress, on January 21.[167] On January 24, he cast the [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by the vice president of the United States]] to confirm [[Pete Hegseth]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense]].[168] In February 2025, after multiple federal judges issued temporary rulings against various [[Second presidency of Donald Trump]] actions, Vance wrote, "judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power".[169]
In a first for a sitting U.S. vice president, in March 2025 Vance visited [[Greenland]], where he said "We can't just ignore the president's desires" for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.[170] He also warned that Greenland faced the "encroachment of powerful countries" China and Russia "as they expand their ambitions", while declaring in a "message to [[Denmark]]" that "you have not done a good job".
In his February 2025 speech at the [[Munich Security Conference]] (MSC), partially due to what he said were examples in Romania, England, Scotland, and Germany, Vance called "the threat from within" his biggest concern in terms of security for Europe, "not Russia, not China".[173]
Several media outlets regarded the speech as a turning point in [[European Union–United States relations]] along with President Trump's [[2025 Putin–Trump call]] with [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]].
Some called it a declaration of "ideological war"[174] and "[[Culture war]]" against the United States' European allies, and a "wrecking ball" to the decades-long status quo of transatlantic relations.[175][176]
On February 28, 2025, Vance and Trump met Ukrainian President [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] in the White House's Oval Office in front of journalists in an internationally broadcast event.[177][178] Vance was mostly quiet for the meeting's first 40 minutes, but then interjected to answer a question about Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.[177][179] Vance told Zelenskyy: "The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy ...
Vance has been described as a [[National conservative]],[185][186] [[Right-wing populist]],[185][187] and an ideological successor to [[Paleoconservative]] such as [[Pat Buchanan]].[188] Vance describes himself, and has been described by others, as a member of the [[Postliberalism]] right.[189][190][191][192] He has said he was influenced by [[Catholic social teaching]].[193] He has endorsed books by [[Kevin Roberts (political strategist)]], president of [[The Heritage Foundation]], and far-right conspiracy theorist [[Jack Posobiec]].[194][195]
On social issues, Vance is considered [[Social conservatism]].[196] He [[Anti-abortion movements]],[197][198] [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]],[196] and [[Gun control]].[199][200][201] He has taken a number of [[Natalist]] positions.
He has repeatedly expressed a belief that [[Childlessness]] is linked to [[Sociopathy]].
Vance has repeatedly asserted that parents should have more voting power than non-parents,[202][203] but he backtracked from that suggestion in August 2024.[204] He has proposed federal criminalization of [[Transgender health care#Eligibility of minors]].[205] He supports Israel in the [[Gaza war]].[206] He opposes continued [[United States and the Russian invasion of Ukraine]] during the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and prefers a [[Peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine]].[207][208][209] He has argued that the country's largest and most powerful institutions have united against the right.[210] He has said there is a "need to seize the institutions of the left" and has called for "a de-[[Woke]]-ification program" even if the courts say it is illegal.[211][212] He is critical of universities, which he has called "the enemy".[213] Vance is also critical of both the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].[214]
In 2016, Vance was an outspoken critic of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, calling him "reprehensible" and himself a "[[Never Trump]] guy".[215][216][217][218] In 2021, after Vance announced his Senate candidacy, he publicly announced support for Trump, apologizing for his past criticisms of Trump and deleting some of them.[219][220] That year, Vance advised Trump to fire all civil servants and replace them with Trump supporters.[221] Vance has said that if he had been vice president during the [[2020 U.S. presidential election]], he would not have certified the results.
Instead, Vance said that some states Trump lost should [[Trump fake electors plot]] so that [[Contingent election]].[222]
Vance wrote in his memoir, [[Hillbilly Elegy]], that he was raised in a low-income family by his single mother and grandmother.[7][223] In 2013, Vance met [[Usha Chilukuri]] while both were students at Yale Law School.[224] On June 14, 2014, they married in Kentucky in an [[Interfaith marriage]] ceremony;[225][226] she is [[Hindu]] and he is Christian.[225] The wedding included a Bible reading by Vance's "best friend", [[Jamil Jivani]],[66][227] and the bride and groom were blessed by a Hindu [[Pandit]].[224][228] Usha clerked for a year for [[Brett Kavanaugh]], at the time an [[Appeals court]] judge in Washington, then clerked for Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] for a year.[229]
JD and Usha Vance have three children.[228] They own over 100 [[Acres]] of land in [[Kentucky]].[14] In 2018, he purchased a 157-year old home for $1,400,000 in [[East Walnut Hills, Cincinnati]].[230][231]
Vance was raised in a "conservative, [[Evangelical]]" branch of [[Protestantism]].[232] Vance has described that at the time he entered college, he was an [[Atheist]].[233] By September 2016, he was "not an active participant" in any particular Christian denomination, but was "thinking very seriously about converting to Catholicism".[232] In August 2019, Vance was [[Baptized]] and [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church]].
He chose [[Augustine of Hippo]] as his [[Confirmation name]].
Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing [[Catholic theology]]'s alignment with his political views.[234][235][236] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by [[Peter Thiel]].[237] He was criticized by [[Pope Francis]] for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by invoking the traditional concept of [[Ordo amoris]] present in [[Catholic theology]], which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners[238] and equates with the slogan "[[America First]]".[239][240]
[[Nate Vance]], JD's cousin and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, volunteered to fight for Ukraine in 2022 after Russia's invasion.
Nate served in the "[[Da Vinci Wolves]]" unit, fighting in major battles like [[2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive]] and [[Battle of Bakhmut]].
He expressed disappointment that JD, despite their family connection, did not consult him for insights on the war.[241][242][243] Vance's half-brother, Cory Bowman, ran for office but lost in the [[2025 Cincinnati mayoral election]].[244]
