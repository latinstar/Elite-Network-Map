Education in Germany is primarily the responsibility of individual German [[States of Germany]] (Länder), with the federal government only playing a minor role.
While [[Kindergarten]] (nursery school) is optional, formal education is compulsory for all children from the age of 6-7.
For example, in [[Bavaria]], children need to attend school for a total of 12 years (of which 3 may be for an apprenticeship);[1] while in [[Brandenburg]], school must be attended until the end of the school year in which the pupil turns 18.[2] Students can complete three types of [[School leaving qualification]], ranging from the more  vocational  [[Hauptschulabschluss]] and [[Mittlere Reife]] over to the more academic [[Abitur]].
A [[Bachelor's degree]] is commonly followed up with a [[Master's degree]], with 45% of all undergraduates proceeding to postgraduate studies within 1.5 years of graduating.[3] While rules vary (see → § Tuition fees) from [[States of Germany]] (state) to Land, German public universities generally don't charge tuition fees.
Germany is well-known internationally for its  vocational  training model,[4][5][6] the [[Apprenticeship in Germany]] (apprenticeship), with about 50 per cent of all school leavers entering  vocational  training.[7]
One, the [[Gymnasium (Germany)]], is designed to prepare pupils for higher [[Education]] and finishes with the final examination, [[Abitur]], after grade 12 or 13.
From 2005 to 2018 a school reform known as [[Abitur after twelve years]] provided the Abitur in 8 school years.
The [[Realschule]] has a range of emphasis for intermediate pupils and finishes with the final examination [[Mittlere Reife]], after grade 10; the [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for  vocational  education and finishes with the final examination [[Hauptschulabschluss]], after grade 9 and the [[Realschulabschluss]] after grade 10.
A less common[9] secondary school alternative is the so-called [[Comprehensive school]], i.e. comprehensive school.
There are also [[Special school]], schools for students with special educational needs.
One in 21 pupils attends a Förderschule.[10][11] Nevertheless, the Förder- or Sonderschulen can also lead, in special circumstances, to a [[Hauptschulabschluss]] of both type 10a or type 10b, the latter of which is the Realschulabschluss.
A special system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung (the [[Dual education system]]) allows pupils in  vocational  courses to do in-service training in a company as well as at a state school.[11]
Historically, [[Lutheranism]] had a strong influence on German culture, including its education.
[[Martin Luther]] advocated compulsory schooling so that all people would independently be able to read and interpret the Bible.
German public schools generally have [[Religious education]] provided by the churches in cooperation with the state ever since.
During the 18th century, the [[Prussia]] was among the first countries in the world to introduce free and generally compulsory primary education, consisting of an eight-year course of basic education,[[Volksschule]].
In 1810, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Prussia introduced state certification requirements for teachers, which significantly raised the standard of teaching.
When the [[German Empire]] was formed in 1871, the school system became more centralized.
After 1919, the [[Weimar Republic]] established a free, universal four-year elementary school (Grundschule).
During the [[Nazi Germany]] era (1933–1945), though the curriculum was reshaped to teach the beliefs of the regime,[18] the basic structure of the education system remained unchanged.
The [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) started its own standardized education system in the 1960s.
The East German equivalent of both primary and secondary schools was the [[Polytechnic Secondary School]] (Polytechnische Oberschule), which all students attended for 10 years, from the ages of 6 to 16.
After [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II]] (Soviet Union, France, United Kingdom, and the U.S.) ensured that Nazi ideology was eliminated from the curriculum.
When West Germany gained partial independence in 1949, its new constitution ([[Grundgesetz]]) granted educational autonomy to the state (Länder) governments.
In 2000 after much public debate about Germany's perceived low international ranking in [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), there has been a trend towards a less ideological discussion on how to develop schools.
In Germany, education is the responsibility of the states (Länder) and part of their constitutional sovereignty (Kulturhoheit der Länder).[20] Teachers are employed by the Ministry of Education for the state and usually have a job for life after a certain period ([[Beamter]]) (which, however, is not comparable in timeframe nor competitiveness to the typical tenure track, e.g. at universities in the US).
They are often run by city or town administrations, churches, or registered societies, many of which follow a certain educational approach as represented, e.g., by [[Montessori]] or [[Reggio Emilia approach]] or Berliner Bildungsprogramm.
[[Forest kindergarten]] are well established.
The [[Weimar Constitution]] banned these, feeling them to be an unjustified privilege, and the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] still contains the constitutional rule (Art.
[[Homeschooling]] is – between Schulpflicht (compulsory schooling) beginning with elementary school to 18 years – illegal in Germany.
After this, the apprentice is registered on a list at the [[Chamber of commerce]] (IHK) (chamber of industry and commerce).
Here the student is registered with certain bodies, e.g. [[Voluntary association]] such as the German Bar Association (Deutsche Rechtsanwaltskammer, GBA) (board of directors).
In all states except [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]], this orientation phase is embedded into the program of the secondary schools.
All German states have Gymnasium as one possibility for the more able children, and all states—except [[Saxony]]—have some Gesamtschulen, but in different forms.
Students at certain Gymnasium are required to learn [[Latin]] as their first foreign language and choose a second foreign language.
For example, in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]], English starts in the third year of elementary school.
[[Baden-Württemberg]] starts with English or French in the first year.
The [[Saarland]], which borders France, begins with French in the third year of primary school and French is taught in high school as the main foreign language.
Stepping up is always provided by the school system.[clarification needed]
Adults who did not achieve a Realschulabschluss or Abitur, or reached its equivalent, have the option of attending evening classes at an [[Abendgymnasium]] or [[Abendrealschule]].
The other holiday periods occur in spring (during the period around [[Easter Sunday]]) and autumn (during the former harvest, where farmers used to need their children for field work).
There are significant differences between the 16 states' alternatives to this basic template, such as [[Waldorf school]] or other private schools.
In Germany, Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], the constitution of Germany, guarantees the right to establish private schools.
This article belongs to the first part of the German [[Basic law]], which defines [[Civil and political rights]] and human rights.
A right which is guaranteed in this part of the Grundgesetz can only be suspended in a [[State of emergency]] if the respective article specifically states this possibility.
This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect them from a second [[Gleichschaltung]] or similar event in the future.
An Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as those of a state school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz forbids the segregation of pupils based on [[Socioeconomic status]] (the so-called Sonderungsverbot).
At the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) for example, after considering socioeconomic class, students at private schools underperformed those at state schools.[31] One has, however, to be careful interpreting that data: it may be that such students do not underperform because they attend a private school, but that they attend a private school because they underperform.
Teachers at those schools are qualified professionals who have specialized in [[Special education]] while at university.
Some special-needs children do not attend special schools, but are mainstreamed into a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school) and/or, in rare cases, into a Realschule or even a Gymnasium.
In 1987/1988 he tested 7000 third graders on a test based on the German version of the [[Cattell Culture Fair III]] test.
As of January 2015 the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)[34] listed Germany as having 164 international schools.[35] ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms: "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation."[35] This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].[36] In 1971 the first [[International Baccalaureate]] World School was authorized in Germany.[37] Today 70 schools offer one or more of the IB programmes including two who offer the new IB Career-related Programme.[38]
The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), coordinated by the [[OECD]], assesses the skills of 15-year-olds in OECD countries and a number of partner countries.
In the test of 41 countries, Germany ranked 21st in reading and 20th in both mathematics and the [[Natural sciences]], prompting calls for reform.[39] Major newspapers ran special sections on the PISA results, which were also discussed extensively on radio and television.
Some German teachers' representatives and a number of scientists disputed the PISA findings.[46] They claimed, amongst other things, that the questions had been ill-translated, that the samples drawn in some countries were not representative, that German students (most of whom had never done a multiple choice tests in their lives before) were disadvantaged by the multiple choice questions, that the PISA questions had no curricular validity and that PISA was "in fact an IQ-test",[47][48] which according to them showed that [[Dysgenics]] was taking place in Germany.[49][50][51][52][53] Additionally, the OECD was criticized for following its own agenda of a strictly economically utilitarian education policy—as opposed to humanist education policy following the German ideal of [[Bildung]]—and for trying to establish an educational testing industry without democratic legitimation.[54][55]
This is called the [[German model]] or [[Dual education system]] (Duale Ausbildung).
Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[64] Germany ranks third in the [[QS World University Rankings]] 2011.[65]
Most German universities are public institutions, charging fees of only around €60–500 per semester for each student, usually to cover expenses associated with the [[University cafeteria]] and (usually mandatory) public transport tickets.[66][67] Thus, academic education is open to most citizens and studying is very common in Germany.
The [[Dual education system]] combines both practical and theoretical education but does not lead to academic degrees.
The oldest [[List of universities in Germany]] are also among the oldest and best regarded in the world, with [[Heidelberg University]] being the oldest (established in 1386 and in continuous operation since then).
It is followed by [[Cologne University]] (1388), [[Leipzig University]] (1409), [[University of Rostock]] (1419), [[University of Greifswald]] (1456), [[University of Freiburg]] (1457), [[University of Munich]] (1472) and the [[University of Tübingen]] (1477).
While German universities have a strong focus on research, a large part of it is also done outside of universities in independent institutes that are embedded in academic clusters, such as within the [[Max Planck Society]], [[Fraunhofer Society]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] institutes.
As an example, Fachschulen for technological subjects can be cited, which are completed with a state examination ([[European Qualifications Framework]] level 6).[69]
Only Universitäten have the right to confer doctorates and [[Habilitation]].
Specialized universities which have the formal status of Universität include [[Technische Universität]], Pädagogische Hochschulen (Universities of Education), Kunsthochschulen (Universities of Arts) and Musikhochschulen (Universities of Music).
The [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] has awarded eleven universities with the title University of Excellence.
Prior to the [[Bologna Process]], Fachhochschule graduates received a [[Diplom]].
High school diplomas received from countries outside of Germany are, in many cases, not considered equivalent to the Abitur, but rather to a [[Realschulabschluss]] and therefore do not qualify the bearer for admission to a German university.
These criteria depend on the school leaving certificate of the potential student and are agreed upon by the [[Kultusministerkonferenz]].
For example, holders of the US high school diploma with a combined math and verbal score of 1300 on the [[SAT]] or 29 on the [[ACT (test)]] may qualify for university admission.
Foreign students lacking the entrance qualification can acquire a degree at a [[Studienkolleg]], which is often recognized as an equivalent to the Abitur.
This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only in some of the states), a fee for [[Studentenwerk]], which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students).
In 2005, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that a federal law prohibiting tuition fees was unconstitutional, on the grounds that education is the sole responsibility of the states.
Even after the abolition of general tuition fees, tuition fees for long-time students remain in six states.[84] Additionally, universities may charge tuition fees for so called non-consecutive master's degree programs, which do not build directly on a bachelor's degree, such as a [[Master of Business Administration]].
With much controversy, the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] has reintroduced tuition fees at public universities starting in 2017.
There is a state-funded study loan programme, called [[BAföG]] (Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz, "Federal Education Aid Act").
Since the end of [[World War II]], the number of young people entering a university has more than tripled in Germany, but university attendance is still lower than that of many other European nations.
This can be explained with the [[Dual education system]] with its strong emphasis on apprenticeships and  vocational  schools.
The number is the highest in [[Berlin]] and the lowest in [[Schleswig-Holstein]].[citation needed] Similarly, the ratio of school graduates with university entrance qualification varies by state between 38% and 64%.[91]
The organizational structure of German universities goes back to the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]] introduced by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] in the early 19th century, which identifies the unity of teaching and research as well as academic freedom as ideals.
Colleges elsewhere had previously dedicated themselves to religion and classic literature, and Germany's shift to a research-based model was an institutional innovation.[92] This model lead to the foundation of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and influenced the higher education systems of numerous countries.
This [[Academic freedom]] is laid down in the German constitution.
Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from [[Studentenwerk]], a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs.
Recently, the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]] introduced bachelor's and master's degrees as well as [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] to the German higher education system.
Previously, universities conferred [[Diplom]] and [[Magister degree]] degrees depending on the field of study, which usually took 4–6 years.
In the majority of subjects, students can only study for [[Bachelor's degree]] and master's degrees, as Diplom or Magister courses do not accept new enrollments.
In addition, there are courses leading to the [[Staatsexamen]] (state examination).
The holder of a Habilitation may work as [[Privatdozent]].
The raw output of scientific research from Germany consistently ranks among the world's best.[94] The [[National academy]] of Germany is the [[Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].
Additionally, the [[Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities]] acts as an umbrella organization for eight local academies and [[Acatech]] is the Academy of Science and Engineering.[95]
Every year, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft awards ten outstanding scientists working at German research institutions with the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]], Germany's most important research prize.
The influence of social class on educational achievement is much greater in western Germany than it is in [[Eastern Germany]] (former GDR).
Because of this [[Regression analysis]] was used.
However [[Correlation does not imply causation]] and the ELEMENT-study revealed that if other factors were taken into account for the language spoken at home, this had no effect on mathematical performance.
One finding is that those admitted to a Gymnasium after the fourth grade showed better mathematical ability than those who stayed in primary school, [[Ab initio]].
The [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] revealed that working class children needed better reading abilities than middle-class children to be nominated for the [[Gymnasium (Germany)]].
Germany's [[The Left (Germany)]] brought up the discussion about [[Affirmative action]].
Children from [[Neukölln]] (a poor neighbourhood) would not feel good about themselves if they had to attend that type of school that mainly serves pupils from social classes different from their own.
There is a constant public debate about [[Tracking (education)]] by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule).
Proponents of streaming claim that it limits [[Residential segregation]] between rich and poor areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area.
