Founded by former [[Oracle Corporation]] executive [[Marc Benioff]] in March 1999, Salesforce grew quickly, making its [[Initial public offering]] in 2004.
As of September 2025[update], Salesforce is the [[List of public corporations by market capitalization]] with a value of nearly US$238 billion.[2] It became the world's largest enterprise applications firm in 2022.[3] Salesforce ranked 491st on the 2023 edition of the [[Fortune 500]], making $31.352 billion in revenue.[4] Since 2020, Salesforce has also been a component of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]; it is the youngest company in the index.[5]
Salesforce was founded on March 8, 1999, by former [[Oracle Corporation]] executive [[Marc Benioff]], together with Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) company.[6][7][8] The first prototype of Salesforce was launched in November 1999.[8]
Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were [[Larry Ellison]], the co-founder and first CEO of [[Oracle Corporation]], and [[Halsey Minor]], the founder of [[CNET]].[7]
Salesforce was severely affected by the [[Dot-com bubble]] bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, resulting in the company laying off 20% of its workforce.
Salesforce also gained notability during this period for its "the end of software" tagline and marketing campaign, and even hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a [[Siebel Systems]] conference.[9] Salesforce's revenue continued to increase, moving from $5.4 million in 2000 to $22.4 million in 2001.[10][11]
In June 2004, the company had its [[Initial public offering]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[14][15] In 2006, Salesforce launched Idea Exchange, a platform that allows customers to connect with company product managers.[16]
In 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform.[18] In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform.[19] In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein, an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's cloud services.[20][21] It reportedly acquired a 20-year license to be the exclusive business-oriented software company allowed to use [[Albert Einstein]]'s likeness for $20 million.[22]

In 2020, Salesforce joined the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], replacing energy giant and [[Standard Oil]]-descendant [[ExxonMobil]].[24] Salesforce's ascension to the Dow Jones was concurrent with that of [[Amgen]] and [[Honeywell]].[5] Because the Dow Jones factors its components by market price, Salesforce was the largest technology component of the index at its accession.[25]
Across 2020 and 2021, Salesforce saw some notable leadership changes; in February 2020, co-chief executive officer Keith Block stepped down from his position in the company.[26] [[Marc Benioff]] remained as chairman and chief executive officer.[27] In February 2021, Weaver, previously the chief legal officer, became CFO, where she served until stepping down in August 2024.[28] Former CFO Mark Hawkins announced that he would be retiring in October.[29][30] In November 2021, [[Bret Taylor]] was named vice chair and co-CEO of the company.[31]
In December 2020, it was announced that Salesforce would acquire [[Slack Technologies]] for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[32] The acquisition closed in July 2021.[33] Journalists covering the acquisition emphasized the price Salesforce paid for Slack, which was a 54% premium compared to Slack's market value.[34][better source needed]

In January 2023, the company announced a [[Layoff]] of about 10%, or approximately 8,000 positions.
According to Benioff, the company hired too aggressively during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and the increase in working from home led to the layoff.
The company also reduced office space as part of the restructuring plan.[42] The same month brought an announcement from [[Activist investor]] [[Elliott Investment Management]] that it would acquire a "big stake" in the company.[43]
In October 2025, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff declared his avid support of the [[Donald Trump]] and urged him to deploy the [[National Guard (United States)]] to San Francisco as Trump was [[2025 deployment of federal forces in the United States]].[45] The comments generated significant controversy for Benioff and Salesforce,[46] including push-back from San Francisco mayor [[Daniel Lurie]] and District Attorney [[Brooke Jenkins]][47] and the resignation of [[Ron Conway]] from the Salesforce Foundation board.[48] Benioff subsequently apologized for his National Guard comments.[49] That same month, Salesforce pitched the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump]] on ways that Salesforce's AI tools could help [[United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) triple its staff to support the administration's [[Deportation in the second Trump administration]].[50] The company had previously contracted for ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations.[50]

Salesforce confirmed the campaign abused user trust and [[Vishing]] techniques, clarifying that no vulnerability in the Salesforce platform itself was exploited.[141][142][143]
[144]
UNC6395[145] [[Threat actor]] compromised [[OAuth]] and refresh tokens through the [[Salesloft]]-Drift integration, enabling unauthorized access to Salesforce customer instances for data theft and extortion.
