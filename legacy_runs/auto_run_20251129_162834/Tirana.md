Tirana[c] (/tɪˈrɑːnə/ ⓘ tih-RAH-nə,[14][15] Albanian pronunciation: [tiˈɾana]; [[Gheg Albanian language]]: Tirona[d]) is the capital and [[List of cities and towns in Albania]] of [[Albania]].
It is located in the centre of the country, enclosed by mountains and hills, with [[Dajti]] rising to the east and a slight valley to the northwest overlooking the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the distance.
Tirana was founded in 1614 by [[Ottoman Albania]] general [[Sulejman Bargjini]], centered on the [[Sulejman Pasha Mosque]] and [[Sulejman Pasha Tomb]].
The site of present-day Tirana has been continuously inhabited since the [[Iron Age]] and was likely the core of the [[Illyrian kingdom]] of the [[Taulantii]], which in [[Classical antiquity]] was centred in the hinterland of [[Durrës]].
Following the [[Illyrian Wars]], it was annexed by the [[Roman Empire]].
With the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the fourth century, most of Albania came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]].
The city was fairly unimportant until the 20th century, when the [[Congress of Lushnjë]] proclaimed it as Albania's capital after the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912.
Classified as a [[Global city]],[17] Tirana is the most important economic, financial, political, and trade centre in Albania due to its significant location in the centre of the country.
As the seat of power of the [[Government of Albania]], it hosts the official residences of the [[President of Albania]] and [[Prime Minister of Albania]] and the [[Parliament of Albania]].
The city was announced as the [[European Youth Capital]] for 2022.
The area of Tirana has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times with the earliest recognised reference found at the [[Cave of Pëllumbas]] belonging to the Palaeolithic period.
[[Illyrians]] were the first population of the area and formed most likely the core of the [[Illyrian kingdom]] of the [[Taulantii]], which in classical antiquity was centered in the hinterland of [[Durrës]].[18] When the Romans arrived in Illyria after their victory of the [[Illyrian Wars]], they populated and integrated the area into their empire under the political control of the city of Rome.
The oldest surviving discovery from this period is a [[Tirana Mosaic]] dating to the 3rd century, which was transformed into an [[Aisleless church]] with a mosaic floor.
A [[Fortress of Justinian]], possibly known as Tirkan, was built by the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] between the 4th and 6th century and later restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century.[19]
Tirana is mentioned in [[Republic of Venice]] documents in the 1350s as well as in 1418: "...the resident Pjeter, son of late Domenik from the village of Tirana...".[20] Records of the first land registrations under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1431–32 show that Tirana consisted of 60 inhabited areas, with nearly 2,028 houses and 7,300 inhabitants.[citation needed] In 1510, [[Marin Barleti]], an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero [[Skanderbeg]], Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis (The story of life and deeds of Skanderbeg, the prince of Epirotes), referred to this area as a small village, distinguishing between "Little Tirana" and "Great Tirana".[20] It is later mentioned in 1572 as Borgo di Tirana.[21]
According to [[Johann Georg von Hahn]], the settlement had already started to develop as a [[Bazaar]] and included several [[Watermill]],[22] even before 1614, when [[Sulejman Bargjini]], a local ruler, built the [[Sylejman Pasha Mosque]], a small commercial centre, and a [[Turkish bath]] (Turkish bath).
This is confirmed by oral sources, which state that there were two earlier mosques 300–400 m from the Old Mosque, towards today's [[Ali Demi Street]].
The Mosque of Reç and the Mosque of Mujo were positioned on the left side of the [[Lana river]] and were older than the Old Mosque.[22] Later, the [[Et'hem Bey Mosque]], built by [[Molla Bey of Petrela]], was constructed.
It employed the best [[Artisans]] in the country and was completed in 1821 by Molla's son [[Etëhem Bey Mollaj]], who was also Sulejman Bargjini's great-nephew.
In 1800, the first newcomers arrived in the [[Human settlement]][clarification needed], the so-called ortodoksit.
They were [[Aromanians]] from villages near [[Korçë]] and [[Pogradec]], who settled around modern day [[Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake]].[23] They started to be known as the llacifac and were the first Christians to arrive after the creation of the town.[24] In 1807, Tirana became the centre of the [[Subprefecture]] of Krujë-Tirana.[citation needed] After 1816, Tirana languished under the control of the Toptani family of [[Krujë]].[citation needed] Later, Tirana became a sub-prefecture of the newly created [[Vilayet of Shkodër]] and the Sanjak of Durrës.
In 1889, the [[Albanian language]] started to be taught in Tirana's schools,[citation needed] and the patriotic club Bashkimi was founded in 1908.
On 28 November 1912, the national flag was raised in [[Vlorë]] by [[President of Albania]] [[Ismail Qemali]], marking the symbolic birth of Albania as a sovereign country.
During the [[Balkan Wars]], Tirana was temporarily occupied by the Serbian army and it took part in uprising of the villages led by [[Haxhi Qamili]].
In August 1916, the first city map was compiled by the specialists of the Austro-Hungarian army.[25] Following the capture of the town of [[Debar]] by [[Kingdom of Serbia]], many of its Albanian inhabitants fled to [[Turkey]], the rest went to Tirana.[26] Of those that ended up in [[Istanbul]], some of their number migrated to Albania, mainly to Tirana where the Dibran community (people from [[Dibër County]]) formed an important segment of the city's population from 1920 onward and for some years thereafter.[26] On 8 February 1920, the [[Congress of Lushnjë]] proclaimed Tirana as the temporary capital of Albania, which had gained independence in 1912.[27] The city acquired that status permanently on 31 December 1925.
In 1923, the first regulatory city plan was compiled by Austrian architects.[28] The centre of Tirana was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and [[Armando Brasini]], well-known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy.
It was there that, in September 1928, [[Zog of Albania]] was crowned King Zog I, King of the Albanians.
Tirana was the venue for the signing of the Pact of Tirana between Fascist [[Italy]] and Albania.
During the rule of King Zog, many [[Muhaxhir (Albanians)]] migrated towards Tirana, which led to a growing population in the capital city in the early 20th century.[29]
In 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces, who appointed a [[Puppet government]].
In the meantime, Italian architect [[Gherardo Bosio]] was asked to elaborate on previous plans and introduce a new project in the area of present-day [[Mother Teresa Square (Tirana)]].[30] A failed assassination attempt was made on [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] by a local resistance activist during a visit to Tirana.
In November 1941, two emissaries of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ), Miladin Popović and Dušan Mugoša, called a meeting of three Albanian communist groups [citation needed] and founded the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], and [[Enver Hoxha]] soon emerged as its leader.
The town soon became the centre of the Albanian communists, who mobilised locals against Italian fascists and later [[Nazi]] Germans, while spreading ideological propaganda.
On 4 February 1944, the [[Gestapo]], supported by the forces of [[Xhafer Deva]], executed 86 anti-fascists in Tirana.[31] On 17 November 1944, the [[Liberation of Tirana]] after a [[Albanian Resistance of World War II]].[citation needed] The Nazis eventually withdrew and the communists seized power.
From 1944 to 1991, massive socialist-style apartment complexes and factories were built, while [[Skanderbeg Square]] was redesigned, with a number of buildings demolished.
For instance, Tirana's former Old Bazaar and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] Cathedral were razed to the ground in order to build the Soviet-styled Palace of Culture.
The northern portion of the main boulevard was renamed [[Joseph Stalin]] [[Zogu I Boulevard]] and his statue was erected in the city square.
After Hoxha's death, a [[Pyramid of Tirana]] was constructed in his memory by the government.[citation needed]
Before and after the proclamation of Albania's policy of self-imposed [[Isolationism]], a number of high-profile figures paid visits to the city, such as Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[People's Republic of China]] Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[German Democratic Republic]] Foreign Minister [[Oskar Fischer (politician)]].
In 1985, Enver Hoxha's funeral was held in Tirana.[32] A few years later, [[Mother Teresa]] became the first religious figure[33] to visit the country after the end of Albania's long [[Anti-religious]] [[State atheism]] stance.
Starting at the campus and ending at Skanderbeg Square with the toppling of Enver Hoxha's statue, the city saw [[Fall of communism in Albania]] by [[University of Tirana]] students demanding political freedoms in the early 1990s.
Personalities visited the capital, such as former U.S. Secretary of State [[James Baker]] and [[Pope John Paul II]].
During the Balkans turmoil in the mid-1990s, the city experienced dramatic events such as the unfolding of the [[1997 unrest in Albania]] and a [[Fatos Nano#Second and third premierships]] on 14 September 1998.
In 1999, following the [[Kosovo War]], Tirana Airport became a NATO airbase, serving its mission in the former Yugoslavia.
During his term from 2000 to 2011, the former [[Mayor of Tirana]], [[Edi Rama]], undertook a campaign to demolish illegal constructed buildings across Tirana as well as along the river banks of [[Lanë]] to bring the area to its pre-1990 state.
Most main roads underwent reconstruction, including the Unaza, [[Kavaja Street]] and the main boulevard.
Bush]] traveled to Tirana on an official state visit, becoming the first [[U.S. President]] to visit the former communist country.[37][38] In 2008, the [[2008 Gërdec explosions]] were felt in the capital as windows were shattered and citizens shaken.
In January 2011, the [[2011 Albanian opposition demonstrations]] were triggered in front of the governmental buildings in Tirana protesting against political corruption and state capture, particularly associated with the former prime minister [[Sali Berisha]]'s government.[39] In September 2014, [[Pope Francis]] made an official state visit to Tirana simultaneously becoming the second pontiff to visit Albania, after Pope John Paul II in 1992.[40][41]
Following the municipal elections of 2015, power was transferred from the [[Democratic Party of Albania]] representative [[Lulzim Basha]] to the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] candidate [[Erion Veliaj]].[42] Albania then underwent a territorial reform, in which defunct communes were merged with municipalities.[43] Thirteen of Tirana's former communes were integrated as administrative units joining the existing eleven.[44]
Since then, Tirana is undergoing significant changes in infrastructure, law enforcement and new projects, as well as continuing the ones started by Veliaj's predecessor.
Between December 2018 and February 2019, a [[2018–2019 student protest in Albania]] erupted in the central areas of Tirana and other cities of the country in response to a controversial law on higher education, poor quality of teaching, high tuition rates and corruption.[46][47][48] In September 2019, Tirana was ravaged by a 5.6 [[Moment magnitude scale]] [[Earthquake]] with an epicenter located near Durrës.[49][50][51] Two months after, in November 2019, another strong [[2019 Albania earthquake]] with the magnitude of 6.4 hit the region again resulting in comparatively few damages in Tirana.[52] The same month, Tirana was announced as the [[European Youth Capital]] for 2022 with a planned program including events of cultural and social importance.[53]
In December 2022, Tirana hosted the [[2022 EU-Western Balkans summit]], marking the inaugural summit to be held outside the European Union's borders.[54] On 21 September 2024, it was reported that [[Prime Minister of Albania]] [[Edi Rama]] was planning to create the [[Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order]], a sovereign [[Microstate]] for the Order within Tirana.[55]
Tirana extends at the [[Tirana plain]] in the centre of Albania between the mount of [[Dajti]] in the east, the hills of Kërrabe, Sauk and Vaqarr in the south, and a valley to the north overlooking the [[Adriatic Sea]].
The average altitude is about 110 meters (360 ft) [[Above sea level]], with a maximum of 1,828 metres (5,997 feet) at Maja Mincekut of Mali me Gropa in Shenmeri.[56]
The city is surrounded by two important [[Protected areas of Albania]]: the [[Dajti National Park]] and [[Mali me Gropa-Bizë-Martanesh Protected Landscape]].
In terms of [[Biodiversity]], the forests are mainly composed of [[Pine]], [[Oak]] and [[Beech]], while its interior relief[clarification needed] is dotted with [[Canyon]], waterfalls, caves, lakes and other landforms.[57] Thanks to its natural heritage, it is considered the "Natural Balcony of Tirana".
[[Tiranë (river)]] flows through the city, as does the Lanë river.
Tirana is home to several artificial lakes, including [[Grand Park of Tirana]], Farka, Tufina, and Kashar.
Tirana has a [[Humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] and receives enough [[Precipitation]] during summer to avoid the [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) classification.
In terms of precipitation, both rain and snow, the city is ranked among the wettest cities in [[Europe]].[59]
[[Spring (season)]] and [[Summer (season)]] are very warm to hot often reaching over 20 °C (68 °F) from May to September.
During [[Autumn]] and [[Winter (season)]], from November to March, the average temperature drops and is not lower than 6.7 °C (44.1 °F).
The city suffers from problems such as [[Waste management]], high levels of [[Air pollution]] and significant [[Noise pollution]].
These are mostly 1990s and early 2000s [[Diesel engine]] cars,[68] while it is widely believed that the [[Fuel]] used in Albania contains larger amounts of [[Sulfur]] and [[Lead]] than in the [[European Union]].
Another source of pollution are PM10 and PM2.5 [[Atmospheric particulate matter]] and [[Nitrogen dioxide]] gases[69][70] resulting from rapid growth in the construction of new buildings and expanding road infrastructure.[71]
Untreated [[Solid waste]] is present in the city and outskirts.
Works for four new large parks have started in the summer of 2015 located in Kashar, [[Farka Lake]], Vaqarr, and [[Dajti Mountain]].

It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the [[Government of Albania]].
The historical core of the capital lies around pedestrian only Murat Toptani Street, while the most prominent city district is [[Blloku]].
Tirana is the [[Capital city]] of the [[Republic of Albania]] thus playing an essential role in shaping the political and economic life of the country.[78] It is the home to government functions and institutions for which the government of Albania is responsible, as for instance the [[Executive (government)]], [[Judiciary]] and [[Legislative]] branches of Albania.
The President and [[Prime Minister of Albania]] officially reside and work in Tirana specifically at the [[Presidential Office Building, Tirana]] and [[Prime Minister's Office (Albania)]], respectively, nevertheless the [[Parliament of Albania]] is headquartered at the [[Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard]].[79][80][81] Tirana is also the home to the national [[Constitutional Court of Albania]] and [[Supreme Court of Albania]].
Important national institutions housed in Tirana include the [[Appeals courts of Albania]] and [[Administrative Courts in Albania]].
The [[Bank of Albania]] is located at the Skanderbeg Square while other institutions such as the ministries of [[Ministry of Culture (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Finance and Economy (Albania)]], [[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Health and Social Protection]], [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Albania)]], [[Ministry of Justice (Albania)]] and [[Ministry of Tourism and Environment (Albania)]] are spread over Tirana.

Tirana is the heart of the [[Economy of Albania]] and the most [[Industrialised]] and economically fastest growing region in Albania.
Of the main [[Sector (economy)]], the [[Tertiary sector]] is the most important for the economy of Tirana and employs more than 68% of work force of Tirana.[94] 26% of the working population makes up the [[Secondary sector]] followed by the [[Primary sector]] with only 5%.[94]
Forming the financial centre of the country, the [[Financial industry]] is a major component of the city's tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to [[Privatization]] and the commendable [[Monetary policy]].[96] All of the most important financial institutions, such as the Bank of Albania and the [[Albanian Stock Exchange]] are centred in Tirana as well as most of the [[List of banks in Albania]] such as the [[Banka Kombëtare Tregtare]], [[Raiffeisen (Albania)]], [[Credins Bank]], [[Intesa Sanpaolo Bank (Albania)]] and [[Tirana Bank]].
The [[Telecommunication industry]] represents another major and growing contributor to the sector.[97] A rapid development occurred as well as after the end of communism and decades of isolationism mainly due to the new national policy of reform and opening up sped up the industry's development.
[[Vodafone Albania]], [[Telekom Albania]] and [[Eagle Mobile]] are the leading telecommunication providers in Tirana, as in all the country.
The [[Tourism industry]] of the city has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the economy.[98] Tirana has been officially dubbed as 'The Place Beyond Belief' by local authorities.[99] The increasing number of international arrivals at the [[Tirana International Airport]] and [[Port of Durrës]] from across Europe, Australia and Asia has rapidly grown the number of foreign visitors in the city.[100][101]
The largest hotels of the city are the [[Tirana International Hotel]], [[TID Tower]] both situated in the heart of the city near Skanderbeg Square, and the Hyatt-owned luxury Mak Hotel Tirana[102] located next to the [[Arena Kombëtare]], where Mariott Tirana Hotel is also planned to open.[103] Other major hotels present in central Tirana include the Rogner Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn Tirana, Xheko Imperial Hotel, Best Western Premier Ark Hotel, and Mondial Hotel.
Tirana is served by [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]], which is simultaneously the premier air gateway to the country.
The airport carried more than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 and is also the principal [[Airline hub]] for the country's [[Flag carrier]], [[Air Albania]].[104]
The city's geographical location in the centre of Albania has long established the city as an integral terminus for the [[Roads in Albania]], thus connecting the city to all parts of Albania and the neighbouring countries.[105] The [[SH 1 (Albania)]] (SH1) connects Tirana with [[Shkodër]] and [[Montenegro]] in the north, and constitutes an essential section of the proposed [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]].
The [[SH 2 (Albania)]] (SH2) continues in the west and provides direct connection to Durrës on the Adriatic Sea.
The Rruga Shtetërore 3 (SH3) is being transformed to the [[A3 (Albania)]] (A3) and follows the ancient [[Via Egnatia]].
It significantly constitutes a major section of the [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]] and links the city with [[Elbasan]], Korçë and Greece in the south.
Tirana is further connected, through the Milot interchange in the northwest, with [[Kosovo]] following as part of the [[A1 motorway (Albania)]] (A1).
During the [[Communism in Albania]], a plan for the construction of a [[Ring road]] around Tirana arose in 1989 with no implementation until the 2010s.[106] It is of major importance, especially concerning the demographic growth of the [[Metropolitan region]] of Tirana as well as the importance of the economy.
Rail lines of [[Hekurudha Shqiptare]] (HSH) connected Tirana with all of the major cities of Albania, including Durrës, Shkodër and Vlorë.
In 2013, the [[Tirana Railway Station]] was closed and moved to Kashar by the city government in order to create space for the New Boulevard ([[Albanian language]]: Bulevardi i Ri) project.[108] The new Tirana Station will be constructed in [[Laprakë]], which is projected to be a multifunctional terminal for rail, tram and bus transportation.[109][110] City officials have also talked about a light rail extension all the way to the location of the former rail station.[111]
The new rail line from Tirana through Nënë Tereza International Airport to Durrës has started construction.[111]
The entire network had an average [[Headway]] of 9 minutes on a daily basis in 2018 and in the first half of 2019.[112]
During the administration of mayor Erion Veliaj, the government of Tirana has significantly increased the creation and expansion of a [[Cycling infrastructure]] in the city in order to reduce [[Traffic congestion]] as well as to improve the [[Sustainable transport]].[113][114][115] [[Ecovolis]] was launched in 2011 offering rental services for [[Bicycle]] at different centrally located stations for a small fee.[116][117] The international [[Bicycle sharing system]], [[Mobike]], launched its operations on 8 June 2018 by deploying 4000 bicycles in the city.[118][119] Both services were discontinued.
Tirana has the highest concentration of institutions of [[Tertiary education]] in Albania, consisting of numerous [[Academy]], [[College]] and [[Universities]].
Most prominent among these is the University of Tirana with campuses around the city and more than 28,000 students from all backgrounds.[120] The [[Polytechnic University of Tirana]] is another distinguished institution and also the most renowned engineering and technical university in the country.
The four other public institutions in Tirana are the [[University of Arts (Albania)]], [[Agricultural University of Tirana]], [[University of Medicine, Tirana]] and [[Sports University of Tirana]].[120]
The educational system of Tirana has expanded substantially over the past years with the renovations of existing school facilities and the construction of new schools.[121][122] For [[Primary education]] and [[Secondary education]] education, a variety of schools are available, tagged with the public, private and international labels.
Some of the international schools are the [[Tirana International School]], [[Albanian International School]], British School, Montessori School, Memorial School and World Academy.

In Albania, a [[Secular state]] with no [[State religion]], the freedom of [[Freedom of belief]], [[Freedom of conscience]] and [[Freedom of religion]] is explicitly guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Albania]].[137][138] Tirana is religiously diverse and has many places of worship catering to its religious population whom are adherents of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] but also of [[Atheism]] and [[Agnosticism]].
Nevertheless, the [[Bektashi Order]] leadership established their world centre also in the city.
