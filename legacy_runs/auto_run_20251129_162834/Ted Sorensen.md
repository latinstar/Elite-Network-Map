He helped draft the [[Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States]] in which Kennedy said famously, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Although Sorensen played an important part in the composition of the inaugural address, he has stated that "the speech and its famous turn of phrase that everyone remembers was written by Kennedy himself."[8][9] In his 2008 memoir, Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History, Sorensen claimed, "The truth is that I simply don't remember where the line came from."[10]

Sorensen's help with explaining [[Ted Kennedy]]'s [[Chappaquiddick incident]] and Sorensen's mishandling of classified information were cited as factors of Senate opposition to his nomination.[15] Sorensen in his autobiography attributed the loss of Senate support for his nomination for CIA director to his [[Conscientious objector]] status as a youth, his two failed marriages, and his writing an affidavit in defense of releasing [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s [[Pentagon Papers]].[16]
Sorensen was the national co-chairman for [[Gary Hart]] for the [[1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries]] and made several appearances on his behalf.[17]
