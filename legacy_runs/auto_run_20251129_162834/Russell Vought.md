Russell Thurlow Vought (/voʊt/ VOHT; born March 26, 1976) is an American government official and conservative political analyst who has served as the 44th director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) since February 2025.
Concurrently, he is the acting director of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) and the acting director of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).
Vought founded the think tank Center for Renewing America, played a significant role in [[Project 2025]],[1] and served as policy director of the [[Republican National Committee]]'s platform committee.
In August 2025, Vought took charge of the USAID closeout after it was folded into the [[U.S. Department of State]].
He opposes the status quo and calls his opposition [[Marxist]].
He considers himself and allies to be radical constitutionalists who advocate for intensified presidential power[2]—views that include ending the independence of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and annihilating the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].[3]
Vought was born to Thurlow Bunyea Vought, an electrician and [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran, and Margaret Flowers Vought, an elementary school teacher, and grew up in [[Trumbull, Connecticut]].[4][5][6] He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Wheaton College (Illinois)]] in [[Wheaton, Illinois]], in 1998 and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[George Washington University Law School]] in 2004.[7][8]
Vought served as vice president of [[Heritage Action]], the lobbying arm of the [[The Heritage Foundation]].[9][10][11] He was the executive director and budget director of the [[Republican Study Committee]]; the policy director for the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives]]; and a legislative assistant, beginning in the mailroom,[12] for U.S. Senator [[Phil Gramm]].[13][14]
Vought is a [[Deacon]] of the [[Baptist]] church.[12] Until he entered politics he had planned to attend seminary to become a pastor.[2]
In April 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] nominated Vought to be deputy director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).[15] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 28, 2018, in a 50–49 vote.
Vice President [[Mike Pence]] cast the [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by the vice president of the United States]].[16]
During the confirmation hearings, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] questioned him about Vought's blog post that, "Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology.
They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned."[17][18] Various Christian organizations denounced Sanders's questioning as a violation of the [[No Religious Test Clause]],[18] and [[Emma Green (journalist)]] wrote for The Atlantic that Sanders' questioning "flirted with the boundaries" of the clause.[19]
In 2019, Vought defied a subpoena to testify before Congress in relation to the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]] and the administration's decision to freeze military aid to Ukraine.[20] The decision to freeze aid to Ukraine had led Democrats to launch [[First impeachment of Donald Trump]].[21]
On January 2, 2019, Vought assumed OMB operations and became acting director, as [[Mick Mulvaney]] retained the director position after he became [[White House Chief of Staff]].[22] On March 18, 2020, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Vought to serve as permanent OMB director.[23] Vought was confirmed in July with a U.S. Senate vote of 51–45[24] and sworn in on July 22, 2020.[25]
In May 2020, Vought elected to break the OMB's long-standing practice of publishing updated [[Economic forecasting]], citing disruption caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].[21]
In September at President Trump's direction, Vought published an OMB memo[26] instructing federal agencies to stop all training on "[[Critical race theory]]" or "white privilege", along with "any other training or propaganda effort that teaches or suggests either (1) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country or (2) that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil".
After [[Joe Biden]] won the [[2020 United States presidential election]] and Trump alleged that the election had been stolen, Biden's transition team accused Vought of hindering the presidential transition by refusing to allow incoming Biden officials to meet with OMB staff.[28] Typically, career OMB staff would provide an incoming administration with cost estimates and details on existing programs.[28] Vought defended his actions, stating that OMB had provided funding for the transition and that there had been more than 45 meetings with Biden officials but that "OMB staff are working on this administration's policies and will do so until this administration's final day in office".[29]
In December 2020, Donald Trump appointed Vought to the Board of Visitors of the [[United States Naval Academy]].
Vought and [[Sean Spicer]] (appointed by Trump to the Naval board in 2019 and likewise fired by Biden) sued to prevent their removal, arguing that their appointments were to three-year terms.[30]  Federal judge [[Dabney Friedrich]] dismissed the suit in July 2022.[31]
In January 2021, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America (CRA), a think tank focused on combating [[Critical race theory]].
CRA has an affiliated issue advocacy group, American Restoration Action.[32][failed verification] The mission of the groups is to "renew a consensus of America as a nation under God".[33] The think tank is aimed at countering progressive social values, promoting an "[[America First]]" policy agenda, addressing border security and immigration, and reforming the federal bureaucracy.[34] According to [[Axios (website)]], the groups "will provide the ideological ammunition to sustain Trump's political movement after his departure from the White House."[35] At CRA, Vought organized more than 350 executive orders and regulations to be ready for the case of a Republican presidency.[2]
In April, [[The Washington Post]] fact-checker rated Vought's statement that only 5 to 7 percent of the Biden administration's [[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]] would go to "actual roads and bridges and ports and things that you and I would say is real infrastructure" as inaccurate to the degree of "Three Pinocchios" out of four.[36]
In June, Citizens for Renewing America, the advocacy arm of Center for Renewing America, released a guide to "combatting [[Critical race theory]]."[37] Vought told [[Fox News]] the 33-page handbook is "a crash course in CRT, a 'one-stop shopping' for parents trying to hold their school board members accountable."[38]

In June 2022, Vought confirmed that federal agents conducted a search of the home of his organization's director of litigation, [[Jeffrey Clark]], a former U.S. Department of Justice official who participated in [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election]].[42]
In October 2024, [[ProPublica]] reported on speeches Vought had made at Center for Renewing America events.
According to the report, Vought's proposals included plans to reshape government by using military force against protesters if deemed necessary, to defund agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] for the purpose of reducing federal influence, and to cast civil servants as obstructive to conservative agendas.
Vought played a major role in the creation of [[Project 2025]], a collection of [[Conservatism in the United States]] and [[Right-wing politics]] policy proposals from [[The Heritage Foundation]] to reshape the [[Federal government of the United States]] and consolidate [[Executive (government)]].[44][45] The Center for Renewing America was listed as a member of the Project 2025 advisory board.[46] Project 2025 includes proposals to [[Schedule F appointment]] tens of thousands of merit-based [[United States federal civil service]] workers as [[Political appointments in the United States]] in order to replace them with Trump loyalists,[47][48] which was outlined in the 920-page Mandate for Project 2025, published in April 2023.[49]
Vought was often discussed as a candidate for [[White House chief of staff]].[50]
Nearly half of the organizations collaborating in the project received [[Dark money]] from a network of fundraising groups.[51] The project seeks to infuse the government and society with [[Christian values]].[50][52]
The [[Centre for Climate Reporting]] published an interview with Vought with two of its journalists posing as relatives of a potential donor in August 2024.
He called for banning pornography, acknowledging that an outright ban would be unpopular with the public, and instead supporting laws that would make pornography websites legally liable if used by minors.[53] He also stated the president is not bound by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which prevents federal troops from conducting civilian law enforcement.
The confidential plans were secretive to avoid the press and the [[Freedom of Information Act]].[41]
Vought was named policy director of the [[Republican National Committee]] platform committee in May 2024.[55]
On November 23, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would renominate Vought as director of the OMB for his second term as president.[56] Vought appeared before the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on January 15, 2025.
During his confirmation hearing, Vought did not commit to spending all the money assigned by the Congress to the federal government.[57] The committee advanced his nomination in an 8–7 vote on January 20, 2025.[58] He later appeared before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget]] on January 22, 2025.[59] The committee approved his nomination in an 11–0 vote (with all 9 Democrats and 1 Independent boycotting the committee vote due to January 2025 federal spending freeze).[60] The U.S. Senate confirmed Vought's nomination on February 6 with a 53–47 vote.[61] On February 7, Vought was sworn in by United States Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].
At OMB, he guided much of [[Department of Government Efficiency]] effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.[2]
His confirmation became a cause célèbre at his alma mater, the evangelical Christian [[Wheaton College (Illinois)]].
Wheaton said the thousands of comments seemed to be mainly "incendiary, unchristian".[62] Some alumni worked for [[USAID]] or other agencies the Trump administration had closed down,[62] and three days later, a group of fifteen alumni reacted in an open letter opposing Vought’s work on Project 2025 and calling out Vought's views as "antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to the mission of Wheaton College".[62] Wheaton, which self-identifies as "deliberately non-partisan",[63] deleted its post.[62] On February 17, several hundred alumni signed a different open letter accusing the school of capitulating to anti-conservative views.[63] Billy Graham's son [[Franklin Graham]] joined in on Facebook with "Shame on them for backing down".[62]
Upon taking office as OMB director, Vought was also installed as acting director of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].[66] In his first month at the CFPB, the CFPB dropped at least a half dozen cases brought by Vought's predecessor, [[Rohit Chopra]].[67] In May 2025, the CFPB rescinded a rule that limited the ability of [[Data broker]] to sell sensitive information, such as financial data, credit history, and Social Security numbers.[68]
On June 25, Vought told a Senate committee that the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), a global anti-AIDS initiative, had spent $9.3 million funding abortions and "[[Gender analysis]]" in Russia, a claim which The New York Times found to be false.
On July 15, 2025, Vought said that the White House was on board with an amendment that would exempt the PEPFAR from budget cuts.[69] A $400 million proposed cut to PEPFAR was subsequently removed from the rescission package by [[Senate Republican Conference]].[70][71][69]
On October 2, 2025, a day after the start of the [[2025 United States federal government shutdown]], President Trump posted on [[Truth Social]] one AI-generated video parody of the [[Blue Oyster Cult]]'s [[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]] song starring Vought as the scythe-wielding [[Grim Reaper]], with lyrics declaring that "Russ Vought is the reaper.
He wields the pen, the funds and the brain."[72] On October 10, Vought wrote on [[Twitter]] that "The RIFs [reductions-in-force] have begun," referring to federal worker [[Layoff]] confirmed by a spokesperson to be substantial and permanent rather than temporary.[73]
He wrote in 2022 that he commits to the institutional [[Separation of church and state in the United States]], and, at the same time, integration of Christian influence with government and society.[74] In a secretly recorded meeting in 2024, Vought said that conservatives should discuss whether to prioritize Christian immigrants over those of other religions.[54]
Vought supports a total ban on [[Abortion]].
He has called the [[Democratic Party (United States)]] "increasingly evil" for supporting [[Secularism]].[33] In 2022,[75] Vought began advocating for "radical [[Constitutionalism]]" to reverse a current "post-Constitutional time"; he says this has been the result of a century of corruption of laws and institutions by the political left.
He characterizes the federal bureaucracy as "[[Woke]] and weaponized" and advocates replacing it with "radical constitutionalists".[33][74] Vought proposes to "gut the FBI" and end the tradition of political independence of the [[United States Justice Department]].[74][50]
Vought was previously married to Mary Grace Vought, with whom he has two daughters, one of whom has [[Cystic fibrosis]].[78][8] Mary filed for divorce on August 4, 2023, and the divorce was finalized on August 30 in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].[79]
