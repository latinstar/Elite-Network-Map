Brazil,[b] officially the Federative Republic of Brazil,[c] is the largest country in [[South America]].
It is also the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population]], with over 213 million people.
The country is a [[Federation]] composed of 26 [[Federative units of Brazil]] and a [[Federal District (Brazil)]], which hosts the capital, [[Brasília]].
[[List of cities in Brazil by population]] is [[São Paulo]], followed by [[Rio de Janeiro]].
Brazil has the most [[Portuguese-speaking countries]] in the world and is the only country in the [[Americas]] where [[Portuguese language]] is an [[Portuguese-speaking world]].[11][12]
Bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the east, Brazil has a [[Coastline of Brazil]] of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi).[13] Covering roughly half of South America's land area, it [[Borders of Brazil]] on the continent except [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]].[14] Brazil encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, as well as [[Pantanal]], [[Cerrado]], [[Brazilian Highlands]], and low mountains.
It contains most of the [[Amazon basin]], including the [[Amazon River]] and most extensive [[Old-growth forest]] [[Amazon rainforest]].
Brazil has diverse [[Wildlife of Brazil]], a variety of [[Environment of Brazil]], and extensive natural resources spanning numerous [[Protected areas of Brazil]].[13] The country ranks first among 17 [[Megadiverse countries]], with its natural heritage being the subject of significant global interest, as [[Environmental degradation]] (through processes such as [[Deforestation in Brazil]]) directly affect global issues such as [[Climate change in Brazil]] and [[Biodiversity loss]].
Brazil was inhabited by [[Pre-Cabraline history of Brazil]] prior to the [[Discovery of Brazil]] of Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in 1500.
It was claimed and settled by [[Portuguese Empire]], which imported [[Slavery in Brazil]] to work on [[Brazilian sugar cycle]].
Brazil remained a [[Colonial Brazil]] until 1815, when it was elevated to the rank of a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] after the [[Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil]].
Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil]] declared the country's [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822 and, after waging a [[Brazilian War of Independence]], established the [[Empire of Brazil]].
Brazil's [[Brazilian Constitution of 1824]] established a bicameral legislature, now called the [[Brazilian National Congress]], and enshrined principles such as freedom of religion and the press, but retained slavery, which was [[Abolitionism in Brazil]] throughout the 19th century until its [[Lei Áurea]].
Brazil became a [[First Brazilian Republic]] following a [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)]] in 1889.
An [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]] put an end to the First Republic and brought [[Getúlio Vargas]] to power.
While initially committing to democratic governance, Vargas assumed dictatorial powers following a [[1937 Brazilian coup d'état]], marking the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)]], in which he oversaw [[Brazil in World War II]].
Democracy was restored after [[1945 Brazilian coup d'état]].
An authoritarian [[Military dictatorship in Brazil]] emerged [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]] with support from the [[United States]] and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed.
Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil]], enacted in 1988, defines it as a [[Democracy]] [[Federal republic]].[15]
Brazil is a [[Regional power]] and [[Middle power]],[16][17][18] and has been described as a [[Emerging power]].[19][20][21][22] It is an [[Emerging market]],[23][24] [[Developing country]] economy and [[Newly industrialized country]],[25] with one of the 10 [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]] in the world in both nominal and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)]] terms,[7][26] the largest economy in [[Latin America]] and the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the [[List of countries by total wealth]] in South America.
With a [[Economic Complexity Index]] and highly diversified economy, Brazil is one of the world's major or primary exporters of various [[Agriculture in Brazil]], [[Mining in Brazil]], and [[Industry in Brazil]].[27] The country ranks [[List of World Heritage Sites in Brazil]] by number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].[28] Brazil is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], the [[G20]], [[BRICS]], [[G4 nations]], [[Mercosur]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]; it is also an observer state of the [[Arab League]] and a [[Major non-NATO ally]] of the United States.[29][30]
The word Brazil probably comes from the Portuguese word for [[Paubrasilia]], a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.[31] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology 'red like an [[Ember]]', formed from brasa ('ember') and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium).[32] It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant.[33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.[34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]] (mostly [[Tupi people]]) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders in return for assorted European consumer goods.[35]
Some early sailors called it the 'Land of Parrots'.[38] In the [[Guarani language]], Brazil is called Pindorama, meaning 'land of the palm trees'.[39]
Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, [[Luzia Woman]], were found in the area of [[Pedro Leopoldo]], [[Minas Gerais]], and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.[41] The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and [[Radiocarbon dating]] to over 8,000 years ago (6000 BC).
The pottery was found near [[Santarém, Pará]] and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture.[42] The [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó]] in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, [[Social stratification]], large populations, [[Mound building]], and complex social formations such as [[Chiefdom]].[43]
The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, [[Guaraní people]], [[Gê peoples]], and [[Arawak peoples]]).
The Tupi people were subdivided into the [[Tupiniquim]] and [[Tupinambá people]].[45]
Before the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.[46] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with [[Human cannibalism]] rituals on prisoners of war.[47][48] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions.[46] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into [[Kinship]] relations.[49]
Following the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the land now called Brazil was claimed for the [[Portuguese Empire]] on 22 April 1500, with [[Discovery of Brazil]].[51] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi–Guaraní]] family and fought among themselves.[52] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King [[John III of Portugal]] divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous [[Captaincies of Brazil]].[53][54]
However, the decentralized and unorganized captaincy system proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the [[Governorate General of Brazil]] in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.[54][55] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.[56][57][58][59]
By the mid-16th century, [[Sugar#Sugarcane]] had become [[Brazilian sugar cycle]],[52][60] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the [[Slavery in Africa#Atlantic slave trade]][61] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), had become its largest import,[62][63] to cope with [[Engenho]], due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.[64][65] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800.[66]
By the end of the 17th century, sugar exports began to decline[67] and the discovery of gold by [[Bandeirantes]] in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a [[Brazilian Gold Rush]][68] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world.[69] This increased level of immigration in turn caused [[War of the Emboabas]] between newcomers and old settlers.[70]
Portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually [[Uti possidetis#The Brazilian frontier movement into Spanish-claimed lands]] in South America to its approximately current borders.[71][72] In this era, other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French [[France Antarctique]], [[Equinoctial France]], and the [[Dutch invasions of Brazil]], during the [[Dutch–Portuguese War]], after the end of [[Iberian Union]].[73]
The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the [[Palmares (quilombo)]],[74] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the [[Inconfidência Mineira]].[75]
In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[Continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal]], in the name of [[Maria I of Portugal]], to [[Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil]] from [[Lisbon]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]].[76] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[Stock exchange]][77] and its [[Banco do Brasil]], additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations.
In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the [[Portuguese conquest of French Guiana]].[78]
With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony.
In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[Pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state.[79] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]]).
In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of [[Porto]],[80] John VI departed for Lisbon.
There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]], as Regent of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]].[81]
Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the [[Portuguese Cortes]], guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[82] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to side with them, [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence]] on 7 September 1822.[83] A month later, Prince Pedro was proclaimed the first [[Emperor of Brazil]], with the royal title of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil]], resulting in the founding of the [[Empire of Brazil]].[84]
The [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the [[Cisplatina]] province.[85] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[86] Portugal [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)]] Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[87]
On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberals and conservatives, including an attempt of [[Confederation of the Equator]][88] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro I departed for Portugal to [[Liberal Wars]] after [[Abdication of Pedro I of Brazil]] in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil]]).[89]
As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a [[Regency period (Empire of Brazil)]] was set up by the [[General Assembly (Brazil)]].[90] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the [[Cabanagem]] in [[Grão-Pará Province]], the [[Malê Revolt]] in Salvador, the [[Balaiada]] ([[Maranhão]]), the [[Sabinada]] ([[Bahia]]), and the [[Ragamuffin War]], which began in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and was supported by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].
These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.[91] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the [[Praieira revolt]] in [[Pernambuco]], was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the [[Dom Pedro II#Early coronation]] in 1841.[92]
The [[Atlantic slave trade to Brazil]] was outlawed in 1850,[93] as a result of the British [[Aberdeen Act]] and the [[Eusébio de Queirós Law]], but only in May 1888, after a long process of [[Abolitionism in Brazil]] for an ethical and legal dismantling of [[Slavery in Brazil]], was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the [[Lei Áurea]].[94]
The foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues pertaining Brazil's neighboring countries in the [[Southern Cone]].
Long after the [[Cisplatine War]] that resulted in the independence of [[Uruguay]],[95] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II: the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the devastating [[Paraguayan War]], the largest war effort in Brazilian history.[96][97]
Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[98] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the [[Imperial Brazilian Army]] officers, as well as with rural and financial elites, the monarchy was overthrown by a [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)]].[99] A few days later, the [[Flag of Brazil]] was replaced with a new design that included the national motto "Ordem e Progresso", influenced by [[Positivism]].
15 November is now [[Republic Day]], a national holiday.[100]
The [[Republic of the Sword]] was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states.
Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.[101] Not until 1894, following an [[Encilhamento]] and [[Revolta da Armada]], did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.[102][103][104]
In this first republican period, Brazil maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[105] only broken by the [[Acre War]] (1899–1902) and [[Brazil during World War I]] in [[World War I]] (1914–1918),[106][107][108] followed by a [[Presidency of Artur Bernardes#Withdrawal from the League of Nations]] in the [[League of Nations]];[109] Internally, from the crisis of Encilhamento[110][111][112] and the [[Revolta da Armada]],[113] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[114][115][116] and military.[117][118][119]
Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil#1st Republican period (1889–1930)]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]], supported by most of the military, successfully led the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]].[120][121] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.[122][123]
The first was the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in 1932, led by São Paulo's oligarchy.
The second was a [[Brazilian uprising of 1935]] in November 1935, and the last one a [[Integralist Uprising]] attempt by [[Brazilian Integralist Action]] in May 1938.[124][125][126] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch.
The [[1937 Brazilian coup d'état]] resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)]] era.
During [[World War II]], Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered [[Submarine warfare#Atlantic ocean]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Italy under fascism]] in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, [[Brazil in World War II]] on the [[Allies of World War II]].[128][129][130] In addition to [[Battle of the Atlantic#South Atlantic (May 1942 – September 1943)]], Brazil also sent an [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] to fight in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)]].[131]
With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas' position became untenable, and he was [[1945 Brazilian coup d'état]] in another military coup, with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[132] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[133][134]
Several brief interim governments followed Vargas' suicide.[135] [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory stance towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.[136] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[137] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]], inaugurated in 1960.[138] Kubitschek's successor, [[Jânio Quadros]], resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.[139] His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition[140] and was [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]] by a coup that resulted in a [[Military dictatorship in Brazil]].[141]
The new regime was intended to be transitory,[142] but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the [[AI-5]] in 1968.[143] Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to [[Armed struggle against the Brazilian military dictatorship]], but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,[144][145] inside and outside the country through "[[Operation Condor]]".[146][147] Like other [[Authoritarianism]], due to an economic boom, known as the "[[Brazilian Miracle]]", the Brazilian military dictatorship reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.[148]
Slowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas.[149] The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made a redemocratization policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals [[Ernesto Geisel]] and [[Golbery do Couto e Silva]].[150] With the enactment of the [[Amnesty law#Brazil]] in 1979, Brazil began a slow [[Redemocratization in Brazil]], which was completed during the 1980s.[92]
Civilians returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency.
He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and [[Hyperinflation]] he inherited from the military regime.[151] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989]] of the almost-unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], who was subsequently [[Impeachment of Fernando Collor de Mello]] in 1992.[152] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] as Minister of Finance.
In 1994, Cardoso devised a highly successful [[Plano Real]] that,[153] after decades of [[Timeline of Brazilian economic stabilization plans]] made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[154][155] Cardoso won the [[1994 Brazilian general election]], and [[1998 Brazilian general election]].[156]
The [[Peaceful transition of power]] from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] ([[Brazilian presidential election, 2002]] and [[Brazilian presidential election, 2006]]), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.[157][158] However, sparked by discontent accumulated over decades from corruption, [[Police brutality by country#Brazil]], inefficiencies of the political [[The Establishment]] and [[Public service]], [[2013 protests in Brazil]] erupted in Brazil in the middle of the first term of [[Dilma Rousseff]], who had succeeded Lula after winning election [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010]] and again [[Brazilian presidential election, 2014]] by narrow margins.[159][160]
Rousseff [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] by the [[Brazilian Congress]] in 2016, halfway into her second term,[161][162] and replaced by her vice-president [[Michel Temer]], who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August.
Large street [[2015–16 protests in Brazil]] took place during the impeachment process.[163] The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties.
In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President [[Michel Temer]]'s cabinet who were allegedly linked to the [[Operation Car Wash]].[164] President Temer himself was also accused of [[Corruption in Brazil]].[165]
In the fiercely contested [[2018 Brazilian general election]], the controversial conservative candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] of the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)]] (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round against [[Fernando Haddad]], of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.[166] In the early 2020s, Brazil became [[COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.[167] In May 2021, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] stated that he would run for a third term in the [[2022 Brazilian general election]] against Bolsonaro.[168] In October 2022, Lula was in first place in the first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round.[169][170] On 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters [[2023 Brazilian Congress attack]] in the capital, [[Brasília]], after several weeks of unrest.[171][172]
Brazil occupies nearly half of the land area of South America (47.7%), including a large area along its eastern coast and much of the continent's interior.[173] It borders [[Uruguay]] to the south; [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] to the southwest; [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] to the west; [[Colombia]] to the northwest; and [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and France (French overseas region of [[French Guiana]]) to the north.
It shares a border with every South American country except [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]].[13]
The Brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], and the islands of [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]].[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[173] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north]] and [[34th parallel south]], and longitudes [[28th meridian west]] and [[74th meridian west]].[13]
Brazil is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area]] country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,515,767.049 km2 (3,287,956 sq mi),[174] including 55,455 km2 (21,411 sq mi) of water.
Brazil is the only country in the world that has the [[Equator]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] running through it.[13] It spans four [[Time zone]]; from [[UTC-05]] comprising the state of [[Acre (state)]] and the westernmost portion of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)]], to [[UTC−04]] in the western states, to [[UTC−03]] in the eastern states (the [[Time in Brazil]]) and [[UTC−02]] in the [[List of islands of Brazil]].[175]
The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.[13] According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: [[Desert climate]], [[Tropical rainforest climate]], [[Tropical climate]], [[Semi-arid climate]], [[Oceanic climate]] and [[Humid subtropical climate]].
The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to [[Temperate coniferous forest]] in the south and [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] in central Brazil.[176]
In Brazil, [[Forest cover]] is around 59% of the total land area, equivalent to 496,619,600 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 588,898,000 hectares (ha) in 1990.
Of the naturally regenerating forest, 44% was reported to be [[Primary forest]] (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 30% of the forest area was found within protected areas.
For 2015, 56% of the forest area was reported to be under [[State ownership]] and 44% [[Private property]].[177][178]
Many regions have starkly different [[Microclimate]].[179][180] An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil.
There is no real [[Dry season]], but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.[176] Temperatures average 25 °C (77 °F),[180] with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.[179] Over central Brazil, rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.[179] This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.[176] In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.[181] South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.[176] The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18 °C (64.4 °F);[180] winter frosts and [[Snow in Brazil]] are not rare in the highest areas.[176][179]
The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimeters (31.5 in) of rain,[181] most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year[182] and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.[179] Brazil's 1877–78 [[Grande Seca]] (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,[183] caused approximately half a million deaths.[184] A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.[185] In 2024, for the first time, "a drought has covered all the way from the North to the country's Southeast".
[[Climate change in Brazil]] is causing higher temperatures and longer-lasting heatwaves, changing precipitation patterns, more intense wildfires and heightened fire risk.[190] Brazil's hydropower, agriculture and urban water supplies will be affected.[191] Brazil's rainforests, and the Amazon, are particularly at risk to climate change.
At worst, large areas of the Amazon River basin could turn into savannah, with severe consequences for global climate and local livelihoods.[192] [[Extreme weather]] events like droughts and flash floods are causing annual losses of around R$13 billion (US$2.6 billion), equivalent to 0.1% of the country's 2022 GDP.
Brazil's [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita]], and Brazil is among the top 10 [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions]].
[[Greenhouse gas emissions]] by Brazil are over 4% of the annual world total.[193] In 2024 Brazil revised its [[Nationally determined contribution]] (NDC), setting a goal to cut [[Greenhouse gas emissions]] by 59% to 67% compared to 2005 levels by 2035.[194][195] It has an indicative target of reaching [[Carbon neutrality]] by 2060 if the country receives 10 billion dollars per year.[196] Brazil hosted the [[2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference]],[197] in which it launched the [[Climate Coalition (COP30 proposal)]] immediately joined by 11 countries including Brazil, [[China]], [[European Union]], [[United Kingdom]].[198] According to some calculations, a global carbon market can speed up emission reduction seven-fold.[199]
The southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900 ft).[200] These ranges include the [[Mantiqueira Mountains]] and [[Espinhaço Mountains]] mountains and the [[Serra do Mar]].[200] In the north, the [[Guiana Shield]] form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the [[Orinoco]] River system, in Venezuela, to the north.
The highest point in Brazil is the [[Pico da Neblina]] at 2,994 meters (9,823 ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]
Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic.[201] Major rivers include the [[Amazon River]] (the world's largest in terms of water volume), the [[Paraná River]] and its major tributary the [[Iguazu River]] (which includes the [[Iguazu Falls]]), the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)]], [[São Francisco River]], [[Xingu River]], [[Madeira River]] and [[Tapajós]] rivers.[201]
The [[Wildlife of Brazil]] comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country.
Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world,[202] Brazil is considered to have the greatest [[Biodiversity]] of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued.[203] Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000) and mammals (over 689).[204] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).[204] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large.[205] Brazil is second only to [[Indonesia]] as the country with the most [[Endemic]] species.[206]
Brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world,[207] with the [[Atlantic Forest]] and the [[Cerrado]] sustaining the greatest biodiversity.[208] In the south, the [[Araucaria moist forests]] grow under temperate conditions.[208] The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats.
Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.[208] Larger mammals include carnivores [[Cougar]], [[Jaguar]], [[Ocelot]], rare [[Bush dog]], and [[Fox]], and herbivores [[Peccary]], [[Tapir]], [[Anteater]], [[Sloth]], [[Opossum]] and [[Armadillo]].
[[Deer]] are plentiful in the south, and many species of [[New World monkey]] are found in the northern rainforests.[208][209]
More than one-fifth of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed, and more than 70 mammals are endangered.[204] The threat of extinction comes from several sources, including [[Deforestation in Brazil]] and [[Poaching]].
Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through [[Habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation]].[213] Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi) of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging.[214]
The form of government is a [[Democracy]] [[Federation]] [[Republic]], with a [[Presidential system]].[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term.
The current president is [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].[218] The president appoints the [[Minister of State]], who form the [[Cabinet of Brazil]] and assist in government.[15]
The [[National Congress of Brazil]] is the federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]] and the [[Senate of Brazil]].
The Senate represents the [[States of Brazil]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)]].
Each state and the Federal District has a representation of three senators, who are elected by popular ballot for a term of eight years.[219][220] The Chamber of Deputies represents the people of each state, and its members are elected for a four-year term by a system of [[Proportional representation]].[221] Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.
According to [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance]]’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Brazil performs in the mid to high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in inclusive suffrage, freedom of religion, and civic engagement.[222] In 2021, the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[Democracy Index]] categorized Brazil as a "[[Flawed democracy]]", ranking 46th in the report,[223] and [[Freedom House]] classified it as a [[Free World]] at [[Freedom in the World]] report.[224] According to the [[V-Dem Democracy Indices#Regimes of the World]] classification Brazil was an [[Representative democracy]] in year 2024.[225]
The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political [[Pluralism (political theory)]].[15]
The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized [[Separation of powers]], while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres.
For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a [[Multi-party system]], with [[Proportional representation]].
Voting is [[Compulsory voting]] for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has around [[List of political parties in Brazil]].
Brazilian law is based on the [[Civil law (legal system)]] legal system[230] and [[Civil law (legal system)]] concepts prevail over common law practice.
The legal system is based on the [[Constitution of Brazil]], promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil.
All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[231] As of July 2022[update], there have been 124 amendments.[232] The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court]].
States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[233] Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (leis orgânicas), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[234] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[15] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[15] There are also specialized military, labor and [[Brazilian Election Justice]].[15]
Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state]], one [[Federal district]], and the 5,571 [[Municipality]].[15] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government.
They also have independent [[Court of Justice (Brazil)]] for common justice.
Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called [[Comarca]].[15]
Brazil's constitution also provides for the creation of [[Federal territories of Brazil]], which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government.
However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amapá and Roraima (which gained statehood) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of [[Pernambuco]].[235][236]
Brazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes [[Non-interventionism]], [[Self-determination]], [[Internationalism (politics)]] and the [[Peacebuilding]] as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.[237] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and [[Treaty]], as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.[238]
Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's position as a [[Regional power]] in Latin America, a leader among [[Developing countries]], and an emerging [[World power]].[239] Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of [[Multilateralism]], peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.[240] Brazil is a founding member state of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of [[Lusophone]] nations.
An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.[241] Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.[241] Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year.[241] In addition, Brazil already managed a [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti]] ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the [[World Food Programme]] ($300 million).[241] The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India.[241] The Brazilian [[South-South]] aid has been described as a "global model in waiting".[242]
The armed forces of Brazil are the [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]] in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[243] It consists of the [[Brazilian Army]] (including the [[Brazilian Army Aviation]]), the [[Brazilian Navy]] (including the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] and [[Brazilian Naval Aviation]]) and the [[Brazilian Air Force]].
Brazil's [[Conscription in Brazil]] gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million [[Military Reserve]] annually.[244] The Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.[245]
Numbering close to 236,000 active personnel,[246] the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in South America, including armored transports and [[Battle tank]].[247] The states' [[Military Police (Brazil)]] and the [[Military Firefighters Corps]] are designated as auxiliary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor.[15]
Brazil's navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two [[Minas Geraes-class battleship]] [[Dreadnought]], sparking a [[South American dreadnought race]].[248] Today, it is a [[Green-water navy]] force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, [[GRUMEC]], unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast.[249] As of 2022[update], it is the only navy in Latin America that operates a [[Helicopter carrier]], [[Brazilian aircraft carrier Atlântico]] and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction.[250]
In Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: [[Federal Police Department]], [[Federal Highway Police (Brazil)]], [[Federal Railroad Police]], Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No. 104, of 2019), [[Military Police (Brazil)]] and [[Civil Police (Brazil)]].
All police forces are overseen by the executive branch of the federal or state government.[15] The [[National Public Security Force]] also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.[251]
In 2022, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) estimated an intentional homicide rate of 21.1 per 100,000 inhabitants.[252] The number considered acceptable by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[253] In 2024, Brazil recorded 38,772 homicides, down from 40,768 in 2023,[254] and from a record 63,880 in 2017.[255] Homicide rates vary regionally.
While in [[São Paulo (state)]] the homicide rate registered in 2023 was 6.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, in [[Amapá]] it was 57.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.[256] The national homicide rate for 2024 was 17.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest in over a decade.[254]
[[Human rights in Brazil]] include the [[Right to life]] and [[Freedom of speech]]; and condemnation of slavery and torture.
The nation ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].[259] The 2017 [[Freedom in the World]] report by [[Freedom House]] gives Brazil a score of "2" for both political rights and civil liberties; "1" represents the most free, and "7", the least.[260] According to [[UNESCO]], "Brazil promotes a vast array of actions for the advancement and defense of human rights, even though it faces enormous social and economic inequalities".[261] Same-sex couples in Brazil have held nationwide [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil]] since May 2013.[262]
Brazil is a [[Developing country]] with an [[List of countries by GNI (nominal) per capita#Upper-middle income group]] [[Mixed economy]] [[Market economy]] that is rich in natural resources.[266] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]] in the world by nominal GDP, and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)]] by [[Purchasing power parity]].[267] After rapid growth in preceding decades, Brazil [[2014–2016 Brazilian economic recession]] amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests; in 2024, the economy began showing consistent significant growth.[268] Brazil has a [[Labor force]] of roughly 100 million, which is the world's [[List of countries by labour force]].[269] Its [[Foreign exchange reserves]] are the [[List of countries by foreign exchange reserves]] in the world.[270] The [[B3 (stock exchange)]] in São Paulo is the [[List of stock exchanges]].
Roughly one-fifth of Brazilians live in poverty: about 3.8% of the total population lives at $3.00 a day,[271] while about 23% live at $8.30 a day.[272] Brazil's economy suffers from [[Corruption in Brazil]] and [[Income inequality in Brazil]].[273] The [[Brazilian real]] is the national currency.
Brazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry and a wide range of services.[274] The large service sector accounts for about 72.7% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (20.7%), while the [[Agriculture in Brazil]] is by far the smallest, making up 6.6% of total GDP.[275]
Brazil is one of the [[List of largest producing countries of agricultural commodities]],[276] and also has a large [[Cooperative]] sector that provides 50% of the food in the country.[277] It has been the world's largest [[Coffee production in Brazil]] for the last 150 years[27] and is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee and oranges; is one of the top five producers of maize, cotton, lemon, tobacco, pineapple, banana, beans, coconut, watermelon and papaya; and is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, mango, rice, tomato, sorghum, tangerine, avocado, persimmon, and guava, among others.
In the [[Mining in Brazil]], Brazil is among the largest producers of iron ore, copper, gold,[279] bauxite, manganese, tin, [[Niobium]],[280] and nickel.
In terms of precious stones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of [[Amethyst]], [[Topaz]], [[Agate]] and one of the main producers of [[Tourmaline]], [[Emerald]], [[Aquamarine (gemstone)]], [[Garnet]] and [[Opal]].[281][282] The country is a major exporter of soy, iron ore, pulp (cellulose), maize, beef, chicken meat, soybean meal, sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol and semi-finished iron, among other products.[283][284]
Brazil is the world's [[List of countries by exports]] and [[List of countries by imports]] as of 2021[update].[285][286] China is its largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of the total trade.
Other large trading partners include the United States, Argentina, the Netherlands and Canada.[287] Its [[Automotive industry in Brazil]] is the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production]] in the world.[288] In the [[Food industry]], Brazil was the second-largest exporter of processed foods in the world in 2019.[289] The country was the second-largest producer of [[Pulp (paper)]] in the world and the eighth-largest producer of paper in 2016.[290] In the [[Footwear industry]], Brazil was the fourth-largest producer in 2019.[291] It was also the ninth-largest producer of steel in the world.[292][293][294] In 2018, the [[Chemical industry]] of Brazil was the eighth-largest in the world.[295][296][297] Although it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, Brazil's textile industry is very little integrated into world trade.[298]
The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico.[302] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the [[Late-2000s recession]].[303] Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011.[304][305] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).[306]
Natural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of [[Ecotourism]] with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism.
Among the most popular destinations are the Amazon Rainforest, beaches and dunes in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil]], the [[Pantanal]] in the [[Center-West Region, Brazil]], beaches at [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)]], cultural tourism in [[Minas Gerais]] and business trips to [[São Paulo]].[307]
In terms of the 2024 [[Travel and Tourism Development Index]] (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 26th place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.[308] [[Domestic tourism]] is a key market segment for the tourism industry in Brazil.
In 2005, 51 million Brazilian nationals made ten times more trips than foreign tourists and spent five times more money than their international counterparts.[309] The main destination states in 2023 were [[São Paulo (state)]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]], and [[Rio Grande do Sul]].[310][311] The main source of tourists for the entire country is São Paulo state.[312] In terms of tourism revenues, the top earners by state were [[São Paulo (state)]] and [[Bahia]].[313] For 2005, the three main trip purposes were visiting friends and family (53.1%), sun and beach (40.8%), and cultural tourism (12.5%).[314]
Technological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.[315] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the [[Fundação Oswaldo Cruz]], the [[Instituto Butantan]], the Air Force's [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology]], the [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária]] and the [[National Institute for Space Research]].[316][317]
The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of satellites.[318] The country [[Submarine Development Program]] and aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the Southern Hemisphere to integrate a team building the well-known [[International Space Station]] (ISS).[319]
Uranium is enriched at the [[Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory]], mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% of its electricity from [[Hydroelectricity]])[320] and the country's [[Brazilian submarine Álvaro Alberto]] is expected to be launched in 2029.[321]
Brazil is one of the three countries in Latin America[322] with an operational [[Synchrotron]] Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences, and Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a semiconductor company with its own [[Semiconductor fabrication plant]], the [[CEITEC]].[323] According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009–2010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the world's 61st largest developer of information technology.[324] Brazil was ranked 52st in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2025, up from 66th in 2019.[325][326][327]
Among the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]], [[Landell de Moura]] and Francisco João de Azevedo, besides [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]],[328] [[Evaristo Conrado Engelberg]],[329] [[Manuel Dias de Abreu]],[330] [[Andreas Pavel]][331] and Nélio José Nicolai.[332] Brazilian science is represented by the likes of [[César Lattes]] (Brazilian physicist Pathfinder of [[Pion]]),[333] [[Mário Schenberg]] (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil),[334] [[José Leite Lopes]] (the only Brazilian physicist holder of the UNESCO Science Prize),[335] [[Artur Avila]] (the first Latin American winner of the [[Fields Medal]])[336] and [[Fritz Müller]] (pioneer in factual support of the theory of evolution by [[Charles Darwin]]).[337]
Brazil is the world's [[List of countries by energy consumption and production]] energy consumer.[338] Much of its energy comes from [[Renewable energy]], particularly [[Hydroelectricity]] and [[Ethanol]]; the [[Itaipu Dam]] is the world's largest [[Hydroelectricity]] by energy generation,[339] and the country has other large plants such as [[Belo Monte Dam]] and [[Tucuruí Dam]].
At the end of 2021 Brazil was the 2nd country in the world in terms of installed [[Hydroelectric power]] (109.4 GW) and [[Biomass]] (15.8 GW), the 7th country in the world in terms of installed [[Wind power]] (21.1 GW) and the 14th country in the world in terms of installed [[Solar power]] (13.0 GW)—on track to also become one of the top 10 in the world in solar energy.[341] At the end of 2024, Brazil was the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (107.8 TWh), behind only China, the United States and Germany, and the 5th largest producer of solar energy in the world (74.7 TWh).[342]
The [[Brazilian Highway System]] totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019.[349] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018.[350]
Brazil's [[Rail transport in Brazil]] has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to highway construction.
The country's total railway track length was 30,576 km (18,999 mi) in 2015,[351] as compared with 31,848 km (19,789 mi) in 1970, making it the [[List of countries by rail transport network size]] in the world.
Most of the railway system belonged to the [[RFFSA]] (RFFSA), which was privatized in 2007.[352] The [[São Paulo Metro]] began operating on 14 September 1974 as the first underground transit system in Brazil.[353]
There are about 2,500 airports in Brazil, including landing fields: the second-largest number in the world, after the United States.[354] [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport]], near São Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 43 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.[355][356]
The [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus]] can be reached only by means of the Solimões–Amazonas waterway (3,250 kilometers or 2,020 miles in length, with a minimum depth of six meters or 20 feet).
Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free ports at [[Santos, São Paulo]].
Of the 36 deep-water ports, [[Port of Santos]], [[Port of Itajaí]], [[Port of Rio Grande]], [[Port of Paranaguá]], [[Port of Rio de Janeiro]], Sepetiba, [[Port of Tubarão]], [[Suape Port]], [[Port of Manaus]] and [[Port of São Francisco do Sul]] are the most important.[358] Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced; container ships take 36.3 hours on average.[359]
The first census in Brazil was carried out [[1872 Brazilian census]] and recorded a population of 9,930,478.[365] From 1880 to 1930, four million Europeans arrived.[366] Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the [[Mortality rate]], even though the [[Birth rate]] underwent a slight decline.
In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years[367] and to 72.6 years in 2007.[368] It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050[369] thus completing the [[Demographic transition]].[370] In 2022, the illiteracy rate was roughly 7%,[371] a significant decline from 11.48% in 2008.[372] By comparison, in 1940, more than half the population (54%) was illiterate.[371]
According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[373]
The largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Belo Horizonte]]—all in the Southeastern Region—with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively.[374][375][376] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for [[Vitória, Brazil]], the capital of [[Espírito Santo]], and [[Florianópolis]], the capital of Santa Catarina.[377]
According to the [[2022 Brazilian census]], 45.3% of the population (92.1 million) described themselves as [[Pardo Brazilians]] (meaning [[Brown (racial classification)]] or multiracial), 43.5% (88.2 million) as [[White Brazilians]], 10.2% (20.7 million) as [[Afro-Brazilians]], 0.6% (1.2 million) as [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]] and 0.4% (850,000) as [[Asian Brazilians]] (officially called [[Mongoloid]] or amarela).[380]
From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to [[Immigration to Brazil]].
About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of [[Portuguese Brazilian]], [[Italian Brazilian]], [[Brazilians of Spanish descent]], [[German Brazilian]], [[English Brazilian]], [[Ukrainian Brazilian]], [[Polish Brazilian]], [[Jewish Brazilian]], [[Afro-Brazilian]], [[Armenians]], [[Russians in Brazil]], [[Chinese Brazilian]], [[Japanese Brazilian]], [[Korean Brazilian]] and [[Arab Brazilian]] origin.[393][394][395] Brazil has the second-largest Jewish community in Latin America after Argentina making up 0.06% of its population.[396] Outside of the [[Arab world]], Brazil also has the largest [[Arab diaspora]] of Arab ancestry in the world, with 15–20 million people.[397][398] According to Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil is home to a Lebanese diaspora of 7-10 million, surpassing the population of Lebanese individuals residing in Lebanon.[399]
Brazilian society is more [[Social issues in Brazil]], although a high [[Income inequality in Brazil]] is found [[Social apartheid in Brazil]], so racism and [[Class discrimination]] often overlap.
The brown population (officially called pardo in Portuguese)[400][401] is a broad category that includes [[Caboclo]] (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), [[Mulatto]] (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and [[Zambo]] (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives).[400][401][402][403][404] Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba[404][405] and also in northern Maranhão,[406][407] southern Minas Gerais[408] and eastern Rio de Janeiro.[404][408]
People of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.[409] In 2007, the [[Fundação Nacional do Índio]] estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005.
Brazil is believed to have the largest number of [[Uncontacted peoples]] in the world.[410]
The official language of Brazil is [[Portuguese language]] (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes.
[[Brazilian Portuguese]] has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese[412] (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and [[Portuguese Brazilian]], coming from [[Northern Portugal]], and in minor degree Portuguese [[Macaronesia]]), with a few influences from the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] and [[Languages of Africa]], especially [[West Africa]] and [[Bantu languages]] restricted to the vocabulary only.[413] As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary [[European Portuguese]]).
These differences are comparable to those between [[American English]] and [[British English]].[413]
The 2002 [[Recognition of sign languages]][414] requires government authorities and public agencies to accept and provide information in Língua Brasileira dos Sinais or "LIBRAS", the [[Brazilian Sign Language]], while a 2005 presidential edict[415] extends this to require teaching of the language as a part of the education and [[Speech and language pathology]] curricula.
Schools and health services must provide access ("[[Inclusion (education)]]") to deaf people.[416]
One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.[413] In the municipality of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]], [[Nheengatu language]] (a currently endangered [[Creole language]] that, together with its southern relative [[Língua geral paulista]], once was a major [[Lingua franca]] in Brazil),[417] [[Baniwa of Içana]] and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.[418]
There are significant communities of German (mostly the [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the [[Talian dialect]], a [[Venetian language]] dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language.[419][420] Talian is officially a historic heritage of [[Rio Grande do Sul]],[421] and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.[422] Italian is also recognized as "ethnic language" in [[Santa Teresa, Espírito Santo]] and [[Vila Velha]], in the state of [[Espírito Santo]].[423]
Brazil has the [[Catholic Church by country]].[424][425][426] According to the 2022 demographic census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 56.75% of the population followed Catholicism; 26.85% [[Protestantism in Brazil]]; 1.84% Kardecist spiritism; 5.06% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 9.28% had no religion.[3]
Religious pluralism increased during the 20th century,[429] and the Protestant community had grown to include over 22% of the population by 2010—partly due to a mixture of American missionary and government influence.[430][431] The most common Protestant denominations are [[Evangelicalism]] [[Pentecostalism]] ones.
Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the [[Baptists]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Lutheranism]] and the [[Calvinism]].[432] In recent decades, Protestantism, particularly in forms of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics had dropped significantly during the 2010s.[433] As they have spread throughout Brazil, many have even been deeply involved in Brazilian and international politics,[434][435] and Evangelical Protestant influence has been implicated in the [[2022 Brazilian coup plot]].[436] Since 2022, Evangelicals and Catholics have begun reconsidering religion as a political factor.[437]
The cities of [[Boa Vista, Roraima]], [[Salvador, Bahia]], and [[Porto Velho]] have the greatest proportion of [[Irreligion]] residents in Brazil.
[[Teresina]], [[Fortaleza]], and [[Florianópolis]] were the most Roman Catholic in the country.[438] [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]], not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while [[Greater Porto Alegre]] and Greater [[Fortaleza]] are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.[438]
In October 2009, the Brazilian Senate approved and enacted by the President of Brazil in February 2010, an agreement with the [[Holy See]], in which the Legal Statute of the Catholic Church in Brazil is recognized.[439][440]
According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]], the literacy rate was 93.4% in 2019, meaning that 11.3 million (6.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country, with some states such as [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)]] reaching around 97% of literacy rate;[442] functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population.[443] Illiteracy is higher in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil]], where 13.87% of the population is illiterate, while the [[South Region, Brazil]], has 3.3% of its population illiterate.[444][442]
However, efforts to change this are making impacts.[445] The [[University of São Paulo]] is often considered [[College and university rankings]].[446][447] Of the top 20 Latin American universities, eight are Brazilian; most are [[Public university]].
The Brazilian [[Public health]] system, the [[Sistema Único de Saúde]] (Sistema Único de Saúde – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government,[449] being the largest system of this type in the world.[450] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role.[451] Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free.
Despite all the progress made since the creation of the [[Universal health care]] system in 1988, there are still several public health issues in Brazil.
In 2023, [[List of countries by infant mortality rate]] (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (197.3 deaths per 100,000 births) were still high.[454]
The number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as [[Cardiovascular diseases]] (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and [[Cancer]] (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population.
Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.[454] The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 2000.[455]
The core culture of Brazil is derived from [[Culture of Portugal]], due to its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[457] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles.
Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well as Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[459] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and [[Brazilian cuisine]]; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, [[Music of Brazil]], dance and religion.[460]
[[Brazilian art]] has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from [[Baroque in Brazil]] (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[461][462] to [[Brazilian academic art]], [[Modern art]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract art]].
[[Cinema of Brazil]] dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.[463]
[[Portuguese colonial architecture]] was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.[464] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.[465] In the 19th century, during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted [[Neoclassical architecture]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]].
Then, in the 20th century, especially in Brasília, Brazil experimented with [[Modernist architecture]].
This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage.[466] In the 1950s modernist architecture was introduced when [[Brasília]] was built as a new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior.
The architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.[467]
Brazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century,[468] influenced by [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism (arts)]], [[Modernism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Abstract art]] making it a major art style called [[Brazilian academic art]].[469][470]
The [[Missão Artística Francesa]] arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Académie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]].[470]
Upon the creation of the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Brazil)]], new artistic movements spread across the country during the 19th century and later the event called Modern Art Week broke with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts.[471]
Among the best-known Brazilian painters are [[Ricardo do Pilar]] and [[Manoel da Costa Ataíde]] (baroque and rococo), [[Victor Meirelles]], [[Pedro Américo]] and [[Almeida Júnior]] (romanticism and realism), [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Ismael Nery]], [[Lasar Segall]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti]], [[Vicente do Rego Monteiro]], and [[Tarsila do Amaral]] (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), [[Aldo Bonadei]], [[José Pancetti]] and [[Candido Portinari]] (modernism).[472]
The first was [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]], author of sacred pieces with an influence of Viennese classicism.[474] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments.[473]
Popular music since the late eighteenth century, [[Samba]] was considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.[475] [[Samba reggae]], [[Axé]], [[Maracatu]], [[Frevo]] and [[Afoxê]] are four music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual [[Brazilian Carnival]].[476] [[Capoeira]] is usually played with its own music referred to as [[Capoeira music]], which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.[477] [[Forró]] is a type of folk music prominent during the [[Festa Junina]] in [[Northeast Region, Brazil]].[478] Jack A.
Draper III, a professor of Portuguese at the [[University of Missouri]],[479] argues that Forró was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle.[480]
[[Choro]] is a popular musical instrumental style.
The style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by subtle [[Modulation (music)]] and full of [[Syncopation]] and [[Counterpoint]].[481] [[Lambada]] and [[Carimbó]] achieved success in Latin music, originating from Pará.[482] [[Bossa nova]] is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.[483] The phrase "bossa nova" means literally 'new trend'.[484] A lyrical fusion of samba and [[Jazz]], bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.[485]
[[Brazilian literature]] dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]], filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.[486]
Brazil produced significant works in [[Romanticism]]—novelists such as [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] and [[José de Alencar]] wrote novels about love and pain.
Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the [[Indianism (arts)]] novels [[The Guarani]], [[Iracema]] and [[Ubirajara (novel)]].[487] [[Machado de Assis]], one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.[488][489][490]
[[Brazilian literature#Modernism]], evidenced by the [[Modern Art Week]] in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature,[491] while [[Brazilian literature#Post-Modernism]] brought a generation of distinct poets such as [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]], [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], [[Vinicius de Moraes]], [[Cora Coralina]], [[Graciliano Ramos]], [[Cecília Meireles]], and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects such as [[Jorge Amado]], [[João Guimarães Rosa]], [[Clarice Lispector]] and [[Manuel Bandeira]].[492][493][494]
Brazil's most significant literary award is the [[Camões Prize]], which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world.
As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.[495] Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]], a non-profit cultural organization aimed at perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.[496]
The theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of [[Jesuits]] expansion, when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, dramatists on the scene of European derivation were for court or private performances.[497] During the 19th century, the playwrights [[Gonçalves Dias]] and [[Martins Pena]] were known for their performance.[498] There were also numerous operas and orchestras.
The Brazilian conductor [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]] became internationally known with operas such as [[Il Guarany]].
At the end of the 19th century, orchestrated dramaturgias were accompanied with songs of famous artists such as the conductress [[Chiquinha Gonzaga]].[499]
In 1940, Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors [[Adolfo Celi]], Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, renewed the Brazilian theater.
The most prominent authors at this stage were Jorge Andrade and [[Ariano Suassuna]].[498]
The Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the [[Belle Époque]].
While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city.[500] The films [[Limite]] (1931) and [[Ganga Bruta]] (1933), the latter being produced by [[Adhemar Gonzaga]] through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.[501] The 1941 unfinished film [[It's All True (film)]] was divided into four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by [[Orson Welles]]; it was originally produced as part of the United States' [[Good Neighbor Policy]] during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo.
During the 1960s, the [[Cinema Novo]] movement rose to prominence with directors such as [[Glauber Rocha]], [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]], [[Paulo César Saraceni]] and [[Arnaldo Jabor]].
Glauber Rocha's films [[Black God, White Devil]] (1964) and [[Entranced Earth]] (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.[502] Rocha won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)]] at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival]] for [[Antonio das Mortes]] and the [[1977 Cannes Film Festival]] [[Short Film Palme d'Or]] for Di.
During the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as [[O Quatrilho]] ([[Fábio Barreto]], 1995), [[O Que É Isso, Companheiro?]] ([[Bruno Barreto]], 1997) and [[Central Station (film)]] ([[Walter Salles]], 1998), all of which were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], the latter receiving a [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] nomination for [[Fernanda Montenegro]].
The 2002 crime film [[City of God (2002 film)]], directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]], was critically acclaimed, scoring 90% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],[503] being placed in [[Roger Ebert]]'s Best Films of the Decade list[504] and receiving four [[Academy Awards]] nominations in 2004, including [[Academy Award for Best Director]].
Notable film festivals in Brazil include the [[São Paulo International Film Festival]] and [[Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival]] and the [[Festival de Gramado]].
The film [[I'm Still Here (2024 film)]], directed by Walter Salles, was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (Torres) and [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[97th Academy Awards]],[505][506][507] and won [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film]], becoming the first-ever Brazilian produced film to win an Academy Award.[508] The film [[The Secret Agent (2025 film)]] had its world premiere at the main competition of the [[2025 Cannes Film Festival]] on 18 May 2025, where it won the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor]] prize for [[Wagner Moura]], the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director]] prize for Mendonça and the [[International Federation of Film Critics]].
The Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent John.[511] The Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808.[512] The largest newspapers nowadays are [[Folha de S.Paulo]], [[O Globo]], and [[O Estado de S.
Radio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President [[Epitácio Pessoa]], and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of the "Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro".[514] Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of [[TV Tupi]] by [[Assis Chateaubriand]].[515] Since then, television has grown in the country, creating large commercial broadcast networks such as [[Rede Globo]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão]], [[RecordTV]], [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[RedeTV!]].
By the mid-1960s, Brazilian universities had installed [[Mainframe computer]] from [[IBM]] and [[Burroughs Large Systems]].
In May 2010, the Brazilian government launched [[TV Brasil Internacional]], an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.[518] Commercial television channels broadcast internationally include [[Globo Internacional]], [[RecordTV Internacional]] and [[Band Internacional]].
This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.[519] Some of the most well known Brazilian foods are the [[Feijoada (Brazilian dish)]], considered the country's national dish;[520] and [[Churrasco]], a kind of barbecue which is often served in [[Rodízio]] style.
Other regional foods include beijú, [[Feijão tropeiro]], [[Vatapá]], [[Moqueca]], [[Polenta]] (from Italian cuisine) and [[Acarajé]] (from African cuisine).[521] The national beverage is [[Coffee]]; [[Cachaça]] is Brazil's native liquor.
Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, [[Caipirinha]].[522]
A typical meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg.[523] Often, it is mixed with cassava flour ([[Farofa]]).
Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.[524] Popular snacks are [[Pastel (food)]] (a fried pastry); [[Coxinha]] (a variation of chicken croquete); [[Pão de queijo]] (cheese bread and cassava flour / [[Tapioca]]); [[Pamonha]] (corn and milk paste); [[Sfiha]] (a variation of Lebanese pastry); [[Kibbeh]] (from Arabic cuisine); and empada (pastry), little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.
Brazil has a variety of desserts such as [[Brigadeiro]] (chocolate fudge balls), [[Bolo de rolo]] (roll cake with [[Goiabada]]), [[Cocada]] (a coconut sweet), [[Beijinho]] (coconut truffles and clove) and [[Romeu e Julieta]] (cheese with goiabada).
Peanuts are used to make [[Paçoca]], [[Rapadura]] and [[Pé de moleque]].
Local common fruits such as [[Açaí]], [[Cupuaçu]], [[Mango]], [[Papaya]], [[Cocoa bean]], [[Cashew]], [[Guava]], [[Orange (fruit)]], [[Lime (fruit)]], [[Passionfruit]], [[Pineapple]], and [[Spondias]] are turned into juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.[525]
The most popular sport in Brazil is [[Association football]].[528] The [[Brazil national football team]] is ranked among the best in the world according to the [[FIFA World Rankings]], and has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] tournament a record five times.[529][530]
[[Volleyball]], [[Basketball]], [[Auto racing]] and [[Martial arts]] also has large audiences.
The [[Brazil men's national volleyball team]] currently holds the titles of the [[FIVB Volleyball World League]], [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Champions Cup]], [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup]].
In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the [[Formula One]] world championship eight times.[531][532][533] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as [[Sailing (sport)]], [[Swimming (sport)]], [[Tennis]], [[Surfing]], [[Skateboarding]], [[MMA]], [[Gymnastics]], [[Boxing]], [[Judo]], [[Track and field]] and [[Table tennis]].
Some sport variations have their origins in Brazil: [[Beach soccer]],[534] [[Futsal]] (indoor football)[535] and [[Footvolley]] emerged in Brazil as variations of football.
In martial arts, Brazilians developed [[Capoeira]],[536] [[Vale tudo]][537] and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].[538]
Brazil has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, such as the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]],[539] and recently has hosted the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[2019 Copa América]] and [[2021 Copa América]].[540] The São Paulo circuit, [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace]], hosts the annual [[Brazilian Grand Prix]].[541] São Paulo organized the [[1963 Pan American Games]] in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in 2007.[542] On 2 October 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], making it the first South American city to host the games[543] and second in Latin America, after [[Mexico City]].
