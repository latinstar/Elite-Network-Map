Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., better known by and [[Trade name]] the [[Portmanteau]] Petrobras (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˌpɛtɾoˈbɾas, pet-]), is a [[Brazil]] [[State-owned enterprise]] [[Multinational corporation]] in the [[Petroleum industry]] headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro]].
The company was ranked #71 in the 2023 [[Fortune Global 500]] list.[9] In the 2023 [[Forbes Global 2000]], Petrobras was ranked as the 58th-largest public company in the world.[10]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the [[Second presidency of Getúlio Vargas]] of Brazilian president [[Getúlio Vargas]] with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso").
It was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[11] In 1953, Brazil produced only 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[12] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[13] and in 1963, its [[Cenpes]] research center opened in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[14] In 1968, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on [[Petrochemical]] and the conversion of [[Naphtha]] into [[Ethene]].[15]
Petrobras had begun processing [[Oil shale]] in 1953, developing the [[Petrosix]] technology for extracting oil from oil shale.
It began using an industrial-size [[Retort]] to process shale in the 1990s.[16] In 2006, Petrobras said that their industrial retort could process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[17]
In 1994, Petrobras put the [[Petrobras 36]], the world's largest [[Oil platform]], into service.
It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[18] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competition in Brazil's oilfields, and also created the [[National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Brazil)]], Agência Nacional do Petróleo (ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[19] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, ending the company's monopoly.[20]
This acquisition included assets in [[Argentina]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Ecuador]], 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, and production of 181 thousand [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[22]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a [[Joint venture]] with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai KK to sell Brazilian [[Ethanol]] to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[23] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the [[Albacora-Leste oil field]] at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficient in oil production.[12] During the administration of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] in the 2010s, Petrobras spent an estimated $40 billion subsidizing motor fuels, causing it to become the world's most indebted oil company.[24] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[25]
In 2022, under the administration of [[Caio Paes de Andrade]], Petrobras achieved its highest net profit in history, totaling R$188.3 billion, distributing R$215.7 billion in dividends, making it the second largest dividend payer in the world.[26]
In summer 2023, Petrobras entered into a 5-year agreement with [[Weatherford International]] for providing intervention services [[Offshore construction]] [[Brazil]].
As part of the cooperation, the US company will also provide [[Digital transformation]] of production using the Centro well construction optimization platform.[27]
Also in 2023, Petrobras announced the resumption of construction of a new production line at the [[Abreu e Lima]] [[Refinery]] in [[Ipojuca]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Brazil]].
The initial investment in the refinery is estimated at $18.5 billion, and the refinery will refine [[Heavy crude oil]] from the Pre-Salt region.[28]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[2] when the company had 8,112.8 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in [[Brazil]].[2] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore [[Campos Basin]].[2] The largest growth prospect for the company is the [[Tupi oil field]] in the [[Santos Basin]].[2]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was [[Petroleum]] and 11% was [[Natural gas]].[2]
Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[2] The majority of these reserves are in [[South America]]; the company has assets in [[Bolivia]] and [[Colombia]].[2]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the [[Gulf of Mexico]],[2] in a joint-venture with Murphy Oil.
Link]] published [[Link's memorandum]], which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[29] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the [[Recôncavo Baiano]] and [[Carmópolis]] oil fields.[19]
The company's growth was halted by the [[1973 oil crisis]].
The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual [[GDP]] growth exceeded 10%, ended.
Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[30] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the [[Campos Basin]].
This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[31] In 1975, the [[Brazilian Government]] temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed exploration contracts with foreign companies for oilfields in Brazil.[32]
The company was affected by the [[1979 energy crisis]], although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 2003, on its 50th anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[33] On 1 May 2006, after the [[Bolivian gas conflict]], Bolivia's president [[Evo Morales]] announced the nationalization of all [[Geology of Bolivia]] and ordered the occupation of all fields by the [[Bolivian Army]].[34] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[35] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[36]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the [[Tupi oil field]] (formerly known as the Lula oil field), the [[Jupiter field]], and the [[Sugar Loaf field]], all in the [[Santos Basin]], 300 km off the coast of [[Rio de Janeiro]].
The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Galp Energia]].
The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the [[Campos Basin]] in January 2009,[39] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000–100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of [[Sinopec]] and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to [[PetroChina]].[40] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired [[ExxonMobil]]'s [[Esso]] assets in [[Chile]] for US$400 million.[41]
Biscardi brought his Brazilian corporate practice to [[Greenberg Traurig]] in January 2020.[43]
In 2012, Petrobras surrendered permits to explore offshore in [[New Zealand]].
Petrobras did not provide a reason but the New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] said the decision was "not a reflection on the capacity to undertake deep-sea drilling or the prospect of activity of that area".
In July 2013, a worker [[Strike action]] shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[45] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in [[Colombia]] to [[Perenco]] for US$380 million.[46]
In September 2013 [[Organizações Globo]] reported on national television that the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had been spying on Petrobras.
The information was based on a top secret NSA file provided to [[The Guardian]] journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] by [[Edward Snowden]] as part of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]].
In 2014, the company sold its assets in [[Peru]] to [[PetroChina]] for US$2.6 billion.[49] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent]] (17,520,000 GJ).[50]
In January 2017, the company concluded the sale of 100 percent of Petrobras Chile Distribuición Ltda (PCD) to the [[Southern Cross Group (Australia)]].
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' [[Common stock]] with voting rights, while the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] and [[Sovereign Fund of Brazil]] each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[53] The privately held shares are traded on [[B3 (stock exchange)]], where they are part of the [[Índice Bovespa]] index.[citation needed] It is also listed in the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the form of [[American depositary receipt]] and in the [[Bolsa de Madrid]].
Operation Car Wash ([[Portuguese language]]: Operação Lava Jato) was a criminal investigation by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]]'s [[Curitiba]] branch.
Originally a [[Money laundering]] investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted [[Bribe]] in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices.[60] The aim of the investigation was to ascertain the extent of a money laundering scheme, estimated by the Regional Superintendent of the Federal Police of [[Paraná (state)]] State in 2015 at [[Brazilian real]]6.4–42.8 billion (US$2–13 billion), largely through the [[Embezzlement]] of Petrobras funds.[61][62]: 60
Fernando Soares, also known as "Fernando Baiano," a businessman and lobbyist, was allegedly the connection between major Brazilian construction firms and the government formed by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]](PT) and [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB).[64][65] Between 2014 and February 2016, the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)]] (Portuguese: Ministério Público da União) filed 37 criminal charges against 179 people, mostly politicians and businessmen.[66] Former President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]][67] and then President [[Dilma Rousseff]][68] were also implicated.
On 8 March 2016, [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], CEO of [[Odebrecht]] and grandson of the company's founder, was sentenced to 19 years in prison after being convicted of paying more than $30 million in bribes to Petrobras executives.[69] [[Eduardo Cunha]], president of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)]] from 2015 to 2016, was convicted of taking approximately $40 million in bribes and hiding funds in secret bank accounts and sentenced to 15 years in prison.[70][71]
Protests broke out calling for the resignation or [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] of President [[Dilma Rousseff]].
Police estimates gave about 3.5 million protestors throughout the country.[72] Some of the protests were in areas previously thought of as strongholds of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]], of which Rousseff was the leader.[73]
The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] sued Petrobras and its auditors, [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] as a result of the corruption scandal.[74] In January 2018, Petrobras agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit.[75] Later in September 2018, Petrobras agreed to pay $853.2 million to settle with [[Brazil]] and [[United States]] authorities.[76] Petrobras settled with shareholder [[The Vanguard Group]] in June 2017.[77]
These include efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[79] Most notably, Petrobras has sponsored [[Population studies]] and conservation efforts for [[Humpback whale]] in northeast Brazil.
Petrobras subscribes to the [[United Nations Global Compact]], a voluntary agreement regarding human rights, [[Working condition]], [[Corruption]], and the [[Environment (biophysical)]].[81]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence named Petrobras the world's most [[Sustainable]] oil company.[82]
