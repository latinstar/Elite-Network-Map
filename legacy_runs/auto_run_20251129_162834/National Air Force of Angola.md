The National Air Force of Angola (FANA; [[Portuguese language]]: Força Aérea Nacional de Angola) is the [[Air force]] branch of the [[Angolan Armed Forces]].
With an inventory of more than 300 aircraft, FANA is (on paper) one of the largest and strongest air forces of [[Africa]].
[[Angola]] became independent from [[Portugal]] on 11 November 1975.
However, the foundations for the establishment of the air force were laid before independence when members of the then Flying Club of Angola (Aeroclube de Angola) were assembled at Luanda in October 1975.[2] These people and aircraft left behind by the [[Portuguese Air Force]] formed the basis for the air transport branch of the force.
Its first batch of Soviet MiG fighter aircraft was delivered in mid-December 1975.[2] The FAPA/DAA fought several battles with [[South African Air Force]] aircraft in November 1981, October 1982, and twice in September 1987.[3]
The FANA has bases at [[Luanda]], [[Catumbela Airport]], [[Belas, Luanda]], [[Luena, Moxico Province]], [[Kuito]], [[Lubango]] and [[Yuri Gagarin Airport]].
[[The World Factbook]], produced by the [[CIA]], reported that by 2007 the name of the force had changed to "National Air Force".[4]
On 14 September 2011, an [[Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia]], operated by the Air Force, crashed just after takeoff from [[Nova Lisboa Airport]],[13] killing 11 army officers (including three generals, among them [[Kalias Pedro]]) and six civilians.[14][15] The accident occurred at 11:30 am at the airport, with a military delegation on board the flight at [[Albano Machado Airport]].[16]
