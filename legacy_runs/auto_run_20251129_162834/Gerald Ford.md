Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was the 38th [[President of the United States]] from 1974 to 1977.
A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]], Ford assumed the presidency after [[Resignation of Richard Nixon]] of [[Richard Nixon]], under whom he had served as the 40th [[Vice president of the United States]] from 1973 to 1974 following the resignation of [[Spiro Agnew]].
Prior to that, he served as a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1949 to 1973.
Ford was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and raised in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].
He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he played for [[Michigan Wolverines football]], before eventually attending [[Yale Law School]].
Afterward, he served in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] from 1942 to 1946.
Ford began his political career in 1949 as the U.S. representative from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], serving in this capacity for nearly 25 years, the final nine of them as the [[House minority leader]].
In December 1973, two months after the resignation of Vice President Agnew, Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].
Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the [[Great Depression]], with growing inflation and [[1973–1975 recession]].[1] In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a [[Presidential pardon to Nixon]] for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]].
Foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the president.[2] Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], which marked a move toward [[Détente]] in the [[Cold War]].
With the collapse of [[South Vietnam]] eight months into his presidency, [[U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] essentially ended.
In the [[1976 Republican Party presidential primaries]], he narrowly defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination, but narrowly lost the [[1976 United States presidential election]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)]] candidate, [[Jimmy Carter]].
After experiencing a series of health problems, he [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford]], in 2006.
Surveys of historians and political scientists [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]] Ford as a below-average president,[3][4][5] though retrospective public polls on his time in office were more positive.[6][7]
Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents.
He was the only child of [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner]] and [[Leslie Lynch King Sr.]], a wool trader.
His paternal grandfather was banker and businessman [[Charles Henry King]], and his maternal grandfather was Illinois politician and businessman Levi Addison Gardner.
Ford's parents separated just sixteen days after his birth and his mother took the infant Ford with her to [[Oak Park, Illinois]], where her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law Clarence Haskins James lived at 410 N.
Humphrey Ave.[8] From there, she moved to the home of her parents in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].
Cannon]] wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents was sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a [[Butcher knife]] and threatened to kill his wife, infant son, and Ford's nursemaid.
After living with her parents for two and a half years, on February 1, 1917, Gardner married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]], a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company.
Though never formally adopted, her young son was referred to as Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. from then on; the [[Name change]], including the anglicized spelling "Rudolph", was formalized on December 3, 1935.[12] He was raised in what is now [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan]] with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: [[Thomas Gardner Ford]] (1918–1995), Richard Addison "Dick" Ford (1924–2015), and James Francis "Jim" Ford (1927–2001).[13]
Ford was involved in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and earned that program's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)]] in August 1927.[14] He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. presidency.[14] Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and [[Captain (sports)]] of the [[American football]] team.[15] In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]].
Ford attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he played [[Center (gridiron football)]] and [[Linebacker]] for the school's football team[17] and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] to two undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship]] in [[1932 Michigan Wolverines football team]] and [[1933 Michigan Wolverines football team]].
In his senior year of [[1934 Michigan Wolverines football team]], the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player.
In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football]]—the eventual national champion—to a scoreless tie in the first half.
After the game, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] said, "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them.
During Ford's senior year, a controversy developed when [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football]] said that it would not play a scheduled game with Michigan if a Black player named [[Willis Ward]] took the field.
Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but he eventually agreed to play against [[Georgia Tech]] when Ward personally asked him to play.[19]
In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team in the Shriners' [[East-West Shrine Bowl]] at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935.
As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the [[Chicago Bears]] in the [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] at [[Soldier Field]].[20] In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994.
With the blessing of the Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the [[Michigan Wolverines football#Michigan Football Legends]] program and issued to sophomore linebacker [[Desmond Morgan]] before a home game against [[University of Illinois]] on October 13.[21]
Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices; at one point, he asked to join the players in the huddle.[22] Before state events, Ford often had the Navy band play the University of Michigan fight song, "[[The Victors]]," instead of "[[Hail to the Chief]]."[23]
Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Economics]].
He turned down offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]].
Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at [[Yale University]][24] and applied to its law school.[25]
In 1936, Ford worked as a seasonal [[Park ranger]] at [[Yellowstone National Park]]'s Canyon Station.[26] He then spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]][27] and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to [[Yale Law School]].[24] That year he was also promoted to the position of junior varsity head football coach at Yale.[28] While at Yale, Ford began working as a model.
He initially worked with the [[John Robert Powers]] agency before investing in the [[Harry Conover]] agency, with whom he modelled until 1941.[29]
Douglas Stuart Jr.]], and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s]].
The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].[30] His introduction into politics was in the summer of 1940 when he worked for the Republican presidential campaign of [[Wendell Willkie]].[24]
Ford graduated in the top third of his class in 1941, and was admitted to the [[State Bar of Michigan]] shortly thereafter.
Following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], Ford enlisted in the Navy.[31] He received a commission as [[Ensign (United States)]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] on April 13, 1942.[32] On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].
After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill.
During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]], on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943.[33]
After Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier [[USS Monterey (CVL-26)]], at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey]].
While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet]] in late 1943 and 1944.
In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin (islands)]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1943.
During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], and northern New Guinea, as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].[34] After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island]] and [[Mindoro]].[34]
Although the ship was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey was one of several ships damaged by [[Typhoon Cobra]] that hit Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.]]'s Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944.
The Third Fleet lost three [[Destroyer]] and over 800 men during the typhoon.
The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the [[Hangar deck]].
Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945.
From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview]], at the rank of [[Lieutenant commander]].[24]
Ford received the following military awards: the [[American Campaign Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine [[Service star]] (for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two 3⁄16" bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].[31] He was honorably discharged in February 1946.[24][36]
"I came back a converted [[Internationalism (politics)]]", Ford wrote, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism]].
Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973.
As an editorial in [[The New York Times]] described him, Ford "saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career."[39] Appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]] two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense]].
Ford described his philosophy as "a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy."[40] He voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]],[41][42] [[Civil Rights Act of 1960]],[43][44] [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],[45][46] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]],[47][48] as well as the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].[49][50][51] Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a "Congressman's Congressman".[52]
In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the [[U.S. Senate]] or the [[Governor of Michigan]].
Rather, his ambition was to become [[United States Speaker of the House of Representatives]],[53] which he called "the ultimate achievement.
Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F.
Kennedy]] of President [[John F.
Kennedy]].[54] Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].
He and [[Earl Warren]] also interviewed [[Jack Ruby]], Oswald's killer.
According to a 1963 [[FBI]] memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, [[Cartha DeLoach]], about the panel's activities.[55][56][57] In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions.[58]
After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as minority leader.[59] The members of the Republican caucus that encouraged and eventually endorsed Ford to run as the House minority leader were later known as the "[[Young Turks (U.S. politics)]]".
Rumsfeld]] from [[Illinois's 13th congressional district]], who later on would serve in Ford's administration as the [[White House Chief of Staff]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense]].[60]
With a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the "[[Great Society]]".
During the first session of the [[Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.[61]
In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war.
Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections]] produced a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans.
As minority leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies.
After [[Richard Nixon]] was elected president in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda.
Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]].
Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue sharing]] program for state and local governments.[66] Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).[59][67]
For the past decade, Ford had been unsuccessfully working to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber so that he could become [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].
He promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976.[31] However, on October 10, 1973, [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned from the vice presidency.[68] According to The New York Times, Nixon "sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement." The advice was unanimous.
House Speaker [[Carl Albert]] recalled later, "We gave Nixon no choice but Ford."[39] Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the vice presidency would be "a nice conclusion" to his career.[31] Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had been implemented.
The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27.
[[1973 United States vice presidential confirmation]] in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president.[24]
Ford became vice president as the [[Watergate scandal]] was unfolding.
On August 1, 1974, [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford to tell him to prepare for the presidency.[24] At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle]] in Washington, D.C. However, "Al Haig asked to come over and see me", Ford later said, "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation.
When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency, taking the oath of office in the [[East Room (White House)]] of the White House.
This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without being [[United States presidential election]] to the presidency or the vice presidency.
On August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to fill the vice presidency he had vacated.[73] Rockefeller's top competitor had been [[George H.
Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as [[Henry Kissinger]].
Some, including [[Barry Goldwater]], voted against him.[74]
On September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional [[Pardon]] for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president.[75][76][77] In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation "is a tragedy in which we all have played a part.
Critics derided the move and said a "[[Corrupt bargain]]" had been struck between the two men,[16] in which Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, elevating Ford to the presidency.
Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after the pardon.[79] According to [[Bob Woodward]], Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford.
He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared.[80] Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[1976 United States presidential election]], an observation with which Ford agreed.[80] In an editorial at the time, The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a "profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence".[39] On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon.
He was the first sitting president since [[Abraham Lincoln]] to testify before the [[United States House of Representatives]].[81][82]
In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President Nixon by name, referring to him in public as "my predecessor" or "the former president." When Ford was pressed on the matter on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent [[Fred Barnes (journalist)]] recalled that he replied "I just can't bring myself to do it."[83]
United States]], a 1915 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.[84] In 2001, the [[John F.
Kennedy [[Profile in Courage Award]] to Ford for his pardon of Nixon.[85] In presenting the award to Ford, Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proven Ford to have made the correct decision.[86]
On September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional [[Amnesty]] program for military deserters and Vietnam War [[Draft dodger]] who had fled to countries such as Canada.
The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military.[87] The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters[88] established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in [[Military discharge]] status.
[[Proclamation 4483]] came in the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter]].[89]
When Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's [[Cabinet of the United States]].
During his brief administration, he replaced all members except [[United States Secretary of State]] Kissinger and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William E.
Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the "[[Halloween Massacre (Ford administration)]]".
One of Ford's appointees, [[William Thaddeus Coleman Jr.]]—the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]]—was the second Black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after [[Robert C.
Bush as [[United States Ambassador to China#List of chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing]] to the People's Republic of China in 1974, and then [[Director of Central Intelligence]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in late 1975.[91]
Ford's transition chairman and first Chief of Staff was former congressman and ambassador [[Donald Rumsfeld]].
In 1975, Rumsfeld was named by Ford as the youngest-ever [[United States Secretary of Defense]].
Ford chose a young [[Wyoming]] politician, [[Dick Cheney]], to replace Rumsfeld as his new Chief of Staff; Cheney became the [[Campaign manager]] for Ford's [[1976 United States presidential election]].[92]
The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats.
Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865–1869).[93] Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, [[Richard Vander Veen]], who defeated [[Robert VanderLaan]].
In the [[1974 United States Senate elections]], the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.[94]
The [[Economy of the United States]] was a great concern during the Ford administration.
One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by [[Executive Order (United States)]] on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board.[95] In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to "Whip Inflation Now".
As part of this program, he urged people to wear "[[Whip Inflation Now]]" buttons.[96] At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment.[95] To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending.
Over the next nine days, 101,240 Americans mailed in "WIN" pledges.[95] In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a [[Public relations]] gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems.[98] The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals.
The federal budget ran a [[Government budget deficit]] every year Ford was president.[101] Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight [[Public budgeting]], Ford signed the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] of 1975, which established [[Special education]] throughout the United States.
The economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst [[1973–75 recession]] since the [[Great Depression]] four decades earlier.[103] The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.[104] In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation.[99] Ford was criticized for abruptly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction.
In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8 billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts.[95] In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these [[Income tax]] rebates as part of the [[Tax Reduction Act of 1975]].
When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, [[List of mayors of New York City]] [[Abraham Beame]] was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout.
The incident prompted the New York [[New York Daily News]]' famous headline "Ford to City: Drop Dead", referring to a speech in which "Ford declared flatly ...
Ford was confronted with a potential [[Swine flu]] [[Pandemic]].
In the early 1970s, an [[Influenza]] strain [[H1N1]] shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans.
On February 5, 1976, an [[United States Army]] recruit at [[Fort Dix]] mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] announced that "swine flu" was the cause.
Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be [[Vaccination]].[108] Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976.[109] Ford and his family were publicly vaccinated before cameras in October, shortly before he lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter.[110]
Ford was an outspoken supporter of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], issuing Presidential Proclamation no.
Wade]], which he opposed.[113] Ford came under criticism when First Lady Betty Ford entered the debate over abortion during an [[Betty Ford's August 1975 60 Minutes interview]], in which she stated that Roe v.
Wade was a "great, great decision".[114] During his later life, Ford would identify as [[Pro-choice]].[115]
Ford continued the détente policy with both the [[Soviet Union]] and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War.
Still in place from the Nixon administration was the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty]] (SALT).[116] The thawing relationship brought about by [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975.[117] The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords[118] with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the [[Helsinki Watch]], an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into [[Human Rights Watch]].[119]
Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the [[Group of Seven]] (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada.
In November 1975, Ford adopted the global [[Human population control]] recommendations of [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] – a [[National security directive]] initially commissioned by Nixon – as United States policy in the subsequent NSDM 314.[121][122] The plan explicitly states the goal was population control and not improving the lives of individuals despite instructing organizers to "emphasize development and improvements in the quality of life of the poor", later explaining the projects were "primarily for other reasons".[123][124] Upon approving the plan, Ford stated "United States leadership is essential to combat population growth, to implement the World Population Plan of Action and to advance United States security and overseas interests".[125] Population control policies were adopted to protect American economic and military interests, with the memorandum arguing that [[Population growth]] in [[Developing countries]] resulted with such nations gaining global political power, that more citizens posed a risk to accessing foreign natural resources while also making American businesses vulnerable to governments seeking to fund a growing population, and that younger generations born would be prone to [[Anti-establishment]] behavior, increasing political instability.[121][125][126]
As South Vietnam collapsed, an anti-communist [[Indonesia]] was seen as essential by the United States.
Good relations with the Indonesian government were considered more important than the decolonization process in [[East Timor]].[127][128] The Ford administration gave the [[New Order (Indonesia)]] in [[Indonesia]] economic and military support, even as it [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]] and [[East Timor genocide]] that killed close to a third of the population.[129] One day prior to the invasion, Ford and Kissinger met with Suharto, and they assured him that relations with Indonesia would remain strong regardless of Indonesia's actions and that it would not object to the [[Annexation]] of East Timor.[130]
The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance.
In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey.
In the continuing [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[Shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress.
Ford considered it "stalling" and wrote, "Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell."[131] During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:
It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms sales to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives.[134] The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli "war of nerves" or "test of wills".[135] After much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II) was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed.
One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing [[Vietnam War]].
American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on January 27, 1973.
The accords declared a cease-fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American [[POW]].
The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South.
The agreements were negotiated by [[US National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and North Vietnamese [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam]] member [[Lê Đức Thọ]].
South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement.
In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long Province]].
General [[Trần Văn Trà]] sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion.[138]
Javits]] offered "...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid".[116] President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country.[139] Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at [[Tulane University]].
1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 [[Vietnamese people]] and third-country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Frequent Wind]].
Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]].
The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[International waters]].[142] The main crisis was the [[Mayaguez incident]].
In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters.[143] Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the Mayaguez sailors were being released.
In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.[144] Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.[145] The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] wall in Washington, D.C.
In [[Sacramento, California]], on September 5, 1975, [[Lynette Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol]] at Ford and pulled the trigger at [[Point-blank range]].[148][149] As she did, [[Larry Buendorf]],[150] a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody.
As he left the [[St. Francis Hotel]] in downtown San Francisco, [[Sara Jane Moore]], standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, fired a [[.38 Special]] at him.
The shot missed Ford by a few feet.[148][152] Before she fired a second round, retired Marine [[Oliver Sipple]] grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded.
In 1975, Ford appointed [[John Paul Stevens]] as [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] to replace retiring Justice [[William O.
Stevens had been a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], appointed by President Nixon.[154] During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached.[155] After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues.[156] Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens.
Ford appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the [[United States district court]].[158]
Former [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and the party's [[American conservatism]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]].
(Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]].) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous [[United States presidential primary]], including [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Indiana]], and [[California]], but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[Missouri]].
The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more [[American liberalism]] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]].[159]
[[Chevy Chase]] often did [[Physical comedy]] on [[Saturday Night Live]], [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)#Episodes]], who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term.
Ford's 1976 election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the [[United States Bicentennial]].
The Washington, D.C. [[Fireworks]] display on the [[Independence Day (United States)]] was presided over by the President and televised nationally.[161] On July 7, 1976, the President and First Lady served as hosts at a White House state dinner for [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] of the United Kingdom, which was televised on the [[PBS]] network.
The 200th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for "reconciliation, not recrimination" and "reconstruction, not rancor" between the United States and those who would pose "threats to peace".[162] Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to "basic American virtues".[163]
Televised [[1976 United States presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election.
However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner [[Max Frankel]] was visibly incredulous at the response.[165]
In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 [[Electoral College (United States)]] compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford.[166]
Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[United States presidential inauguration]] by praising the outgoing president, saying, "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."[167]
Ford successfully invested in oil with [[Marvin Davis]], which later provided an income for Ford's children.[168]
In January 1977, he became the president of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]] in [[Philadelphia]], then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.[169] Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M.
During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat#Burial]] of [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981.[172] Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, [[Rosalynn Carter]], visited the Fords' home frequently.[173] Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] in 2002.
Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees.
He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian [[Bob Hope]], a longtime friend.
In 1977, he shot a [[Hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].
Ford Institute of Public Policy at [[Albion College]] in [[Albion, Michigan]], to give undergraduates training in public policy.
Ford Library]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], on the north campus of his alma mater, the [[University of Michigan]],[174] followed in September by the [[Gerald R.
Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in [[1980 United States presidential election]], forgoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter.
Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, as well as [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio and [[Bill Clements]] of Texas to make the race.
After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful.
Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented "co-presidency",[178] giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and [[Alan Greenspan]] as Treasury Secretary).
On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the [[Federal Reserve Board]] due to his appointing of most of its members: "President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin.
Following the [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan]], Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for [[Thomas Kean]] that criminals who use firearms should get the death penalty in the event someone is injured with the weapon.[183]
In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against succumbing to [[Wall Street]] demands and follow his own agenda for the economic policies of the US during an appearance on [[Good Morning America]]: "He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic future of this country is going to be.
Ford founded the annual [[AEI World Forum]] in 1982, and joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] as a distinguished fellow.
He was also awarded an [[List of recipients of honorary degrees from Central Connecticut State University]][187] on March 23, 1988.
During an August 1982 fundraising reception, Ford stated his opposition to a constitutional amendment requiring the US to have a balanced budget, citing a need to elect "members of the House and Senate who will immediately when Congress convenes act more responsibly in fiscal matters."[188] Ford was a participant in the 1982 midterm elections, traveling to [[Tennessee]] in October of that year to help Republican candidates.[189]
In January 1984, a letter signed by Ford and Carter and urging world leaders to extend their failed effort to end world hunger was released and sent to [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]].[190]
In 1987, Ford testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] in favor of [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] judge and former [[Solicitor General of the United States]] [[Robert Bork]] after Bork was [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination]] by President Reagan to be an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]].[191] Bork's nomination was rejected by a vote of 58–42.[192]
By 1988, Ford was a member of several corporate boards including Commercial Credit, Nova Pharmaceutical, [[Pullman Company]], [[Tesoro Corporation]], and Tiger International, Inc.[193] Ford also became an honorary director of [[Citigroup]], a position he held until his death.[194]
In October 1990, Ford appeared in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] with [[Bob Hope]] to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the birth of former president [[Dwight D.
In April 1991, Ford joined former presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Jimmy Carter]], in supporting the [[Brady Bill]].[196] Three years later, he wrote to the [[United States House of Representatives]], along with Carter and Reagan, in support of the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]].[197]
At the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], Ford compared the election cycle to his 1976 loss to Carter and urged attention be paid to electing a Republican Congress: "If it's change you want on Nov.
For nearly 40 years, Democratic majorities have held to the time-tested New Deal formula, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect." (The Republicans would later win both Houses of Congress at the [[1994 United States elections]].)[198]
In April 1997, Ford joined President [[Bill Clinton]], former president Bush, and [[Nancy Reagan]] in signing the "Summit Declaration of Commitment" in advocating for participation by private citizens in solving domestic issues within the United States.[199]
On January 20, 1998, during an interview at his Palm Springs home, Ford said the Republican Party's nominee in the 2000 presidential election would lose if the party turned [[Ultra-conservative]] in their ideals: "If we get way over on the hard right of the political spectrum, we will not elect a Republican President.
We ought to learn from the Democrats: when they were running [[Ultraliberalism#Left-liberalism]] candidates, they didn't win."[200]
In the prelude to the impeachment of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former president Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at [[Emory University]].[201]
Period." He became the highest-ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.[202] He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition, which [[The New York Times]] described as "a group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R.
On November 22, 2004, New York Republican governor [[George Pataki]] named Ford and the other living former presidents (Carter, George H.
Bush and Bill Clinton) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the [[World Trade Center site]].
In a pre-recorded [[News embargo]] with [[Bob Woodward]] of [[The Washington Post]] in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed "very strongly" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to [[Iraq War]], calling it a "big mistake" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been president.
On April 4, 1990, Ford was admitted to [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] for surgery to replace his left knee, orthopedic surgeon Robert Murphy saying, "Ford's entire left knee was replaced with an artificial joint, including portions of the adjacent femur, or thigh bone, and tibia, or leg bone."[206]
Ford suffered two minor strokes at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], but made a quick recovery after being admitted to [[Hahnemann University Hospital]].[207][208] In January 2006, he spent 11 days at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] near his residence at [[Rancho Mirage, California]], for treatment of [[Pneumonia]].[209] On April 23, 2006, President [[George W.
While vacationing in [[Vail, Colorado]], Ford was hospitalized for two days in July 2006 for shortness of breath.[210] On August 15 he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital of the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], for testing and evaluation.
On August 21, it was reported that he had been fitted with a [[Artificial pacemaker]].
On August 25, he underwent an [[Angioplasty]] procedure at the Mayo Clinic.
Ford died on December 26, 2006, at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], of arteriosclerotic [[Cerebrovascular disease]] and diffuse [[Arteriosclerosis]].
He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe [[Aortic stenosis]] and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves.[213] At the time of his death, Ford was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age]], having lived 93 years and 165 days (45 days longer than Ronald Reagan, whose record he surpassed).[31] He died on the 34th anniversary of President [[Harry S.
Truman]]'s death; he was the last surviving member of the [[Warren Commission]].[214]
On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. president to [[Lying in state#United States]] in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]].[215] A state funeral and memorial services were held at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, January 2, 2007.
One of the songs selected by Ford during the procession was the University of Michigan fight song, as it was a favorite of his that he preferred to be played during his presidency.[218] After his death in December 2006, the [[University of Michigan Marching Band]] played the school's fight song for him one final time, for his last ride from the [[Gerald R.
The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a [[Statue of Gerald Ford]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], replacing [[Zachariah Chandler]].
On October 15, 1948, Ford married [[Elizabeth Bloomer]] (1918–2011) at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids.[222]
Bloomer, who was originally from Grand Rapids herself, had been living in New York City for several years, where she had been working as a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model, and as a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company.
They delayed their wedding until shortly before the [[1948 United States House of Representatives elections]] because, as [[The New York Times]] reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer."[222]
The couple had four children: Michael Gerald, born in 1950; John Gardner (known as Jack), born in 1952; [[Steven Ford]], born in 1956; and [[Susan Ford Bales]], born in 1957.[148]
Ford was a member of several civic and fraternal organizations, including the [[United States Junior Chamber]] (Jaycees), [[American Legion]], [[AMVETS]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[Sons of the Revolution]],[223] [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], and was an alumnus of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] at Michigan.
Ford was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] on September 30, 1949.[224] He later said in 1975, "When I took my obligation as a master mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order.
Ford was also a member of the [[Shriners]] and the [[Royal Order of Jesters]]; both being [[Masonic bodies#Other affiliated bodies]] of Freemasonry.[229]
He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word", said [[Martha Griffiths]].[231]
According to the [[Gallup Organization]], Ford took office with the fourth-highest [[Approval rating]] for a president following their inauguration, but the trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by the pardon of Nixon and his ratings fell an unprecedented 21 points.[232][231] By January 1975, his disapproval rating had surpassed his approval rating.[233]
In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded [[Everyman]].
[[Henry Kissinger]] described him as "as close to a normal human being as we'll ever get in that office".[234] Other pieces of the everyman image were attributed to his inevitable comparison with Nixon, his Midwestern stodginess, and his self-deprecation.[230]
An incident in 1975, when Ford tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by [[Chevy Chase]] on [[Saturday Night Live]], cementing Ford's image as a klutz.[231][235][236] Additionally, an incident in April 1976, when Ford bit into a still shuck-wrapped tamale, a culinary faux pas, made national news and contributed to the image of Ford as a chronic bumbler.[237] The incident has become a cautionary tale about the hazards of eating on the campaign trail.[238][239]
Ford has notably been portrayed in two television productions which included a central focus on his wife: the [[Emmy Awards]]-winning 1987 [[American Broadcasting System]] [[Biographical film]] [[Television movie]] [[The Betty Ford Story]],[240] and the 2022 [[Showtime (TV network)]] television series [[The First Lady (American TV series)]].[241]
