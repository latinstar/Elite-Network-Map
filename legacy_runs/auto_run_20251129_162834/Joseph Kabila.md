Joseph Kabila Kabange (/kæˈbiːlə/ kab-EE-lə, French: [ʒozɛf kabila]; born 4 June 1971) is a Congolese politician and former military officer who served as the fourth [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 2001 to 2019.
He took office ten days[1] after the assassination of his father, President [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] in the context of the [[Second Congo War]].
He founded the [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]] (PPRD) in 2002 and was allowed to remain in power after the 2003 [[Pretoria Accord]] ended the war as the president of the country's new [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
He was elected as president in [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] and re-elected in [[2011 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] for a second term.[2] Since stepping down after the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], Kabila, as a former president, serves as a [[Senator for life]].[3][4] Kabila was the country's second-longest serving president.[5]
Kabila is credited with ending the Second Congo War and restoring relative stability to most of the country,[5][6] though conflict continued in eastern DR Congo against rebel forces supported by neighboring [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]].
The size of the [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] increased by five times during his presidency.[6] But economic growth slowed down in the later years,[7] and it had been very unequal.
The majority of DR Congo's population still lived below the [[Poverty threshold]] by the time he left office.[5][6] He helped organize electoral institutions and in 2006 presided over the DRC's first multi-party election in decades,[6] though both that and his victory in 2011 faced accusations of electoral fraud and saw protests.[8] He led an [[Authoritarianism]] government that was known for embezzlement, corruption, and human rights violations, including security forces killing protestors.[5][9] The United States has sanctioned associates of Kabila for corruption and undermining democracy.[6][9]
Talk focused on the need for a census before holding elections.[10] Kabila's popularity declined and he also faced growing pressure from the international community to give up power.[7][11] An agreement was reached with the influential [[Episcopal Conference of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to appoint a new government and prepare to hold elections.[7] In August 2018, Kabila announced that he would step down and not seek a third term in the December 2018 general election.[12] Kabila was succeeded by [[Félix Tshisekedi]] in the country's first [[Peaceful transition of power]] since independence.
Independent observers concluded that Tshisikedi lost heavily to another candidate, [[Martin Fayulu]], and that Kabila had fixed the official result for the candidate most likely to be most helpful to him in the latter's post-presidency period.[13][14]
Joseph Kabila Kabange and his twin sister [[Jaynet Kabila]] were born on 4 June 1971.
The twins were born in Hewa Bora II, a village in the [[Maquis of Fizi]], in the present-day [[South Kivu]], in eastern DRC.
Rumors have abounded that Kabila was actually born in [[Tanzania]], which would make him a citizen of that country.[15] He is the son of long time rebel, former AFDL leader and president of the DRC [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] and Sifa Mahanya.[16]
Due to his father's status as an enemy of Zairean strongman [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Kabila posed as a Tanzanian in his school years to avoid detection by Zairean intelligence agents.[15]
Following high school, Kabila followed a military curriculum in [[Tanzania]], then at [[Makerere University]] in Uganda.[15] In October 1996, Laurent-Désiré Kabila launched the [[First Congo War]] with his newly formed army, the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (AFDL).
Joseph Kabila became the commander of an AFDL unit that included "[[Kadogos]]" (child soldiers) and likely played a key role in major battles on the road to Kinshasa, but his exact whereabouts during the war have been difficult to establish.[15] Joseph Kabila appears to have been present at the liberation of [[Kisangani]] where media reports identified him as commander of the rebel force that took the city after four days of intense fighting.[17]
Following the AFDL's victory, and Laurent-Désiré Kabila's rise to the presidency, Joseph Kabila went on to get further training at the [[PLA National Defense University]], in Beijing, China.
When he returned from China, Kabila was awarded the rank of major-general, and appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (FAC), in 1998.
He was later, in 2000, appointed Chief of Staff of the [[Land Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], a position he held until the elder President Kabila's assassination in January 2001.[18] As chief of staff, he was one of the main military leaders in charge of government troops during the time of the [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003).[15]
Joseph Kabila rose to the presidency on 26 January 2001 after the [[Assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the world's first head of government born in the 1970s.[19] Aged 29, he was considered young and inexperienced, and reportedly did not want to become the president, but was the only candidate that his father's advisers could agree on.[9] In his inauguration speech, Joseph Kabila spoke about the need to "restore peace and national communion," restart the negotiations that stalled under his predecessor, return to democracy, and to liberalize the economy.[20]
Under international pressure from South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] and UN special envoy [[Moustapha Niasse]], the final peace settlement was based on the [[Sun City Agreement]] signed at the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in [[Sun City, South Africa]], which nominally ended the [[Second Congo War]].
A [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was set up under him, including the leaders of the country's two main rebel groups, the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo]] and [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]], as [[Vice Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
The implementation of the peace agreement took place with international monitoring, including with the presence of the largest United Nations [[MONUSCO]] in its history.
The first cabinet was set up in June 2003, followed by the National Assembly and the Senate in the next month.[22] The [[Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] (CEI) was created in 2004, and also that year the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo nationality law]] was passed to address previous disputes regarding the issue.[23] The parliament began working on the [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in February 2005, and passed a draft in May 2005, in the presence of both Kabila and Thabo Mbeki.
It created an independent judiciary and a [[Semi-presidential republic]] where a prime minister is appointed by the president but must have the support of the parliamentary majority.[24]
When the slow process of passing an electoral law led to talks of elections being postponed by six months in early 2005, there was a brief split within the government with the MLC, which also involved delays in appointments to government offices, though it was remedied after Kabila spoke to Vice President [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].
Meanwhile, the historic opposition party [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress]] called for protests, and some newspapers in Kinshasa spoke of a "[[Orange Revolution]]", but planned demonstrations by UPDS were blocked by police.[25] Between June and December 2005, the electoral commission was able to register 25 million voters across the DRC despite the poor state of the infrastructure.
This was in preparation for the country's first free electoral expression since [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]], the [[2005 Democratic Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum]], held at the end of the year.
Kabila established a separate "military household" outside of the FARDC general staff, which had been founded in 2003, and his own [[Republican Guard (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] that received better pay and equipment than the regular army.
On 28 March 2004, an apparent coup attempt or mutiny around the capital [[Kinshasa]], allegedly by members of the former guard of former president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] (who had been ousted by Kabila's father in 1997 and died in the same year), failed.[28] On 11 June 2004, [[2004 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup attempt]] led by Major [[Eric Lenge]] allegedly attempted to take power and announced on state radio that the transitional government was suspended, but were defeated by loyalist troops.[29][30]
The president's visit to [[Kisangani]], which had been occupied by rebel and foreign troops, was portrayed as a demonstration of the restoration of stability and unity to the country.
Kabila ran for the presidency as an independent, though the [[Alliance of the Presidential Majority]] was formed to support his campaign, which included his [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]] (PPRD) and about 30 other parties.
A [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] was held on 30 July 2006, having been delayed from an earlier date in June.[34] The new constitution lowered the minimum age of presidential candidates from 35 to 30; Kabila turned 35 shortly before the election.
According to widely disputed provisional results announced on 20 August, Kabila won 45% of the vote; his main opponent, vice-president and former rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]], won 20%.
The irregularities surrounding the elections results prompted a run-off vote between Kabila and Bemba which was held on 29 October.[36] On 15 November, the electoral commission announced the official results and Kabila was declared the winner, with 58.05% of the vote.[37] These results were confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 November 2006, and Kabila was inaugurated on 6 December 2006 as the country's newly elected president.[38] Both international and national observers stated that the election had been generally free and fair, while noting some irregularities.[39] He named [[Antoine Gizenga]], who placed third in the first round of the presidential election (and then backed Kabila in the second round) as prime minister on 30 December.[40]
One of the major economic projects of his first presidency, continuing into the second, was the [[Sicomines]] (Sino-Congolais des Mines) "resources-for-infrastructure" agreement with [[China]].
The DRC signed a [[Memorandum of understanding]] in September 2007 that granted a consortium owned by the [[China Railway Engineering Corporation]] the majority of shares in a joint venture called Sicomines, while the DRC's [[Gécamines]] owned the rest.[42] Sicomines would be given mining licenses in the [[Katanga Province]], with CREC agreeing to build of infrastructure in exchange, and to secure US$6.5 billion from Chinese banks to finance it.[32] The agreement marked the first time that China became a major partner of the DRC[43] and was the largest deal of its kind in the Congo's history.[44]
After the [[International Monetary Fund]] and civil society groups became concerned about the DRC's ability to repay the loans, negotiations continued and the final deal was signed in 2009.
After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and [[Mbuji-Mayi]], where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate [[Étienne Tshisekedi]].[47] Official observers from the [[Carter Center]] reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results.
They described the election as lacking credibility.[48] On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in [[Infrastructure]] and public services.
In January 2012, [[Catholicism]] bishops in DR Congo also condemned the elections, complaining of "treachery, lies and terror", and calling on the election commission to correct "serious errors".[50]
On 19 January [[2015 Congolese protests]].
The protests began following the announcement of a proposed law that would allow Kabila to remain in power until a national census could be conducted (elections had been planned for [[2016 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]]).[51][52] By Wednesday 21 January clashes between police and protesters had claimed at least 42 lives, although the government claimed only 15 people had been killed.[51]
[[Moïse Katumbi]] announced in October 2015 that he would leave the ruling party due to disagreements over the scheduled election.[53][54]
[[Jaynet Kabila]], the sister of Kabila, was named in the [[Panama Papers]].
Harsh demonstrations erupted on 20 April 2016 in [[Lubumbashi]], one of Congo's biggest cities.[56]
When [[Moise Katumbi]], the former governor of [[Katanga Province]] in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now an opposition figure, announced that he was running for president in an election that was supposed to be held by the end of 2016, his house was surrounded by security forces wanting to arrest him.[57]
Although Kabila's forces have scored an important victory against one large [[Rebellion]] group, the [[March 23 Movement]], in 2013, many other armed groups have splintered into dangerous movements.
And by 2016 new ones had risen, like militias in the [[Nyunzu Territory]] that have killed hundreds of people.[56]
According to the [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], President Kabila should not be allowed to serve more than two terms.
On 19 September 2016, massive protests rocked [[Kinshasa]] calling for him to step down as legally mandated.
On 29 September 2016, the [[Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] announced that the election would not be held until early 2018.
Partially in response to the delayed election, the United States issued [[United States embargoes]] against two members of Kabila's inner circle, [[John Numbi]] and [[Gabriel Amisi Kumba]], on 28 September.
Maman Sidikou, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for DR Congo and head of [[MONUSCO]], said that a tipping point into uncontrollable violence could come about very quickly if the political situation is not normalised.[63]
Kabila's second term as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo was due to end on 20 December 2016.[64] A statement issued by his spokesperson on 19 December 2016, stated that Joseph Kabila would remain in post until a new president is in place following elections which will not be held until at least April 2018.[64] Kabila subsequently installed a new cabinet led by [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] [[Samy Badibanga]], resulting in [[December 2016 Congolese protests]] in which at least 40 people were killed.[65] Under articles 75 and 76 of the [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo]], should the office of the president become vacant, the Chairman of the [[Senate (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]], presently [[Léon Kengo]] would assume the presidency in an acting capacity.
On 23 December, an agreement was proposed between the main opposition group and the Kabila government under which the latter agreed not to alter the constitution and to leave office before the end of 2017.[66] Under the agreement opposition leader [[Étienne Tshisekedi]] will oversee that the deal is implemented and the country's [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] will be appointed by the opposition.[66]
On December 30, 2018 the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election]] to determine the successor to Kabila was held.
Kabila endorsed [[Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary]], his former interior minister.[68] On January 10, 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate [[Félix Tshisekedi]] as the winner of the vote.[69]
Since leaving the presidency, Kabila has made [[Nsele Valley Park]] his main residence.
In May 2021, Tshisekedi called for a review of mining contracts signed with [[China]] by Kabila,[72] especially the Sicomines multibillion [[China–Democratic Republic of the Congo relations#Sicomines]].[73][74]
In February 2025, Kabila criticised President Tshisekedi for mishandling the [[M23 campaign (2022–present)]] through poor governance and accused him of seeking to become "absolute ruler of the country" by suppressing political opposition.[75] Tshisekedi accused Kabila of supporting the M23 rebels at the [[61st Munich Security Conference]] that same month.
In early March 2025, a cabinet member in the Tshisekedi administration, Jean-Pierre Bemba, also accused Kabila of supporting M23 and the [[Congo River Alliance]], as well as the Mobondo militia in the [[Western DR Congo clashes]].
He also attended the funeral of Namibian president of [[Sam Nujoma]], where he spoke to foreign leaders.
In April 2025, Kabila, who went on a self-imposed exile in 2023, visited the M23-held city of [[Goma]], with an aide saying that he would "participate in peace efforts".[79] In response, the Congolese government suspended Kabila's [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]], citing his "overt" activism,[80][81] while the Senate voted to lift his parliamentary immunity.[82]
He was tried and convicted in absentia.[83] On 16 October, he appeared at an event in [[Nairobi]], Kenya alongside other Congolese opposition politicians.[84]
Further scrutiny emerged through a [[Bloomberg News]] investigation, which, drawing on leaked banking records, alleged that members of Kabila’s family had received tens of millions of dollars in illicit payments from Chinese firms connected to the Sicomines mining venture.
These disclosures formed part of the broader Congo Hold-Up investigation—an extensive leak comprising over 3.5 million internal documents from [[BGFIBank Group]].
The leak, initiated by the French investigative outlet [[Mediapart]] and the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), included bank statements, emails, contracts, invoices, and corporate records, painting a troubling picture of systemic financial misconduct at the highest levels of power.[44]
Kabila married [[Olive Lembe di Sita]], on 1 June 2006.
The wedding ceremonies took place on 17 June 2006.[86] Kabila and his wife have a daughter, born in 2001, named Sifa, after Kabila's mother, and a son born in 2008 named Laurent-Désiré Jr.[8] He owns property outside of Kinshasa, including 71,000 hectares of farmland,[7] and his family fully or partially owns 80 companies across almost every industry in the DRC, including in mining.[5][7] Kabila's hobbies include watching the [[National Basketball Association]], reading,[6] playing [[PlayStation 4]], and driving his motorcycles.[9]
As Kabila is an [[Anglican]][8] Protestant and Lembe di Sita is Catholic, the wedding ceremonies were [[Ecumenical]]; they were officiated by both the Catholic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa]], [[Frédéric Etsou-Nzabi-Bamungwabi]], and [[Pierre Marini Bodho]] – presiding bishop of the [[Church of Christ in Congo]], the umbrella church for most denominations in the Congo, known within the country simply as "The Protestant Church".
In July 2021, Joseph Kabila finished his master's degree, getting the certification from the [[University of Johannesburg]] in South Africa.
