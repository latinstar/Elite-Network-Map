Hifikepunye Lucas Pohamba (born 18 August 1935) is a Namibian politician who served as the second [[President of Namibia]] from 21 March 2005 to 21 March 2015.
He won the [[2004 Namibian presidential election]] overwhelmingly as the candidate of [[SWAPO]] and was reelected in [[2009 Namibian presidential election]].
He is a recipient of the [[Ibrahim Prize]].
He was [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Namibia)]] from 1990 to 1995, [[Ministry of Fisheries (Namibia)]] from 1995 to 1997, [[Minister without portfolio]] from 1997 to 2000, and Minister of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation from 2001 to 2005.
Hifikepunye Pohamba was born on 18 August 1935 in [[Okanghudi]], then part of [[South West Africa]], in an area then known as [[Ovamboland]] (today in the [[Ohangwena Region]] of Namibia).
He completed his primary school education in the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] Holy Cross Mission school in [[Onamunhama]], and in 1956 took up work at the [[Tsumeb]] mine.[1][2][3]
Pohamba was active in the [[Ovamboland People's Organization]].
When this national liberation movement transformed into [[SWAPO]] in 1960, Pohamba was a founding member of the organization's new incarnation and left his job in the mine to work as a full-time organizer for the group.[1][4]
He traveled to [[Dar es Salaam]] to the newly-independent [[Tanganyika (1961–1964)]] (today part of [[Tanzania]]) where he met [[Sam Nujoma]], later Namibia's first president, for the first time.
On his way he was arrested in [[Rhodesia]] (today [[Zimbabwe]]) and was jailed in [[Bulawayo]], then deported to [[Johannesburg]].
He went to [[Lusaka]] to set up SWAPO's [[Zambia]] office.
In 1971 SWAPO transferred Pohamba to [[Algeria]]; He became the movement's chief representative for northern Africa.
From 1981 to 1982 he studied politics in the [[Soviet Union]], and upon his return to Africa, he moved to [[Luanda]], [[Angola]], where SWAPO's headquarters was at that time.[2][1]
Pohamba headed SWAPO's 1989 election campaign[4] and was a SWAPO member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Namibia]], which was in place from November 1989 to March 1990,[7] before becoming a member of the [[National Assembly of Namibia]] at independence in March 1990.[1] He was [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Namibia)]] from March 1990 to 1995, [[Ministry of Fisheries (Namibia)]] from 1995 to 1997,[2][1] and [[Minister without portfolio]] from 1997 to March 2000.[2][8] He was elected as secretary-general of SWAPO in 1997 and as its vice-president in 2002.[5] On 26 January 2001, he was appointed as [[Ministry of Land Reform (Namibia)]] in addition to his above ministerial position,[9] in which position he remained until becoming president in 2005.
After becoming president, Pohamba also took over the chancellorship of the [[University of Namibia]] from Nujoma in November 2011.[10]
He received 213 votes out of 526 in the first round of voting; in the second round, held on 30 May, he won with 341 votes against 167 for [[Hidipo Hamutenya]], having received the support of nearly all of those who had backed third-place candidate [[Nahas Angula]] in the first round.[11] In the presidential election, held on 15/16 November 2004, Pohamba won with 76.44% of the vote,[12] in what has been described as a "landslide", but also denounced as flawed by the opposition.[13] He was backed by Nujoma, who was then serving his third five-year term; Pohamba has been described as Nujoma's hand-picked successor.[14] Pohamba took office as president on 21 March 2005[15] and has since distinguished himself by careful but decisive moves against corruption.
Nujoma said that he was "passing the torch and mantle of leadership to comrade Pohamba".[18] The congress also chose Pohamba as the party's only candidate for the [[2009 Namibian general election]].[19][20]
Pohamba was unable to stand for re-election in [[2014 Namibian general election]] due to constitutional term limits.
The election was again won overwhelmingly by SWAPO, and Pohamba was succeeded by [[Hage Geingob]] on 21 March 2015.
Pohamba has been married to [[Penehupifo Pohamba]] since 1983.
The couple owns farm Guinaspoh #41 near [[Otavi]].[24]
