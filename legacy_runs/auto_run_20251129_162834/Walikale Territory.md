Walikale Territory is a [[Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] situated in [[North Kivu]] Province, within the eastern region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DR Congo).
Its administrative headquarters are located in the town of [[Walikale]], which lies along [[National Road 3 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] between [[Bukavu]] and [[Lubutu]] ([[Maniema]] Province).
The territory occupies the Lowa River valley and is positioned approximately 135 km west of [[Goma]].[1]
Walikale is renowned for its [[Cassiterite]] deposits, a mineral refined into [[Tin]].
As of 2008, control over these resources was heavily contested due to the [[Kivu conflict]], with [[Warlord]] and armed factions dominating extraction activities.
The [[Bisie]] mine, one of the territory’s largest cassiterite sources, was under the authority of the renegade 85th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ([[FARDC]]), commanded by Colonel Samy Matumo, until early 2009.
Security challenges persist in Walikale, notably due to activities by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ([[FDLR]]).
In May 2009, the group launched attacks in Busurungi, a settlement near the border with [[South Kivu]] Province.[3] Busurungi and its surrounding area host approximately 7,000 residents, distributed across villages including Bunyamisimbwa, Kahunju, [[Kamanyola]], Kasebunga, [[Kitchanga]], Moka, Nyamimba, and Tuonane.[4]
The [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) originated as a political-military movement formed in 2000 by [[Hutu]] rebels involved in the [[Rwandan genocide]].
During the [[First Congo War]] (1996–1997), the Rwandan army dismantled refugee camps in eastern Congo that housed Hutu refugees, including former members of the [[Rwandan Defence Force]] (FAR).
In response, these rebels established the [[Armée de Libération du Rwanda]] (ALIR), a precursor to the FDLR, with the stated aim of overthrowing Rwanda’s post-genocide government and reinstating Hutu rule.
The group later adopted the alias FOCA ([[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]]), derived from the [[Kinyarwanda]] term for "liberators" or "saviors."
The group attempted alliances with local militias like the [[Mai-Mai]] Kifufua, Simba, and Tseka, but these partnerships proved unstable, often collapsing over disputes related to mining access.
The Mayi-Mayi Simba emerged during the 1964 [[Lumumbists]] rebellions, initially espousing communitarian ideals.
Active in northern Walikale near [[Lubutu]] and [[Maniema]] (Oninga region), their influence has waned in recent years.
Originally a self-defense militia against the Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple ([[National Congress for the Defence of the People]]) in South Kivu's Ufamando region, the Mayi-Mayi Kifuafua relocated to southern Walikale.
The Mayi-Mayi Tseka claims to defend Walikale from "[[Tutsi]] invaders" but primarily engages in illicit mining.
Covering 39.46% of [[Nord-Kivu]] Province, Walikale is the largest territory in the province by land area.[12]
Much of Walikale’s forests remain under the control of armed groups, including remnants of the [[Interahamwe]] (linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide) and militias formerly led by [[Laurent Nkunda]].
Since 1975, the territory’s southwestern corner has been incorporated into [[Kahuzi-Biéga National Park]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its biodiversity and endangered eastern lowland gorillas.[13]
Walikale Territory is represented in the [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] by two deputies:
In 2009, Rwandan President [[Paul Kagame]] and Congolese President [[Joseph Kabila]] launched Umoja Wetu ("Our Unity" in Swahili), a joint military offensive to dismantle the FDLR.
