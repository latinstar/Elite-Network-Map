The Associated Press (AP)[4] is an American [[Not-for-profit organization]] [[News agency]] headquartered in [[New York City]].
Founded in 1846, it operates as a [[Cooperative]], [[Unincorporated association]], and produces news reports that are distributed to its members, major U.S. daily newspapers and radio and television broadcasters.
Since the [[Pulitzer Prize]] was established in 1917, the AP has earned 59 of them, including 36 for photography.
The AP distributes its widely used [[AP Stylebook]], its [[AP poll]] tracking [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], and its election polls and results during [[Elections in the United States]].
It sponsors the [[National Football League]]'s annual awards.
By 2016, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters.[5] The AP operates 235 [[News bureau]] in 94 countries, and publishes in English, Spanish, and Arabic.[6] It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides twice hourly newscasts and daily sportscasts for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations.
As part of their cooperative agreement with the AP, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their [[Local news]] reports.
The Associated Press was formed in May 1846 by five daily newspapers in [[New York City]] to share the cost of transmitting news of the [[Mexican–American War]].[9] The venture was organized by [[Moses Yale Beach]] (1800–68), second publisher of [[The Sun (New York)]], joined by the [[New York Herald]], the [[New York Courier and Enquirer]], [[The Journal of Commerce]], and the [[New York Evening Express]].[10][11] Some historians[12] believe that the [[New-York Tribune]] joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849.
[[The New York Times]] became a member in September 1851.
Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[Price setting]] practices.
An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the [[Chicago Daily News]], revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it.
A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v.
Associated Press) holding that the AP was a [[Public utility]] and operating in [[Restraint of trade]] resulted in the AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.[13]
[[Melville Stone]], who had founded the Chicago Daily News in 1875, served as AP general manager from 1893 to 1921.
The AP adopted teletype for its New York service in 1914.[14] The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper, who served from 1925 to 1948 and who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War II]]), the Middle East.
Under Kent Cooper, the AP became a more prevalent member of a press agency cartel made up of [[Reuters]] and [[Havas]] (now [[Agence France-Presse]]).
He lobbied for the renegotiation of the tripartite contract binding the agencies and their respective news markets at the [[League of Nations]] in 1927, attempting to give the AP a more important place in competition with Reuters.[15] The first female AP member, [[Zell Hart Deming]], joined the AP in 1928.[16]
In 1935, the AP launched the [[Wirephoto]] network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken.
In 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in [[Associated Press v.
United States]][18] that the AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP.[19]
APTV merged with Worldwide Television News in 1998 to form [[Associated Press Television News]], which provides video to international broadcasters and websites.
In 2004, the AP moved its headquarters from its long-time home at [[50 Rockefeller Plaza]] to [[450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan.
In March 2024, [[Gannett]], the largest U.S. newspaper publisher as measured by total daily circulation, announced that effective March 25, 2024, it would no longer use content from the AP.
A spokesperson for AP said that they were "shocked and disappointed" by this development.[24] Newspaper chain [[McClatchy]] announced that it would also stop using some AP services.
The AP's multi-topic structure has resulted in web portals such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[MSN]] posting its articles, often relying on the AP as their first source for news coverage of breaking news items.
In 2007, Google announced that it was paying to receive AP content, to be displayed in [[Google News]],[25] interrupted from late 2009 to mid-2010 due to a licensing dispute.[26][27]
A 2017 study by [[NewsWhip]] revealed that AP content was more engaged with on [[Facebook]] than content from any individual English-language publisher.[28]
In June 2024, [[Axios (website)]] reported that the AP would be launching a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the goal of expanding state and local news, hoping to raise at least $100 million in philanthropic funds to address the "crisis in local news."[29][30][31]
The AP is governed by an elected [[Board of directors]].[44] Since 2022, the board's chairperson is [[Gracia C.
Martore]], former president and CEO of [[Tegna, Inc.]][45]
In 2025, restrictions preventing AP reporting in the U.S. were imposed by the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump#Actions against the media]].[46] In February 2025, two AP reporters were barred from covering several events at the [[White House]], because of the AP refusal to refer to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as the "Gulf of America", as directed by the White House.[47][48][49] The restrictions against AP were extended to other reporting opportunities such as in [[Air Force One]].
Following the decision, the White House released a statement asserting that "the ability to pose questions to the President of the United States in the [[Oval Office]] and aboard Air Force One constitutes a privilege extended to journalists, rather than a legally enshrined right."[53][54][55]
On April 8, 2025, Judge [[Trevor McFadden]] ruled that the White House must lift the access restrictions they placed on the AP while the AP v.
Budowich lawsuit moves forward.[56][57] On June 6, 2025, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] imposed a stay upon the lower court's order, allowing the White House to resume barring access to some media events.[58]
The research team further verifies the results by considering demographics, number of absentee ballots, and other political issues that may have an effect on the final results.[59] In 2018, the AP introduced a new system called [[AP VoteCast]], which was developed together with [[NORC at the University of Chicago]] in order to further improve the reliability of its data and overcome biases of its legacy [[Exit poll]].[62]
The AP conducts polls for numerous [[College athletics]] in the [[United States]].
The final poll for each season is released prior to the conclusion of the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]], so all data includes regular season games only.
The AP began its [[Major League Baseball]] Manager of the Year Award in 1959, for a manager in each league.[67] From 1984 to 2000, the award was given to one manager in all of MLB.[68] The winners were chosen by a national panel of AP baseball writers and radio men.
Every year, the AP releases the names of the winners of its [[Associated Press College Basketball Player of the Year]] and [[Associated Press College Basketball Coach of the Year]] awards.
It also honors a group of [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans]] players.
In 1994, London-based Associated Press Television (APTV) was founded to provide agency news material to television broadcasters.[69] In 1998, the AP purchased Worldwide Television News (WTN) from the ABC News division of [[The Walt Disney Company]], Nine Network Australia and ITN London.[69] The AP publishes 70,000 videos and 6,000 hours of live video per year, as of 2016[update].
The first modern edition was published in August 1977 by [[Lorenz Press]].
Afterwards, various paperback editions were published by different publishers, including, among others, Turtleback Books, [[Penguin Random House]]'s Laurel Press, [[Pearson plc]]'s [[Addison-Wesley]], and [[Hachette Books]]'s [[Perseus Books Group]] and [[Basic Books]].
Recent editions are released in several formats, including [[Paperback]] and flat-lying [[Coil binding]] editions, as well as a digital [[E-book]] edition and an online subscription version.
Additionally, the AP Stylebook also provides English grammar recommendations through social media, including [[Twitter]],[72] [[Facebook]],[73] [[Pinterest]],[74] and [[Instagram]].[75]
The AP [[Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy]] with [[Nazi Germany]] and gave it access to its photographic archives for its [[Antisemitism in Nazi propaganda]] [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany]].[78][79] AP also cooperated with the Nazi regime [[Censorship in Nazi Germany]].[80][78]
In 2017, the German historian Norman Domeier of the [[University of Vienna]] brought to wider attention the deal between the AP and the [[Government of Nazi Germany]] related to the interchange of press photos during the period in which [[Military history of the United States during World War II]].[81] This relationship involved the Bureau Laux, run by the [[Waffen-SS]] photographer [[Helmut Laux]].[81][82]
The mechanism for this interchange involved a courier flying to [[Lisbon]] and back each day transporting photos from and for Nazi Germany's wartime enemy, the United States, via [[Diplomatic pouch]].
The transactions were initially conducted at the AP bureau under Luiz Lupi in Lisbon, and from 1944, when the exchange via Lisbon took too long, also at the AP bureau in [[Stockholm]] under Eddie Shanke.
An estimated 40,000 photos were exchanged between the enemies in this way.[83] The AP was kicked out of Nazi Germany when [[American entry into World War II]] in December 1941.[82]
In his book Broken Spring: An American-Israeli Reporter's Close-up View of How Egyptians Lost Their Struggle for Freedom, former AP correspondent, [[Mark Lavie]], who is an American-Israeli Orthodox Jew, claimed that the editorial line of the Cairo bureau was that the conflict was Israel's fault and the Arabs and Palestinians were blameless.[84][85][86] Israeli journalist [[Matti Friedman]] accused the AP of killing a story he wrote about the "war of words", "between Israel and its critics in human rights organizations", in the aftermath of the [[Gaza War (2008–09)]].[84]
On September 29, 2000, the first day of the [[Second Intifada]], the AP published a photograph of a badly-bloodied young man behind whom a police officer could be seen with a baton raised in a menacing fashion; a gas station with Hebrew lettering could also be seen in the background.[87][88][89] The AP labelled it with the caption "An Israeli policeman and a Palestinian on the Temple Mount", and the picture and caption were subsequently published in several major American newspapers, including the [[The New York Times]].[90][87][89] In reality, the injured man in the photograph was a Jewish yeshiva student from Chicago named [[Tuvia Grossman]], and the police officer, a Druze named Gidon Tzefadi, was protecting Grossman from a Palestinian mob who had clubbed, stoned, and stabbed Grossman.[90][87] There are also no gas stations with Hebrew lettering on the Temple Mount.[87][88][89][91]
The episode is often cited by those who accuse the media of having an anti-Israel bias, and was the impetus for the founding of [[HonestReporting]].[91][92][93][94] After a letter from Grossman's father noted the error, the AP, the New York Times, and other papers published corrections; despite these corrections, the photograph continues to be used by critics of Israel as a symbol of Israeli aggression and violence.[87][89][91][95]
During the [[2021 Israel–Palestine crisis]], the Israeli army [[Destruction of al-Jalaa Building]], a building housing the AP's Gaza offices and [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] offices.
Israel stated that the building housed [[Hamas]] military intelligence and had given advanced warning of the strike, and no civilians were harmed.[96][97] AP CEO Gary Pruitt released a statement on May 16, stating that he "had no indication Hamas was in the building" and called on the Israeli government to provide the evidence.
On May 17, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Antony Blinken]] said he had not seen any evidence that Hamas operated from the building housing the AP and Al Jazeera, but it is the job of others to handle intelligence matters.
Israel reportedly shared intelligence with American officials and U.S. president [[Joe Biden]] showing Hamas offices inside the building.[99]
[[Reporters Without Borders]] asked the [[International Criminal Court]] to investigate the bombing as a possible [[War crime]].[100]
On June 8, the Israeli ambassador to the US, [[Gilad Erdan]], met with AP CEO Gary Pruitt and vice president for foreign news, Ian Phillips, to discuss the operation.
The announcement came after some AP journalists signed a letter expressing concern over the termination of former news associate Emily Wilder, whom the AP said committed multiple violations of the company's [[Social media policy]].
In May 2024, Israeli officials seized equipment broadcasting a live stream of Northern Gaza from the town of [[Sderot]] as part of a ban on [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] in Israel which had received footage from the broadcast.
In a press briefing, the spokesperson for the [[United States National Security Council]] commented on the seizure, saying "The White House and the State Department immediately engaged with the government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action."[104] Later that day, Israeli Communication Minister [[Shlomo Karhi]] announced via Twitter that the equipment would be returned to the AP and the Israeli Government would review the positioning of the AP broadcast to determine if it posed a security risk.[105]
In 1994, [[Tina Susman]] was on her fourth trip to [[Somalia]], reporting for the AP.
She was reporting on U.S. [[Peacekeeping]] troops leaving the country.
Somali rebels outnumbered her bodyguards in [[Mogadishu]],[106] dragged her from her car in broad daylight,[107] and held her for 20 days.
She told [[Quill (magazine)]] that she believes being a woman was an advantage in her experience there.[108] The AP had requested news organizations including The New York Times, the [[Chicago Tribune]], and [[The Washington Post]] to suppress the story to discourage the emboldening of the kidnappers.[107][109]
In September 2002, [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau reporter Christopher Newton, an AP reporter since 1994, was fired after he was accused of fabricating sources since 2000, including at least 40 people and organizations.
Prior to his firing, Newton had been focused on writing about federal law-enforcement while based at the [[United States Department of Justice]].
In 2007, an [[FBI]] agent working in Seattle impersonated an AP journalist and infected the computer of a 15-year-old suspect with a malicious surveillance software.[111][112] The incident sparked a strongly worded statement from the AP demanding the bureau never impersonate a member of the news media again.[113] In September 2016 the incident resulted in a report by the Justice Department, which the AP said "effectively condone[d] the FBI's impersonation".[114][115] In December 2017, following a US court appearance, a judge ruled in favor of the AP in a lawsuit against the FBI for fraudulently impersonating a member of the news media in conjunction with the 2007 case.[116][117]
In June 2008, the AP sent numerous [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] take-down demands and threatened legal action against several [[Blog]].
The AP contended that the internet blogs were violating the AP's [[Copyright]] by linking to AP material and using headlines and short summaries in those links.
Many bloggers and experts noted that the use of the AP news fell squarely under commonly accepted internet practices and within [[Fair use]] standards.[118] Others noted and demonstrated that the AP routinely takes similar excerpts from other sources, often without attribution or licenses.
In March 2009, the AP counter-sued artist [[Shepard Fairey]] over [[Obama HOPE poster]], saying the uncredited, uncompensated use of an AP photo violated [[Copyright law of the United States]] and signaled a threat to [[Journalism]].
The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by [[Mannie Garcia]], was a popular image during the [[2008 United States presidential election]] and now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)]] in Washington, D.C. According to the AP's lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly "misappropriated The AP's rights in that image".
Fairey said he looked forward to "upholding the [[Freedom of speech]] rights at stake here" and disproving the AP's accusations.[120] In January 2011, the suit was settled with neither side declaring their position to be wrong but agreeing to share reproduction rights and profits from Fairey's work.[121]
In January 2008, the AP sued competitor [[All Headline News]] (AHN) claiming that AHN allegedly infringed on its copyrights and a contentious "quasi-property" right to facts.[122][123] The AP complaint asserted that AHN reporters had copied facts from AP news reports without permission and without paying a syndication fee.
On April 23, 2013, [[Syrian Electronic Army]] posted a tweet to AP's [[Twitter]] account about fictional attacks on the [[White House]], falsely claiming that President [[Barack Obama]] had been injured.[126] The hoax caused a [[Flash crash]] on the American stock markets, with the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] briefly falling by 143 points.[127]
On May 13, 2013, the AP announced that telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012 had been [[Subpoenaed]] by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] and described these acts as a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into news-gathering operations.[128][129] The AP reported that the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but sources stated that the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]]'s office was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012 AP story about a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operation that prevented a terrorist plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight.[130] The DOJ did not direct subpoenas to the AP, instead going to their phone providers, including [[Verizon Wireless]].[131] [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] testified under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee that he recused himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.
On January 10, 2022, AP announced it would start selling [[Non-fungible token]] (NFTs) of their photographs in partnership with a company named Xooa, with the proceeds being used to fund their operations.[133] One of the NFTs they promoted on Twitter on 24 February was an aerial shot depicting an overcrowded migrant boat in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].
The AP has earned 59 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], including 36 for photography, since the award was established in 1917.[136] In May 2020, [[Dar Yasin]], [[Mukhtar Khan]], and [[Channi Anand]] of the AP were honored with the 2020 [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography]].[137] The choice caused controversy,[138][139][140] because it was taken by some as questioning "India's legitimacy over Kashmir" as it had used the word "independence" in regard to [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir]].[141]
The AP won an Oscar[142] in 2024 for the documentary film [[20 Days in Mariupol]], a first-person account[143] of the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
