Loeb]] and [[Angelo Mozilo]].
Loeb died in 2003.[3] The [[Initial public offering]] was less than successful, with company stock trading [[Over-the-counter (finance)]] at less than $1 per share.
In 1985 Countrywide stock was re-listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol CFC.
Between 1982 and 2003, Countrywide delivered investors a 23,000.0% return, exceeding the returns of [[Washington Mutual]], [[Walmart]], and [[Warren Buffett]]'s [[Berkshire Hathaway]].[4]
In 1997, Countrywide spun off Countrywide Mortgage Investment as an independent company called [[IndyMac Bank]].[5] Federal regulators seized IndyMac on July 11, 2008, after a week-long [[Bank run]].[6][7][8]
Nearly all the mortgage loans the company produces in this segment are sold into the [[Secondary market]], mainly in mortgage-backed securities.
In  2006, 45% of those mortgages were conventional [[Non-conforming loan]], loans too large to sell to [[Fannie Mae]].[3]
The company generally performs the ongoing servicing functions related to the mortgage loans that it produces.
It also provides various loan closing services, such as [[Title (property)]], [[Escrow]], and [[Real estate appraisal]].
The Mortgage Banking segment comprises three distinct sectors: Loan Production, [[Loan servicing]], and Loan Closing Services.
[[Loan servicing]] typically retains a fraction of the payment made (normally 25 – 75 basis points of the unpaid principal balance) as a "servicing fee".
LandSafe and its subsidiaries offer loan closing services, including [[Real estate appraisal]] services, automated credit reporting products, flood determination services, and residential [[Title (property)]] services for the six major counties of Southern California.
The Banking segment consisted of Countrywide Bank, [[Federal Savings Bank]], and Countrywide Warehouse Lending.
This nationally chartered bank was regulated jointly by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and the [[Federal Reserve]].
Still, it converted its charter to a federally chartered thrift that is regulated by the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]].[9][10] Countrywide Bank is the 3rd largest Savings and Loan institution and is the fastest-growing bank in United States history.
In addition, the Bank obtains retail deposits, primarily [[Certificate of deposit]], through the Internet, call centers, and more than 200 financial centers, many of which were located in Countrywide Home Loans' retail branch offices as of April 1, 2007.
The Capital Markets segment primarily operates as a registered securities broker-dealer, a residential mortgage loan manager, and a [[Commercial mortgage]] loan originator.
Except its commercial mortgage activities, the company transacts only with [[Institutional customers]], such as banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, asset managers, mutual funds, pension plans, other broker-dealers and governmental agencies.
These are typically delinquent or otherwise illiquid residential mortgage loans, which have primarily originated under [[Federal Housing Administration]] and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] programs.
[[Securities trading]] activities include trading debt securities in the secondary market after the original issuance of the security.
[[Underwriting]] activities encompass the assumption of the risk of buying a new issue of securities from the issuer and reselling the securities to investors, either directly or through dealers.
The Insurance segment activities include offering property, casualty, life, and credit [[Insurance]] as an [[Underwriter]] and as an insurance agency and providing [[Reinsurance]] coverage to primary mortgage insurers through two business units: Balboa Life and Casualty Operations, and Balboa Reinsurance Company.
Balboa Life and Casualty Group underwrite property, casualty, life, and [[Payment protection insurance]] in all 50 states.
Its products include Lender-Placed Property and Auto, which includes lender-placed auto insurance and lender-placed, real-property [[Hazard insurance]]; Voluntary Homeowners and Auto, which underwrites retail homeowners insurance and home warranty plans for consumers; and Life and Credit, which underwrites term life, credit life, and credit [[Disability insurance]] products.
Balboa Reinsurance Company provides a mezzanine layer of [[Reinsurance]] coverage for losses between minimum and maximum specified amounts to the insurance companies that provide [[Private Mortgage Insurance]] on loans in its servicing portfolio.
By 2005, GHL operation processed more than £11.3 billion ($20.3 billion) in loans, all of which are subserviced for [[Barclays plc]], [[Public limited company]], the joint venture partner.
Countrywide maintains a policy of not filing the legally required [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[Form 1099]] to independent brokers.[3] The validity of this is questionable however.
Countrywide agreed to a settlement with New York state attorney general [[Eliot Spitzer]] to compensate black and Hispanic borrowers improperly steered by Countrywide salespeople to higher-cost loans.
Some customers have complained that after the devastating hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Hurricane Gustav]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], Countrywide told loan customers in the affected areas that they could take a break on payments without any late fees, and the payments would be added back to the end of the loan.
In June 2008 [[Conde Nast Portfolio]] reported that numerous Washington D.C. politicians over recent years had received mortgage financing at noncompetitive rates because the corporation considered the officeholders "FOA's" — "Friends of Angelo" (Countrywide Chief Executive [[Angelo Mozilo]]).
The politicians extended such favorable financing included the  chairman of the [[Senate Banking Committee]], [[Christopher Dodd]], and the chairman of the [[Senate Budget Committee]], [[Kent Conrad]].
The article also noted Countrywide's [[Political action committee]] had made large donations to Dodd's campaign.[15]
Senator Dodd proposed that the federal government buy up to $400 billion in defaulted mortgages.[16] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ([[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]]) has called for House and Senate to investigate Senators Conrad and Dodd.[17]
Johnson (businessman)]], former CEO of Fannie Mae and an adviser to presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]], had received loans under the "Friends of Angelo".[18]
Johnson announced he would step down from the vice-presidential vetting position on June 11, 2008, in order to avoid being a distraction to Obama's campaign.
In June 2008 [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that [[Franklin Raines]], a former CEO of Fannie Mae, received below market rates loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation also considered him an "FOA".
He received  loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae.[19]
On July 16, 2008, [[The Washington Post]] reported that Franklin Raines had "taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters."[20] Subsequent attempts to connect Obama's campaign with Franklin Raines were characterized by The Washington Post as "a stretch".[21]
The office of [[Attorney General of Illinois]], [[Lisa Madigan]], filed a [[Civil lawsuit]] in [[Cook County, Illinois]] [[Circuit Court]] against Countrywide Financial Corporation on June 25, 2008.
California Attorney General, [[Jerry Brown]], followed suit by filing a similar lawsuit on June 25, 2008, accusing the lender of breaking the state's laws against [[False advertising]] and unfair business practices.
The lawsuit also claims the defendant mislead many consumers by misinforming them about the workings of certain mortgages such adjustable-rate mortgages, [[Interest-only loan]], low-documentation loans and home-equity loans while telling borrowers they would be able to [[Refinance]] before the interest rate on their loans adjusted.[24]
In August 2008, [[Connecticut]] Attorney General [[Richard Blumenthal]] also brought suit against Countrywide, alleging that deceptive lending practices had ripped off Connecticut homeowners.[1] [permanent dead link]
When Countrywide finances mortgage loans, they usually packaged them for sale to large investors as [[Mortgage-backed security]].
[[Fannie Mae]] or [[Freddie Mac]] can only buy loans which conform to the standards of [[Government-sponsored enterprise]].
After the collapse of [[American Home Mortgage]] on August 6, 2007, attention returned to Countrywide Financial which at the time had issued about 17% of all mortgages in the United States.
Only days later, Countrywide Financial disclosed to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) that these disruptions in the secondary mortgage markets could hurt it financially:
Fitch, Moody's and [[Standard & Poor's]] credit ratings agencies downgraded Countrywide 1 or 2 grades, some to near junk status.
This also limited its access to [[Commercial paper]].
Countrywide also announced its intent to draw on the entire $11.5 billion credit line from a group of 40 banks including [[JPMorgan Chase]].[33]
On Friday August 17, many depositors sought to withdraw their bank accounts.[34]
Countrywide also planned to make 90% of its loans conforming.[35]
By this point stock shares had lost about 75% of their peak value and speculation of bankruptcy broadened.[36][37][38]
At the same time the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] lowered the discount rate 0.5% in a last-minute, early morning conference call.
The Fed accepted about $17.2 billion in [[Repurchase agreement]] for mortgage backed securities to aid in liquidity.
The Fed agreed to exempt both banks from rules that limited the amount that federally insured banks can lend to related brokerage companies to 10% of bank capital.[41] Until then, banking regulation was that banks with federally insured deposits should not be put at risk by brokerage subsidiaries' activities.[42]  On August 23, Citibank and Bank of America said that they and two other banks accessed $500 million in 30-day financing at the Fed's [[Discount window]].
On November 26, 2007, Countrywide stock was hammered on the NYSE, dropping over 10% to a level of $8.64/share; less than half the share's value in August when the firm faced bankruptcy rumors
and a fraction of its value in 2006.[45] One proximate cause was reports that the Atlanta [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] had extended a large amount of its credit to Countrywide to offset its inability to raise funds in the private market.
Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] called for an investigation as to the prudence of the FHLBB's action in this regard.[46]
From 2005 to 2007, [[Angelo Mozilo]] sold much of his CFC stock realizing $291.5 million in profits.[3][47] A class action suit was filed on behalf of shareholders alleging securities violations.
The endgame in [[Bank of America]]'s $4 billion takeover of Countrywide Financial began with a December phone call from Countrywide Chief Executive [[Angelo Mozilo]] to his Bank of America counterpart, Kenneth D.
And on January 11, 2008, [[Bank of America]] announced it had agreed to buy Countrywide for $4 billion in an all-stock transaction.[50] The stock's value settled at about $5½ per share following the announcement; it had been as low as $4.43 before the Bank of America deal was announced.
After four weeks analyzing Countrywide's legal and financial predicament, and modeling how its loan portfolio was likely to perform, Bank of America offered an all-stock deal valued at $4 billion for Countrywide—a fraction of the company's $24 billion market value a year ago.[53] Countrywide [[Shareholders]] approved the deal on June 25, 2008,[54] and it closed July 2, 2008.[55] Bank of America announced on June 26, 2008, that the takeover of Countrywide Financial Corp.
On June 4, 2009, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] charged former CEO [[Angelo Mozilo]] with [[Insider trading]] and [[Securities fraud]], and former COO David Sambol and former CFO Eric Sieracki with securities fraud for failing to disclose Countrywide's lax lending standards in Countrywide's 2006 annual report.[59][60] Despite these charges, Countrywide, and then its successor Bank of America, were awarded the Property Management contract with the Veterans Administration.
