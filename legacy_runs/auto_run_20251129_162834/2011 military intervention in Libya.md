[[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi]] 1,000 military targets destroyed
On 19 March 2011, a [[NATO]]-led coalition began a military intervention into the ongoing [[Libyan civil war (2011)]] to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] (UNSCR 1973).
The [[UN Security Council]] passed the resolution with ten votes in favour and five abstentions, with the stated intent to have "an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute 'crimes against humanity' ...
[imposing] a ban on all flights in the country's airspace — a [[No-fly zone]] — and tightened sanctions on [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s government and its supporters."[21]
Italy only joined the coalition on the condition that NATO took on overall leadership of the mission instead of individual countries.[27] NATO took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named [[Operation Unified Protector]].
On the intervention's first day on 19 March, American and British naval forces fired over 110 [[Tomahawk cruise missile]], and imposed a naval [[Blockade]].[33] The [[French Air Force]], British [[Royal Air Force]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]][34] also undertook [[Sorties]] across Libya.[35][36][37] The intervention did not employ foreign [[Infantry]], with the exception of special forces, which were not covered by the UN resolution.[38][39] NATO flew 26,500 sorties over eight months, including 7,000 bombing sorties targeting Gaddafi's forces.[40]
The Libyan government's response to the campaign was ineffectual, with Gaddafi's forces failing to shoot down any NATO aircraft, despite the country extensively possessing [[Anti-aircraft warfare]].[10][41] The conflict ended in late October following the [[Killing of Muammar Gaddafi]] and the overthrow of his government.
Libya's [[National Transitional Council]] requested that NATO's mission be extended to the end of 2011,[42] however the Security Council [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2016]] on 31 October.[43] NATO's rationale for the intervention faced criticism, notably in a report released by the British parliament in 2016, which concluded that the UK government "failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a significant Islamist element."[44][45][46]
The official names for the interventions by the coalition members were [[Opération Harmattan]] by France; [[Operation Ellamy]] by the United Kingdom; [[Operation Mobile]] for the Canadian participation and [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] for the United States.[47] The operation has also been referred to as the Third Barbary War, in reference to two [[Barbary Wars]].[48][49]
Both Libyan officials[50][51][52][53] and international states[54][55][56][57][58] and organizations[21][59][60][61][62][63][64] called for a no-fly zone over Libya in light of allegations that Gaddafi's military had conducted airstrikes against Libyan rebels in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]].
Initial [[NATO]] planning for a possible no-fly zone took place in late February and early March,[93] especially by NATO members France and the United Kingdom.[94] France and the UK were early supporters of a no-fly zone and had sufficient airpower to impose a no-fly zone over the rebel-held areas, although they might need additional assistance for a more extensive exclusion zone.
At a [[Congressional hearing]], United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] explained that "a no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defences … and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down.
In charge politically was a committee, led by NATO, that included all states participating in enforcing the no-fly zone, while NATO alone was responsible for military action.[97] Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General [[Charles Bouchard]] has been appointed to command the NATO military mission.[98]
After the [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi]] on 20 October 2011, it was announced that the NATO mission would end on 31 October.[99]
In a March 2011 [[Gallup (company)]] poll, 47% of Americans had approved of military action against Libya, compared with 37% disapproval.[228]
On 9 August, the head of [[UNESCO]], [[Irina Bokova]] deplored a NATO strike on Libyan State TV, [[Aljamahiriya TV]], that killed 3 journalists and wounded others.[233] Bokova declared that media outlets should not be the target of military activities.
On 11 August, after the NATO airstrike on Majer (on 9 August) that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called on all sides to do as much as possible to avoid killing innocent people.[234]
The military intervention in Libya has been cited by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] as an example of the [[Responsibility to protect]] policy adopted by the UN at the [[2005 World Summit]].[237] According to [[Gareth Evans (politician)]], "[t]he international military intervention (SMH) in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or Muammar Gaddafi's head.
Legally, morally, politically, and militarily it has only one justification: protecting the country's people."[237] However, the council also noted that the policy had been used only in Libya, and not in countries such as [[Côte d'Ivoire]], undergoing a [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]] at the time, or in response to [[Protests in Yemen]].[237] A CFR expert, Stewert Patrick, said that "There is bound to be selectivity and inconsistency in the application of the responsibility to protect norm given the complexity of national interests at stake in...the calculations of other major powers involved in these situations."[237] In January 2012, the [[Arab Organization for Human Rights]], [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]] and the International Legal Assistance Consortium published a report describing alleged human rights violations and accusing NATO of war crimes.[238]
On 3 June 2011, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed a resolution, calling for a withdrawal of the United States military from the air and naval operations in and around Libya.
It demanded that the administration provide, within 14 days, an explanation of why President [[Barack Obama]] did not come to Congress for permission to continue to take part in the mission.[239]
On 13 June, the House passed a resolution prohibiting the use of funds for operations in the conflict, with 110 Democrats and 138 Republicans voting in favor.[240][241] [[Harold Koh]], the State department's legal advisor, was called to testify in front of the [[Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] to defend the actions of the Obama administration under the [[War Powers Resolution]].[242] Koh was questioned by the Committee on the Obama administration's interpretation of the word "hostilities" under the War Powers Resolution § 4(a)(1) and 5(b).[242] Koh reasoned that under the constitution, the term "hostilities" was left up for interpretation by the executive branch, and therefore the interpretation fit the historical definition of that word.
An in-depth investigation into the Libyan intervention and its aftermath was conducted by the UK Parliament's [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]' cross-party Foreign Affairs Committee, the final conclusions of which were released on 14 September 2016 in a report titled Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK's future policy options.
The [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] saw no evidence that the UK Government carried out a proper analysis of the nature of the rebellion in Libya and it "selectively took elements of Muammar Gaddafi's rhetoric at face value; and it failed to identify the militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion.
[[Alison Pargeter]], a freelance Middle East and North Africa ([[MENA]]) analyst, told the Committee that when Gaddafi's forces re-took Ajdabiya they did not attack civilians, and this had taken place in February 2011, shortly before the NATO intervention.[248] She also said that Gaddafi's approach towards the rebels had been one of "appeasement", with the release of Islamist prisoners and promises of significant development assistance for Benghazi.[248][non-primary source needed] However, evidence which was collected during the intervention suggested otherwise, showing things such as shooting deaths of hundreds of protestors, reports of mass rapes by Libyan Armed Forces and orders from Gaddafi's senior generals to bombard and starve the people of [[Misrata]].[249][250][251][unreliable source?]
In his March 28 address, Barack Obama warned of an imminent risk of a massacre in [[Benghazi]].[252] However, journalist S.Awan argued that the subsequent airstrikes "destroyed a very small convoy of government vehicles, including ambulances."[253] Furthermore, Professor Alan J.
Kuperman argued against the idea of an imminent massacre in Benghazi, arguing that in captured cities such as [[Zawiya, Libya]], [[Misurata]] and [[Ajdabiya]] no massacre had occurred, so Kuperman believed that there was little reason to think Benghazi would be any different.[253] While there were civilian casualties, he argued that there was no effort to target civilian concentrations, with Libya's air force primarily targeting rebel positions.[254]
In a briefing to Hillary Clinton on 2 April 2011, her adviser [[Sidney Blumenthal]] reported that, according to high-level French intelligence, France's motives for overthrowing Gaddafi were to increase France's share of Libya's oil production, strengthen French influence in Africa, and improve President Sarkozy's standing at home.[255] The report also highlighted how Islamic extremists had a large influence on the uprising, which was largely ignored by the West to the future detriment of Libya.[245][46]
The American [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] opposed the U.S. military intervention.[256] Former [[Green Party (United States)]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] branded President Obama as a "war criminal"[257] and called for his [[Impeachment]].[258]
Some critics of Western military intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real impetus for the intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe.[259][260][261] [[Gaddafi's Libya]], despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly in the form of [[Oil reserves]] and [[Financial capital]].[262][better source needed]
The intervention prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including: [[Iran]]'s [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] (who said he supported the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)]] but not Western intervention[261]), Venezuelan [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]] (who referred to Gaddafi as a "[[Martyr]]"[260]), South African President [[Jacob Zuma]],[264][failed verification] and [[List of Presidents of Zimbabwe]] of [[Zimbabwe]] [[Robert Mugabe]] (who referred to the Western nations as "vampires"[259]), as well as the governments of [[Raúl Castro]] in [[Cuba]],[265] [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua,[266] [[Kim Jong-il]] in North Korea,[267] [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] in Namibia,[268] [[Alexander Lukashenko]] in Belarus,[269][270][271] and others.
Gaddafi himself referred to the intervention as a "colonial [[Crusade]] … capable of unleashing a full-scale war",[272] a sentiment that was echoed by Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]: "[[[UNSC Resolution 1973]]] is defective and flawed...It allows everything.
It resembles medieval calls for crusades."[273] President [[Hu Jintao]] of the People's Republic of China said, "Dialogue and other peaceful means are the ultimate solutions to problems," and added, "If military action brings disaster to civilians and causes a humanitarian crisis, then it runs counter to the purpose of the UN resolution."[274] Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] was critical of the intervention as well, rebuking the coalition in a speech at the UN in September 2011.[275] Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], despite the substantial role his country played in the NATO mission, also spoke out against getting involved: "I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country.
Despite its stated opposition to NATO intervention, Russia abstained from voting on [[Resolution 1973]] instead of exercising its veto power as a permanent member of the [[Security Council]]; four other powerful nations also abstained from the vote—[[India]], China, Germany, and [[Brazil]]—but of that group only China has the same veto power.[278]
[[Micah Zenko]] argues that the Obama administration deceived the public by pretending the intervention was intended to protect Libyan civilians instead of achieving regime change when "in truth, the Libyan intervention was about regime change from the very start".[279]
On 22 March 2011, BBC News presented a breakdown of the likely costs to the UK of the mission.[298] Journalist Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis, estimated that flying a [[Tornado GR4]] would cost about [[Pound sterling]]35,000 an hour (c.
Conventional airborne missiles would cost £800,000 each and Tomahawk cruise missiles £750,000 each.[citation needed] Professor Malcolm Charmers of the [[Royal United Services Institute]] similarly suggested that a single cruise missile would cost about £500,000, while a single Tornado sortie would cost about £30,000 in fuel alone.
[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] had said that the MoD estimate of the operation cost was "tens rather than hundreds of millions".[298] On 4 April [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Stephen Dalton]] said that the RAF was planning to continue operations over Libya for at least six months.[299]
Since the end of the war, which overthrew Gaddafi, there has been [[Factional violence in Libya (2011–2014)]] and the new state security forces.[303][304] The violence has escalated into the [[Second Libyan Civil War]].
Critics described the military intervention as "disastrous" and accused it of destabilizing North Africa, leading to the rise of Islamic extremist groups in the region.[305][44] Libya became what many scholars described as a [[Failed state]] — a state that has disintegrated to a point where the government no longer performs its function properly.[306][307][308]
Libya has become the main exit for [[European migrant crisis]].[309] In September 2015, [[South Africa]] President [[Jacob Zuma]] said that "consistent and systematic bombing by NATO forces undermined the security and caused conflicts that are continuing in Libya and neighbouring countries ...
In a 2016 interview with Fox News, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] stated that the "worst mistake" of his presidency was "probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya."[311][312] Obama also acknowledged there had been issues with following up the conflict planning, commenting in a 2016 interview with [[The Atlantic]] magazine that British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] had allowed himself to be "distracted by a range of other things".[313][314][315]
