Elbasan (/ˌɛlbəˈsɑːn/ EL-bə-SAHN,[2] Albanian: [ɛlbaˈsan]; [[Albanian language]] [[Definiteness]]: Elbasani, pronounced [ɛlbaˈsani]) is the [[List of cities and towns in Albania]] of [[Albania]] and seat of [[Elbasan County]] and Elbasan Municipality.
It lies to the north of the river [[Shkumbin]] between the [[Skanderbeg Mountains]] and the [[Myzeqe]] in central Albania.
The name (in the form Elbasan also in [[Aromanian language]])[3] is derived from the [[Ottoman Turkish]] il-basan ("the fortress").[4]
In August 2010 archaeologists discovered two [[Illyrians]] graves near the walls of the castle of Elbasan.[5]
In the second century BC, a [[Ancient Rome]] trading post recorded in [[Latin]] as [[Mansio]] Scampa (also in [[Ancient Greek language]]: Σκάμπα) near the site of modern Elbasan developed close to a junction of two branches of an important Roman road, the [[Via Egnatia]], which connected the [[Adriatic]] coast with [[Byzantium]].
It was one of the most important routes of the [[Roman Empire]].
By the third or fourth century AD, this place had grown into a real city protected by a substantial Roman fortress with towers; the fort covered around 300 square meters.[6] This city appears on late antique itineraries like the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] and [[Itinerarium Burdigalense]] as Scampis or Hiscampis.[7]
It took part in the spread of [[Christianity]] along the Via, and had a bishop, cathedral and basilicas as early as the fifth century.
As a town in a wide river valley it was vulnerable to attacks once the legions were withdrawn but [[Emperor Justinian]] made an effort to improve the fortifications.
The city survived attacks by the [[Bulgars]] and [[Ostrogoths]] and was mentioned in the work of [[Procopius of Cæsarea]].
The site seems to have been abandoned until the [[Ottoman army]] built a military camp there, followed by urban reconstruction under [[Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] in 1466.
The name Elbasan is thought to mean 'the flat fortress' in Albanian or 'the flat province' in Turkish.[8] He had built the castle in order to fight [[Skanderbeg]], due to an [[League of Lezhë]] between the Ottomans and Albanians.[9]
It became the seat of [[Sanjak of Elbasan]], a centre of Ottoman urban civilisation over the next 445 years.
Although [[Halil Inalcik]] explains that the Sanjak of Elbasan was established as soon as the [[Elbasan Castle]] was constructed in 1466, based on [[Tursun Beg]]'s records there is a possibility that Elbasan initially was part of the [[Sanjak of Ohrid]].[10] In 1467 many Christians from [[Skopje]], Ohrid, [[Serres]] and [[Kastoria]] were forcibly deported to Elbasan.[11] In the late 17th century, the Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] passed through Elbasan and noted that "all the inhabitants speak Albanian" having knowledge of Turkish with Muslim clergy being literate in Persian, while merchants also used the Greek and "[[Franks#Legacy]]" languages.[12]
The fortress was dismantled by [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]] in 1832.In 1864, the [[Sanjak of Elbasan]] became a part of [[Monastir Vilayet]].
In the late nineteenth century, Elbasan was inhabited by 3,000 Muslim families and 280 Orthodox Christian families, of which 100 were old Orthodox Albanian families living in the old Christian neighbourhood within the fortress and 180 [[Aromanians]] families residing in the St. Nicholas neighbourhood on the edge of town.[13] At the beginning of the 20th century, it was estimated that 15,000 people lived in Elbasan.[14]
In 1909, after the [[Young Turks]] revolution in [[Istanbul]], an [[Albanian National Congress]] was held in Elbasan to study educational and cultural questions.
The delegates, all from central and southern Albania, endorsed the decision of the [[Congress of Monastir]], which was held in Monastir (modern [[Bitola]], North Macedonia) to use the Latin alphabet rather than the Arabic script in written [[Albanian language]].
Albanians, Turks, Aromunians and [[Sephardic Jews]] were living in Elbasan.
The very first teachers' training college in Albania, the [[Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit]], was established in Elbasan.
During [[First Balkan War]], it was occupied by [[Serbia]] troops on 29 November 1912.
The Muslim majority of Elbasan opposed the installation of [[William, Prince of Albania]] in 1914.
Elbasan was occupied successively by [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Italians]] between 1915 and 1918.
The Bulgarian army occupied Elbasan on January 29, 1916, during [[Bulgarian occupation of Albania]][15] In March 1916 the army of Austria-Hungary took over control of Elbasan.[16] From June 1916 to March 1917 [[Stanislav Kostka Neumann]] fought with the Austrian army there and called his war memoirs about the occupation in Elbasan.[17] Industrial development began in the [[Zog of Albania]] period when tobacco and [[Ethanol]] factories were established.
There was much wartime damage, which was followed by an intensive programme of industrial development in the [[Communist]] period that boosted the city to around 75,000 inhabitants.
The culmination of this process was the construction of the huge Steel of the Party ([[Albanian language]]: Celiku i Partise) [[Metallurgical]] complex outside the city, in the [[Shkumbini]] valley, built with Chinese assistance in the 1970s.
It was emphatically called "The Second National Liberation of Albanian" by [[Enver Hoxha]].
The cost of the complex in environmental impact was high for the Shkumbin valley.[18] [[Elbasan Railway Station]] was opened in 1950.
The renovated [[Elbasan Arena]] became the home stadium of the [[Albania national football team]] and Albania's de facto stadium meeting [[FIFA]]'s criteria.
The city of Elbasan lies to the north of the river [[Shkumbin]] between the [[Skanderbeg Mountains]] and the [[Myzeqe]] in central Albania.
The municipality of Elbasan consists of the administrative units of [[Bradashesh]], [[Funarë]], [[Gjergjan]], [[Gjinar]], [[Gracen]], [[Labinot-Fushë]], [[Labinot-Mal]], [[Papër]], [[Shirgjan]], [[Shushicë, Elbasan]], [[Tregan]], [[Zavalinë]] and Elbasan.[19][20][21] It covers 872.03 km2.[19][22]
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Elbasan has a [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) with an average annual temperature of 13.1 °C (55.6 °F).[23]
Industrial development began during the [[Zog of Albania]] regime with the production of [[Tobacco]] and [[Alcoholic beverage]], and culminated during the [[Communist]] regime.
The city gained prominence after the [[China]] built a [[Steel mill]] in 1974.
The city also hosts a [[Ferrochrome]] [[AlbChrome#Facilities]], which was commissioned in 1989 by the communist regime and now is owned by the [[Balfin Group]].
All these industries caused big [[Pollution]] and Elbasan is considered today to be one of the most polluted cities of Albania.[28]
Elbasan has been occupied by several different groups, including the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Italians]].
Elbasan remained a center of [[Christianity]] in Albania even after the [[Ottoman Empire]] occupation.
After the 1908 [[Congress of Monastir]] (in modern [[Bitola]], North Macedonia) decided to use the [[Latin alphabet]] for the written [[Albanian language]], [[Islam]] clerics influenced by the [[Ottoman Empire]] held various demonstrations in favor of the [[Arabic script]] in Elbasan.
In the center of the city, is located the [[Saint Mary (Elbasan)]] Orthodox Church.
Paintings and frescoes of [[Onufri]], restored by [[David Selenicasi]] and Kostadin Shelcani can still be seen.
Teodor Haxhifilipi, [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], and [[Aleksandër Xhuvani]] have served in the church.
Other orthodox churches in the [[Elbasan District]] include the Mameli church (built in the 17th century), the Saint Nicholas church ([[Albanian language]]: Shen Kolli) in  [[Shelcan]] (built in 1554), the Saint Nicholas church in [[Valesh]] (built in 1604), the [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] church in Sterstan (built in the 18th century), the Saint Michael ([[Albanian language]]: Shen Mehilli) church in [[Shalës]] (built in the 17th century), the Saint Mary church in Dragot (built in the 18th century), the Saint Nicholas church of Elbasan (17th century), and the Elbasan Saint Athanasius church of Elbasan (built in 1554).
About 7 km away from Elbasan is the location of the orthodox [[Saint John Vladimir's Church]] ([[Albanian language]]: Kisha e Shën Gjon Vlladimirit) built by Albanian monarch [[Karl Thopia]] and his son [[Gjergj Thopia]] in 1381.
Notably, Saint [[Jovan Vladimir]] was buried at the church until 1995 when his remains were transferred to the Orthodox Cathedral in Tirana, being brought back to the monastery only for his feast days.[31]
Elbasan is home to the National Autocephalous Albanian Church ([[Albanian language]]: Kisha Autoqefale Kombetare), a relatively new Orthodox Autocephalous church that split from the [[Albanian Orthodox Church]] in 1995.
Elbasan is home to the [[Summer Festival, Albania]] festivities, a [[Pagan]] feast celebrating the end of winter and the coming of [[Summer]].
