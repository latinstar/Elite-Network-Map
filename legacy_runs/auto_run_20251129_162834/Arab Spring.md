The Arab Spring ([[Arabic language]]: الربيع العربي, [[Romanization of Arabic]]: ar-rabīʻ al-ʻarabī) was a series of pro-democracy [[Nonviolent resistance]], [[Rebellion]], and [[Insurgency]] that spread across much of the [[Arab world]] in the early 2010s.
It began [[Tunisian Revolution]] in response to the death of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] by self-immolation.[1][2][3] From Tunisia, the protests initially spread to five other countries: [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], [[Yemen]], [[Syria]] and [[Bahrain]].
Rulers were deposed: [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] of Tunisia, [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of Libya, and [[Hosni Mubarak]] of Egypt, all in 2011; and [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of Yemen in 2012.
[[Omar al-Bashir]] of Sudan was deposed in 2019 after a [[2019 Sudanese coup d'état]] caused by a [[Sudanese revolution]].
[[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria was deposed in December 2024 after 13 years of civil war.
Sustained street demonstrations took place in [[Morocco]], [[Iraq]], [[Algeria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]] and [[Sudan]].
Minor protests took place in [[Djibouti]], [[Mauritania]], [[Palestine]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Western Sahara]].[4] A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is [[Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam]] ([[Arabic language]]: الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام, [[Literal translation]] 'the people want to bring down the regime').[5]
These attacks were answered with violence from protesters in some cases.[9][10][11] Multiple large-scale conflicts followed: the [[Syrian civil war]];[12][13] the rise of [[Islamic State]],[14] [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013)]] and the [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)]];[15] the [[Egyptian Crisis (2011–2014)]], [[2012 Egyptian presidential election]] and [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]] of [[Mohamed Morsi]], and [[Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014)]] and [[Timeline of terrorism in Egypt (2013–present)]];[16] the [[Libyan crisis (2011–present)]];[17] and the [[Yemeni crisis]] and [[Yemeni civil war (2014–present)]].[18] Regimes that lacked major oil wealth and hereditary succession arrangements were more likely to undergo regime change.[19]
While leadership changed and regimes were held accountable, [[Power vacuum]] opened across the Arab world.
Ultimately, it resulted in a contentious battle between a consolidation of power by religious elites and the growing support for democracy in many Muslim-majority states.[20] The early hopes that these popular movements would end corruption, increase political participation, and bring about greater economic equity quickly collapsed in the wake of the [[Counter-revolutionary]] moves by foreign state actors in Yemen,[21] the regional and international military interventions in Bahrain and Yemen, and the destructive civil wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen.[22] Some referred to the succeeding and still ongoing conflicts as the [[Arab Winter]].[12][13][15][16][18]
A new wave of protests began in 2018 which led to the resignation of prime ministers [[Haider al-Abadi]] of Iraq in 2018 and [[Saad Hariri]] of Lebanon in 2020, and the overthrow of presidents [[Omar al-Bashir]] of Sudan and [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] of Algeria in 2019.
Sometimes called the [[Second Arab Spring]], these events showed how the conditions that started the Arab Spring have not faded and political movements against [[Authoritarianism]] and exploitation are still ongoing.[23] Continued protest movements in Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria have been seen as a continuation of the Arab Spring.[24][25]
A major shift in the [[Syrian civil war]] occurred in December 2024 when a rebel offensive led to the [[Fall of the Assad regime]], after over a decade of warfare.
In Libya, [[Libyan civil war (2014–2020)]] concluded, with foreign powers intervening.[26][27] In Yemen, [[Yemeni civil war (2014–present)]] continues to affect the country.[28]
The first specific use of the term Arab Spring as used to denote these events may have started with the US political journal [[Foreign Policy]].[29] Political scientist [[Marc Lynch]] described Arab Spring as "a term I may have unintentionally coined in a 6 January 2011 article" for Foreign Policy magazine.[30][31][32] Protestors involved in the events however described their own political actions as "uprising" (intifada), Arab "awakening" (sahwa) and Arab "renaissance" (nahda), using expressions like al-marar al-Arabi (the Arab bitterness), karama (dignity) and thawra (revolution).[2][19][33]
Some authors argue that [[Western world]], scholars and media used the term to minimize people's revolutionary aims and discourse.[21][19][24] [[Joseph Massad]] on [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] said the term was "part of a US strategy of controlling the movement's aims and goals" and directing it towards Western-style [[Liberal democracy]].[29] When Arab Spring protests in some countries were followed by electoral success for [[Islamism]] parties, some American pundits coined the terms Islamist Spring[34] and Islamist Winter.[35]
The terminology follows the Western example of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] referred to as "Spring of Nations" and the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968, in which a Czech student, [[Jan Palach]], set himself on fire as [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] did.
In the aftermath of the [[Iraq War]], it was used by various commentators and bloggers who anticipated a major Arab movement towards [[Democratization]].[36] The term "Arab Spring" is thus contested as it signifies an expectation that the events would replicate the example of democratic revolutions set by the West.[2][19]
The world watched the events of the Arab Spring unfold, "gripped by the narrative of a young generation peacefully rising up against oppressive authoritarianism to secure a more democratic political system and a brighter economic future".[22] The Arab Spring is widely believed to have been instigated by dissatisfaction, particularly of youth and unions, with the rule of local governments, though some have speculated that wide gaps in income levels and pressures caused by the [[Great Recession]] may have had a hand as well.[37] Some activists had taken part in programs sponsored by the US-funded [[National Endowment for Democracy]], but the United States government claimed that they did not initiate the uprisings.[38]
Numerous factors led to the protests, including issues such as reform,[39] [[Human rights]] violations, [[Political corruption]], economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors,[40] such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the entire population.[41][42] Catalysts for the revolts in all [[North Africa]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] included the concentration of wealth in the hands of monarchs in power for decades, insufficient transparency of its redistribution, corruption, and especially the refusal of the youth to accept the status quo.[43]
Some protesters looked to the [[Turkish model]] as an ideal (contested but peaceful elections, fast-growing but liberal economy, secular constitution but [[Islamism]] government).[44][45][46][47] Other analysts blamed the rise in food prices on commodity traders and the [[Corn ethanol]].[48] Yet others have claimed that the context of high rates of unemployment and corrupt political regimes led to dissent movements within the region.[49][50]
In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention focused on the role of social media and digital technologies in allowing citizens within areas affected by "the Arab Uprisings" as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels.[51] The influence of social media on political activism during the Arab Spring has, however, been much debated.[52][53][54] Protests took place both in states with a very high level of Internet usage (such as [[Bahrain]] with 88% of its population online in 2011) and in states with some of the lowest Internet penetration ([[Yemen]] and [[Libya]]).[55]
The use of social media platforms more than doubled in Arab countries during the protests, with the exception of Libya.[56] Some researchers have shown how [[Collective intelligence]], [[Crowd psychology]] in [[Participatory design#In software development]] such as social media, has immense power to support a collective action—such as foment a political change.[57][58] As of 5 April 2011[update], the number of Facebook users in the Arab world surpassed 27.7 million people.[56] Some critics have argued that digital technologies and other forms of communication—videos, cellular phones, blogs, photos, emails, and text messages—have brought about the concept of a "digital democracy" in parts of North Africa affected by the uprisings.[59][60]
Facebook, Twitter, and other major social media played a key role in the movement of Egyptian and Tunisian activists in particular.[55][61] Nine out of ten Egyptians and Tunisians responded to a poll that they used [[Facebook]] to organize protests and spread awareness.[56] This large population of young Egyptian men referred to themselves as "the Facebook generation", exemplifying their escape from their non-modernized past.[62] Furthermore, 28% of Egyptians and 29% of Tunisians from the same poll said that blocking Facebook greatly hindered and/or disrupted communication.
Social media sites were a platform for different movements formed by many frustrated citizens, including the 2008 "[[April 6 Youth Movement]]" organized by Ahmed Mahed, which set out to organize and promote a nationwide labor strike and which inspired the later creation of the "Progressive Youth of Tunisia".[63]
During the Arab Spring, people created [[List of Facebook features]] on Facebook to raise awareness about alleged crimes against humanity, such as [[Police brutality]] in the Egyptian Revolution (see [[Wael Ghonim]] and [[Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed]]).[64] Whether the project of raising awareness was primarily pursued by Arabs themselves or simply advertised by Western social media users is a matter of debate.
Jared Keller, a journalist for [[The Atlantic]], claims that most activists and protesters used Facebook (among other social media) to organize; however, what influenced Iran was "good old-fashioned word of mouth".
A study by [[Zeynep Tufekci]] of the [[University of North Carolina]] and Christopher Wilson of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] concluded that "social media in general, and Facebook in particular, provided new sources of information the regime could not easily control and were crucial in shaping how citizens made individual decisions about participating in protests, the logistics of protest, and the likelihood of success."[66] Marc Lynch of George Washington University said, "while social media boosters envisioned the creation of a new public sphere based on dialogue and mutual respect, the reality is that Islamists and their adversaries retreat to their respective camps, reinforcing each other's prejudices while throwing the occasional rhetorical bomb across the no-man's land that the center has become."[66] Lynch also stated in a Foreign Policy article, "There is something very different about scrolling through pictures and videos of unified, chanting Yemeni or Egyptian crowds demanding democratic change and waking up to a gory image of a headless 6-year-old girl on your Facebook news feed."[67]
In the countries with the lowest Internet penetration and the limited role of social networks, such as [[Yemen]] and [[Libya]], the role of mainstream electronic media devices—cellular phones, emails, and video clips (e.g., [[YouTube]])—was very important to cast the light on the situation in the country and spread the word about the protests in the outside world.[55] In [[Egypt]], in [[Cairo]] particularly, [[Mosque]] were one of the main platforms to coordinate the protest actions and raise awareness to the masses.[68]
[[Tunisia]] experienced a series of conflicts during the three years leading up to the Arab Spring, the [[2008 Tunisian protests]] occurring in the mining area of [[Gafsa]] in 2008, where protests continued for many months.
In [[Egypt]], the labor movement had been strong for years, with more than 3000 labor actions since 2004, and provided an important venue for organizing protests and collective action.[72] One important demonstration was [[2008 Egyptian general strike]] on 6 April 2008 at the state-run textile factories of [[El Mahalla El Kubra]], just outside [[Cairo]].
The idea for this type of demonstration spread throughout the country, promoted by computer-literate working-class youths and their supporters among middle-class college students.[72] A Facebook page, set up to promote the strike, attracted tens of thousands of followers and provided the platform for sustained political action in pursuit of the "long revolution".[42] The government mobilized to break the strike through infiltration and riot police, and while the regime was somewhat successful in forestalling a strike, dissidents formed the "6 April Committee" of youths and labor activists, which became one of the major forces calling for the anti-[[Hosni Mubarak]] demonstration on 25 January in [[Tahrir Square]].[72]
In [[Algeria]], discontent had been building for years over a number of issues.
In February 2008, US Ambassador Robert Ford wrote in a leaked diplomatic cable that [[Algeria]] is "unhappy" with long-standing political alienation; that social discontent persisted throughout the country, with food strikes occurring almost every week; that there were demonstrations every day somewhere in the country; and that the Algerian government was corrupt and fragile.[citation needed] Some claimed that during 2010 there were as many as "9,700 riots and unrests" throughout the country.[73] Many protests focused on issues such as education and health care, while others cited rampant corruption.[74]
In Western Sahara, the [[Gdeim Izik protest camp]] was erected 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southeast of [[Laayoune]] by a group of young [[Sahrawi people]] on 9 October 2010.
Violence against Sahrawis in the aftermath of the protests was cited as a reason for [[2011 Western Saharan protests]] months later, after the start of the Arab Spring.[76]
The catalyst for the escalation of protests was the self-immolation of Tunisian [[Mohamed Bouazizi]].
His death on 4 January 2011[77] brought together various groups dissatisfied with the existing system, including many unemployed persons, political and human rights activists, labor and trade unionists, students, professors, lawyers, and others to begin the [[Tunisian Revolution]].[70]
The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa that commenced in 2010 became known as the "Arab Spring",[78][79][80] and sometimes as the "Arab Spring and Winter",[81] "Arab Awakening",[82][83] or "Arab Uprisings",[84][85] even though not all the participants in the protests were [[Arabs]].
It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in [[Tunisia]] on 18 December 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, following [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s [[Self-immolation]] in protest of police corruption and ill treatment.[86][87] With the success of the protests in Tunisia, a [[Revolutionary wave]] sparked by the [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] struck [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]],[88] then spread to other countries.
The largest, most organized demonstrations often occurred on a "day of rage", usually Friday afternoon prayers.[89][90][91] The protests also triggered similar unrest [[Impact of the Arab Spring]].
Some Islamist groups initially were even reluctant to join in the protests, and the major religious groups in Egypt—[[Salafis]], [[Al-Azhar]], and the [[Coptic Church]]—initially opposed the revolution.
The mufti of Egypt, [[Ali Gomaa]], proclaimed that rising against a lawful ruler—President Mubarak—was haram, not permissible.
And the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s old guard joined in the protests reluctantly only after being pushed by the group's young people.[92]
The Arab Spring caused the "biggest transformation of the Middle East since decolonization".[93] By the end of February 2012, rulers had been forced from power in [[Tunisian Revolution]],[94] [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]],[95] [[Libyan Civil War (2011)]],[96] and [[Yemeni Revolution]];[97] civil uprisings had erupted [[Bahraini uprising of 2011]][98] and [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War]];[99] major protests had broken out [[2010–12 Algerian protests]],[100] [[2011 Iraqi protests]],[101] [[2011–12 Jordanian protests]],[102] [[Kuwaiti protests (2011–12)]],[103] [[2011–2012 Moroccan protests]],[104] [[2011 Omani protests]],[105] and [[2011–2013 Sudanese protests]];[106] and minor protests had occurred [[2011–12 Mauritanian protests]],[107] [[2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests]],[108] [[2011 Djiboutian protests]],[109] [[2011 Western Saharan protests]],[110] and [[2011–12 Palestinian protests]].
Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January 2011 following the [[Tunisian Revolution]] protests.
Egyptian [[President of Egypt]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February 2011 after 18 days of massive protests, ending his 30-year presidency.
The [[Libya]] leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was overthrown on 23 August 2011, after the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) took control of [[Bab al-Azizia]].
He was killed on 20 October 2011 in his hometown of [[Sirte]] after the NTC took control of the city.
Yemeni President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] signed the GCC power-transfer deal in which a presidential election was held, resulting in his successor [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]] formally replacing him as president on 27 February 2012 in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
Weapons and [[Tuareg people]] fighters returning from the Libyan Civil War stoked a simmering [[Northern Mali conflict]] that has been described as 'fallout' from the Arab Spring in [[North Africa]].[111]
[[Sudan]] President [[Omar al-Bashir]] announced that he would not seek reelection in 2015 (he ultimately retracted his announcement and ran anyway),[112] as did [[Iraq]] Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]], whose term was to end in 2014,[113] although there were violent demonstrations demanding his immediate resignation in 2011.[114] Protests in [[Jordan]] also caused the sacking of four successive governments[115][116] by [[Abdullah II of Jordan]].[117] The popular unrest in [[Kuwait]] also resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister [[Nasser Al-Sabah]]'s cabinet.[118]
The geopolitical implications of the protests drew global attention.[119] Some protesters were nominated for the 2011 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].[120] [[Tawakkol Karman]] of Yemen was co-recipient of the [[2011 Nobel Peace Prize]] due to her role organizing peaceful protests.
In December 2011 [[Time (magazine)]] magazine named "The Protester" its "[[Time Person of the Year]]".[121] Spanish photographer [[Samuel Aranda]] won the 2011 [[World Press Photo]] award for his image of a Yemeni woman holding an injured family member, taken during the civil uprising in Yemen on 15 October 2011.[122]

The protests in Bahrain started on [[Day of Rage (Bahrain)]], and were initially aimed at achieving greater [[Political freedom]] and respect for [[Human rights in Bahrain]]; they were not intended to directly threaten the [[King of Bahrain]].[98][212]: 162–3  Lingering frustration among the [[Shia Islam]] majority with being ruled by the Sunni government was a major root cause, but the protests in Tunisia and Egypt are cited as the inspiration for the demonstrations.[98][212]: 65  The protests were largely peaceful until a pre-dawn raid by police on [[Bahrain Bloody Thursday]] to clear protestors from [[Pearl Roundabout]] in [[Manama]], in which police killed four protesters.[212]: 73–4  Following the raid, some protesters began to expand their aims to a call for the end of the monarchy.[213] On 18 February, [[Bahrain Defence Force]] opened fire on protesters when they tried to reenter the roundabout, [[Death of Abdulredha Buhmaid]] one.[212]: 77–8  The following day protesters reoccupied Pearl Roundabout after the government ordered troops and police to withdraw.[212]: 81 [214] Subsequent days saw large demonstrations; on 21 February a pro-government Gathering of National Unity drew tens of thousands,[212]: 86 [215] whilst on 22 February the number of protestors at the Pearl Roundabout peaked at over 150000 after more than 100000 protesters [[March of loyalty to martyrs]] there and were coming under fire from the Bahraini Military which killed around 20 and injured over 100 protestors.[212]: 88  On 14 March, [[Peninsula Shield Force]] (composed mainly of Saudi and UAE troops) were requested by the government and occupied the country.[212]: 132 [216]
[[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] declared a three-month [[State of emergency]] on 15 March and asked the military to reassert its control as clashes spread across the country.[212]: 139 [217] On 16 March, armed soldiers and riot police cleared the protesters' camp in the Pearl Roundabout, in which 3 policemen and 3 protesters were reportedly killed.[212]: 133–4 [218] Later, on 18 March, the government tore down Pearl Roundabout monument.[212]: 150 [219] After the lifting of emergency law on 1 June,[220] several large rallies were staged by the opposition parties.[221] Smaller-scale protests and clashes outside of the capital have continued to occur almost daily.[222][223] On 9 March 2012, over 100000 protested in what the opposition called "the biggest march in our history".[224][225]
The police response has been described as a "brutal" crackdown on peaceful and unarmed protestors, including doctors and bloggers.[226][227][228] The police carried out midnight house raids in [[Shia Islam]] neighbourhoods, beatings at checkpoints, and denial of medical care in a "campaign of intimidation".[229][230][231][232] More than 2,929 people have been arrested,[233][234] and at least five people died due to torture while in police custody.[212]: 287,288  On 23 November 2011, the [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] released its report on its investigation of the events, finding that the government had systematically tortured prisoners and committed other human rights violations.[212]: 415–422  It also rejected the government's claims that the protests were instigated by [[Iran]].[235] Although the report found that systematic torture had stopped,[212]: 417  the Bahraini government has refused entry to several international human rights groups and news organizations, and delayed a visit by a [[Juan E.
Méndez]].[236][237] More than 80 people had [[Casualties of the Bahraini uprising of 2011 and its aftermath]] since the start of the uprising.[238]
Saudi government forces quashed [[2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests]] in the country and assisted Bahraini authorities in suppressing demonstrations there.
[[Jamal Khashoggi]], a Saudi critic, covered the Arab Spring and spoke out against the Saudi government during this time.
Inspired by the uprising in Tunisia and prior to his entry as a central figure in Egyptian politics, potential [[2011 Egyptian presidential election]] [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] warned of a "Tunisia-style explosion" in Egypt.[241]
Beginning around midnight on 28 January, the Egyptian government attempted, somewhat successfully, to eliminate the nation's Internet access,[242] in order to inhibit the protesters' ability to use [[Media activism]] to organize through [[Social media]].[243] Later that day, as tens of thousands protested on the streets of Egypt's major cities, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] dismissed his government, later appointing a new cabinet.
On 10 February, Mubarak ceded all presidential power to Vice President [[Omar Suleiman (politician)]], but soon thereafter announced that he would remain as president until the end of his term.[246] However, protests continued the next day, and Suleiman quickly announced that Mubarak had resigned from the presidency and transferred power to the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]].[247] The military immediately dissolved the [[Parliament of Egypt]], suspended the [[Constitution of Egypt]], and promised to lift the nation's thirty-year "[[Emergency law in Egypt]]".
A civilian, [[Essam Sharaf]], was appointed as [[Prime Minister of Egypt]] on 4 March to widespread approval among Egyptians in [[Tahrir Square]].[248] Violent protests, however, continued through the end of 2011 as many Egyptians expressed concern about the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]]' perceived sluggishness in instituting reforms and their grip on power.[249]
Hosni Mubarak and his former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]] were sentenced to life in prison on the basis of their failure to stop the killings during the first six days of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.[250] His successor, the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islamist [[Mohamed Morsi]], won a [[2012 Egyptian presidential election]] regarded as free and fair by election observers, and was subsequently sworn in before judges at the [[Supreme Constitutional Court (Egypt)]].[251] [[2012–13 Egyptian protests]] against Morsi erupted in Egypt on 22 November 2012.
More [[June 2013 Egyptian protests]] occurred one year into Morsi's presidency in June 2013, and on 3 July 2013, the military [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]], thus removing him from office.[252]
However, a December 2020 report published by PRI's [[The World (radio program)]], a US-based public radio news magazine, suggests otherwise.
The report says that the Egyptian government increased the amount of [[Capital punishment in Egypt]] that it carried out by more than twofold, with the report saying that the government put to death approximately 60 people.
This number, according to the report, included human rights activists of the [[Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights]] (EIPR), who were arrested in November 2020.
Western countries are perceived to have generally overlooked these issues, including the [[United States]], [[France]], and several other European countries.
The founder of the [[Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] believed that even ten years after the Arab Spring, Egypt was at its lowest for human rights.[253]
By 18 February, the opposition controlled most of [[Benghazi]], the country's second-largest city.
By 20 February, protests had spread to the capital [[Tripoli, Libya]], leading to a television address by [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], who warned the protestors that their country could descend into civil war.
Amidst ongoing efforts by demonstrators and rebel forces to wrest control of Tripoli from the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)]], the opposition set up an [[National Transitional Council]] in Benghazi to oppose Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s rule.[255] However, despite initial opposition success, government forces subsequently took back much of the Mediterranean coast.
On 17 March, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] was adopted, authorising a [[No-fly zone]] over Libya, and "all necessary measures" to protect civilians.
Two days later, France, the United States and the United Kingdom [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] with a bombing campaign against pro-Gaddafi forces.
The forces were driven back from the outskirts of Benghazi, and the rebels [[First Gulf of Sidra offensive]], capturing scores of towns across the coast of Libya.
The offensive stalled however, and a counter-offensive by the government retook most of the towns, until a [[Battle of Brega–Ajdabiya road]] was formed between [[Brega]] and [[Ajdabiya]], the former being held by the government and the latter in the hands of the rebels.
After a [[Battle of Misrata (2011)]], a loyalist siege of rebel-held [[Misrata]], the third largest city in Libya, was broken in large part due to coalition air strikes.
The four major fronts of combat were generally considered to be the [[Nafusa Mountains]], the [[Tripolitania]] coast, the [[Gulf of Sirte]],[256] and the southern [[Libyan Desert]].[257]
In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)]] [[Tripoli, Libya]], scattering Gaddafi's government and marking the end of his 42 years of power.
Many institutions of the government, including Gaddafi and several top government officials, regrouped in [[Sirte]], which Gaddafi declared to be Libya's new capital.[258] Others fled to [[Sabha, Libya]], [[Bani Walid]], and remote reaches of the [[Libyan Desert]], or to surrounding countries.[259][260] However, Sabha [[Battle of Sabha]] in late September,[261] Bani Walid was captured after a [[Battle of Bani Walid]] weeks later,[262] and on 20 October, fighters under the aegis of the [[National Transitional Council]] [[Battle of Sirte (2011)]] Sirte, [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi]] in the process.[263] However, after Gaddafi was killed, the [[Libyan Crisis (2011–present)]] continued.
[[Daraa]] was to be the first city to protest against the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region]] government, which has been ruling [[Syria]] since 1963.[266]
Thousands of protesters gathered in [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Al-Hasakah]], [[Daraa]], [[Deir ez-Zor]], and [[Hama]] on 15 March,[267][268] with recently released politician [[Suheir Atassi]] becoming an unofficial spokesperson for the "Syrian revolution".[269] The next day there were reports of approximately 3000 arrests and a few casualties, but there are no official figures on the number of deaths.[270] On 18 April 2011, approximately 100,000 protesters sat in the central Square of Homs calling for the resignation of president [[Bashar al-Assad]].
Protests continued through July 2011, the government responding with harsh security clampdowns and military operations in several districts, especially in the north.[271] On 31 July, Syrian army tanks stormed several cities, including Hama, Deir Ez-Zour, [[Abu Kamal]], and [[Al-Hirak, Syria]] near Daraa.
At least 136 people were killed, the highest death toll in any day since the start of the uprising.[272] On 5 August 2011, an anti-government demonstration took place in Syria called "God is with us", during which the Syrian security forces shot the protesters from inside the ambulances, killing 11 people.[273] The Arab Spring events in Syria subsequently escalated into the [[Syrian civil war]].
The war caused massive political instability and economic hardship in Syria, with the [[Syrian pound]] plunging to new lows.[274]
On 8 December 2024, the [[Assad regime]] collapsed during a [[2024 Syrian opposition offensives]] by [[Syrian opposition]].
The offensive was spearheaded by [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS) and supported mainly by the Turkish-backed [[Syrian National Army]].
As [[Southern Operations Room]] advanced towards [[Damascus]], reports emerged that [[Bashar al-Assad]] fled the capital aboard a plane to Russia, where he joined his family, already in exile, and was granted [[Right of asylum]].[275] Following Assad's departure, opposition forces declared victory on state television.
Concurrently, the [[Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] confirmed Assad's resignation and his departure from Syria.[276][277][278]
Syrian opposition fighters were surprised at how quickly the Syrian government collapsed in the wake of their offensive.[279] Analysts viewed the event as a significant blow to Iran's [[Axis of Resistance]] due to the use of Syria as a waypoint to supply arms and supplies to their ally [[Hezbollah]].[280][281]
Following the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Sidi Bouzid]], a series of increasingly violent street demonstrations through December 2010 ultimately led to the ousting of longtime [[President of Tunisia]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] on 14 January 2011.
The demonstrations were preceded by high unemployment, [[Food]] [[Inflation]], corruption,[282] lack of [[Freedom of speech]] and other forms of [[Political freedom]],[283] and poor [[Habitability]].
Ben Ali fled into exile in [[Saudi Arabia]], ending his 23 years in power.[286]
A [[State of emergency]] was declared and a caretaker coalition government was created following Ben Ali's departure, which included members of Ben Ali's party, the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]] (RCD), as well as opposition figures from other ministries.
The five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately.[287][288] As a result of continued daily protests, on 27 January Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]] reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself, and on 6 February the former ruling party was suspended;[289] later, on 9 March, it was dissolved.[290] Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] became prime minister.
On 23 October 2011 Tunisians voted in the first post-revolution election to elect representatives to a 217-member [[2011 Tunisian Constituent Assembly election]] that would be responsible for the new constitution.[291] The leading Islamist party, [[Ennahda Movement]], won 37% of the vote, and elected 42 women to the Constituent Assembly.[292]
On 26 January 2014 a [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] was adopted.[293] The constitution is seen as progressive, increasing human rights, gender equality, and government duties toward people, laying the groundwork for a new parliamentary system and making Tunisia a decentralized and [[Open government]].[293][294]
On 26 October 2014 Tunisia held its first [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election]] since the 2011 Arab Spring[295] and its [[2014 Tunisian presidential election]] on 23 November 2014,[296] finishing its transition to a democratic state.
These elections were characterized by a decline in Ennahdha's popularity in favor of the secular [[Nidaa Tounes]] party, which became the first party of the country.[297]
In 2011, 133 peaceful political [[Activists]]—including academics and members of a social organization, [[Al Islah (United Arab Emirates)]]—signed a petition calling for democratic reforms.
Submitted to the Emirati monarch rulers, the petition demanded elections, more legislative powers for the [[Federal National Council]] and an independent judiciary.[300]
In 2012, the authorities arrested 94 of the 133 [[Journalists]], government officials, judges, [[Lawyers]], teachers and student activists, who were detained in secret detention facilities.
For a year, until the trial began in March 2013, the 94 prisoners were subjected to [[Forced disappearance]] and [[Torture]].
The case came to be known as "UAE-94", following which [[Freedom of speech]] was further curbed.
For years, these prisoners have been under [[Arbitrary detention]], with some "held in [[Solitary confinement]], and denied their rights".
In July 2021, [[Amnesty International]] called the UAE authorities to immediately release 60 prisoners of the UAE-94 case, who remained detained nine years after their arrest.[302]
Following the 2011 petition, the UAE authorities also arrested five prominent [[Human rights defenders]] and government critics who did not sign the petition.
One of the prominent Emirati activists, [[Ahmed Mansoor]], reported being beaten twice since then.
Demonstrators in the [[South Yemen]] mainly protested against President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]'s support of [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[South Yemen]], the marginalization of the [[Southern Movement]] people and the exploitation of Southern natural resources.[305][306][307] Other parts of the country initially protested against governmental proposals to modify the [[Constitution of Yemen]], unemployment and economic conditions,[308] and corruption,[309] but their demands soon included a call for the resignation of President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]],[309][310] who had been facing internal opposition from his closest advisors since 2009.[311]
A major demonstration of over 16000 protesters took place in [[Sanaa]] on 27 January 2011,[312] and soon thereafter [[Human rights in Yemen]] and politician [[Tawakkol Karman]] called for a "Day of Rage" on 3 February.[313] According to [[Xinhua News Agency]], organizers were calling for a million protesters.[314] In response to the planned protest, Ali Abdullah Saleh stated that he would not seek another [[Elections in Yemen]].[315]
On 3 February, 20000 protesters demonstrated against the government in Sana'a,[316][317] others participated in a "Day of Rage" in Aden[318] that was called for by [[Tawakel Karman]],[313] while soldiers, armed members of the [[General People's Congress (Yemen)]], and many protestors held a pro-government rally in Sana'a.[319] Concurrent with the resignation of Egyptian president Mubarak, Yemenis again took to the streets protesting President Saleh on 11 February, in what has been dubbed a "Friday of Rage".[320] The protests continued in the days following despite clashes with government advocates.[321] In a "Friday of Anger" held on 18 February, tens of thousands of Yemenis took part in anti-government demonstrations in the major cities of Sana'a, [[Taiz]], and [[Aden]].
Protests continued over the following months, especially in the three major cities, and briefly intensified in late May into urban warfare between [[Hashid]] tribesmen and army defectors allied with the opposition on one side and security forces and militias loyal to Saleh on the other.[322]
After Saleh pretended to accept a [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]-brokered plan allowing him to cede power in exchange for immunity from prosecution only to back away before signing three separate times,[323][324] an assassination attempt on 3 June left him and several other high-ranking Yemeni officials injured by a blast in the presidential compound's mosque.[325] Saleh was evacuated to [[Saudi Arabia]] for treatment and handed over power to Vice President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], who largely continued his policies[326] and ordered the arrest of several Yemenis in connection with the attack on the presidential compound.[325] While in Saudi Arabia, Saleh kept hinting that he could return any time and continued to be present in the political sphere through television appearances from [[Riyadh]] starting with an address to the Yemeni people on 7 July.[327] On 13 August, a demonstration was announced in Yemen as "Mansouron Friday" in which hundreds of thousands of Yemenis called for Saleh to go.
Saleh thereby agreed to step down and set the stage for the transfer of power to his vice president.[331] A [[2012 Yemeni presidential election]] was then held on 21 February 2012, in which Hadi (the only candidate) won 99.8% of the vote.[332] Hadi then took the oath of office in Yemen's parliament on 25 February.[333] By 27 February Saleh had resigned from the presidency and transferred power to Hadi.[334] The replacement government was overthrown by Houthi rebels on 22 January 2015, starting the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)]] and the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].
In the aftermath of the Arab Spring in various countries, there was a wave of violence and instability commonly known as the Arab Winter[335] or Islamist Winter.[336] The Arab Winter was characterized by extensive civil wars, general regional instability, economic and demographic decline of the [[Arab League]] and overall religious wars between Sunni and Shia Muslims.
In Tunisia and Egypt, where the existing regimes were ousted and replaced through a process of free and fair election, the revolutions were considered short-term successes.[337][338][339] This interpretation is, however, problematized by the subsequent political turmoil that emerged in Egypt and the autocracy that has formed in [[Tunisia]].
Elsewhere, most notably in the monarchies of [[Morocco]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], existing regimes co-opted the Arab Spring movement and managed to maintain order without significant social change.[340][341] In other countries, particularly Syria and Libya, the apparent result of Arab Spring protests was a complete [[Societal collapse]].[337][failed verification – see discussion]
Putnam]] and [[Joel S.
One of the primary influences that have been highlighted in the analysis of the Arab Spring is the relative strength or weakness of a society's formal and informal [[Institution]] prior to the revolts.
Television coverage by channels like [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] and [[BBC News]] provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the success of the Egyptian Revolution.
In Tunisia, due to tourism coming to a halt and other factors during the revolution and Arab Spring movement, the budget deficit has grown and unemployment has risen since 2011.[351] According to the [[World Bank]] in 2016, "Unemployment remains at 15.3% from 16.7% in 2011, but still well above the pre-revolution level of 13%."[351] Large scale emigration brought on by a long and treacherous civil war has permanently harmed the Syrian economy.
The strength of the middle class is, in turn, directly connected to the existing political, economic, and educational institutions in a country, and the middle class itself may be considered an informal institution.[355] In very broad terms, this may be reframed in terms of development, as measured by various indicators such as the [[Human Development Index]]: [[Rentier state]] such as the oil monarchies of the Persian Gulf exhibited less successful revolutions overall.[356]
Contrary to the common discourse, Hussein Agha and Robert Malley from [[The New Yorker]] argue that the divide in the post–Arab Spring in the Middle East is not sectarianism:
Agha and Malley point out that even in Syria there has been a misrepresentation of the conflict, that the [[Assad regime]] relied on an alliance that included middle class Sunnis along with other religious minorities.
Prior to the uprising, the Syrian regime enjoyed some financial and political support from Sunni [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]].
The "select rich urban bourgeoisie, the Sunni Damascene in particular", according to Tokyo University researcher Housam Darwisheh, "now has a direct interest in preserving stability and their relations with the regime as long as their businesses prosper."[363] In the view of the Arab sociologist [[Halim Barakat]], "the persistence of communal cleavages complicates rather than nullifies social class consciousness and struggles."[364]
The [[2018–2024 Arab protests]] were a series of anti-government protests which began in several [[Arab world]] countries in 2018.[365][366]
In [[Iraq]], the deadliest incident of civil unrest since the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]] resulted in its [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Adil Abdul-Mahdi]] being replaced.[367][368][369]
[[Sudanese Revolution]] in [[Sudan]] resulted in the overthrow of president [[Omar al-Bashir]] in a military [[2019 Sudanese coup d'état]],[370] the [[Khartoum massacre]], and the transfer of power from a military junta to the [[Transitional Sovereignty Council]] but led to a [[Sudanese civil war (2023–present)]] in 2023.
This does not, however, exclude the possibility that revolutions may occur in more pluralistic societies as well."[375] What was prevalent, according to the Syrian writer and political dissident [[Yassin al-Haj Saleh]] was three 'springs' that ensured the status quo.
Two months into the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings, [[The Economist]] magazine in a leader article spoke about a new generation of young people, idealists, "inspired by democracy", which made revolutions.
A social theorist specialising in social movements and social change in the Middle East, [[Asef Bayat]], has provided an analysis based on his decades-long of research as "a participant-observer" (in his own words).
In his appraisal of the Arab revolutions, Bayat discerns a remarkable difference between these revolutions and the revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in countries like Yemen, [[Nicaragua]] and Iran.
[[Wael Ghonim]], an Internet activist who would later gain an international fame, acknowledged that what he had intended by founding a Facebook page was a "simple reaction to the events in Tunisia" and that "there was no master plans or strategies" a priori.[383] That the objective was reform to be achieved through peaceful means and not revolution was explicitly put forward by [[April 6 Movement]], one of the leading forces of the Egyptian uprising, in their statements.
According to Cambridge sociologist Hazem Kandil, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] did not aim at taking power during the events leading up to the toppling of Mubarak.
The biggest and most organised organisation in Egypt in fact negotiated with the regime in "infamous talks between [[Morsi]] and the then vice-president [[Omar Suleiman (politician)]]", and "an informal deal was reached: withdraw your members from Tahrir Square, and we allow you to form a political party." Then the Brotherhood wavered whether to file a presidential candidate and did not push for a new constitution, choosing to work with the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCAF):
George Lawson from the [[London School of Economics]] places the Arab uprisings within the post-Cold War world.
It saw an influx of humanitarian projects, [[NGOs]] and charity work, liberal [[Think tanks]] and emphasis on [[Civil society]] work.
The focus instead shifted to individual freedoms and [[Free market]].
The new idea of [[Civil society]] was different from the kind of civil society [[Antonio Gramsci]], for instance, envisaged: 'a revolution before the revolution'.
When Arab regimes viewed NGOs' leaders and other similar organisations with suspicion, accusing Western governments of providing funding and training to 'illegal organisations' and fomenting revolution, diplomatic cables reported "how American officials frequently assured skeptical governments that the training was aimed at reform, not promoting revolutions".[392] And when the Egyptian uprising was gaining its momentum, the American president [[Barack Obama]] "did not suggest that the 82-year-old leader step aside or transfer power...
Wisner]] publicly suggested that Mr. Mubarak had to be at the center of any change, and Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] warned that any transition would take time."[393] Some activists, who read the American thinker and nonviolence advocate [[Gene Sharp]], obtained training from foreign bodies, including the Serbian opposition movement [[Otpor!]], and April 6 Movement modelled its logo after Otpor's.[393] Otpor, writes Bayat in his discussion of the agencies of the Arab Spring activism in Tunisia and Egypt, obtained funds from well-known American organisations such as the American [[National Endowment for Democracy]], [[USAID]], and the [[International Republican Institute]].
In Algeria under pressure of weeks of protests, the head of the army forced the ailing twenty-year-serving president, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], to abdicate.
In Sudan, after four months of protests, the Sudani defense minister ousted longtime President [[Omar al-Bashir]] in a coup.[395] Writing about what he calls "a rebirth of Tahrir Square", the prominent Lebanese novelist and critic [[Elias Khoury]], averred that "perhaps the secret of the Arab Spring lies not in its victories or defeats, but in its ability to liberate people from fear." Despite the "faded spirit of Tahrir Square" and an outcome that Khoury describes as a "monarchy that abrogates legal standards", a renaissance of resistance is unstoppable:
In its economic and social manifesto, the Tunisian [[Ennahda Movement]] states that the movement "adopts the social and solidarised market economy within a national approach based on free economic activity, freedom of ownership, production and administration on the one hand, and social justice and equal opportunities on the other hand" and that "national capital has to be the axis in the development process."[397] The [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt]] mainly focuses on "reform of existing political systems in the Arab world.
On its part the [[International Centre for Transitional Justice]] has set nine 'concrete and tangible' goals with focus on "accountability for serious violations of human rights, access to justice, facilitating peace processes, advancing the cause of reconciliation and reforming the state and social institutions".[399] One of those goals was taken up by [[Truth and Dignity Commission (Tunisia)]] that recorded and submitted to the relevant court the human rights abuses which had been committed by the Tunisian regime.
Some observers and social analysts remarked, however, that the issue of [[Social justice]] remained a rhetoric or was marginalised.
With the survival of the regime in Egypt and the rolling back of what was gained in the short period after the overthrow of [[Mubarak]], the persistence, or even the worsening, of the socio-economic conditions that led to the Tunisian uprising, a [[Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain]] assisted the defeat of the uprising in the country, and especially the descent of other uprisings into brutal civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen, with acute humanitarian crises, there are:
of [[Tripoli, Libya]] by military leader [[Khalifa Haftar]], for whom U.S. President Donald Trump had voiced his support, the Syrian policy scholar Marwan Kabalan argued in an opinion piece for Al Jazeera that "counter-revolutionary forces are seeking to resurrect the military dictatorship model the Arab Spring dismantled." Kabalan contended that "regional and world powers have sponsored the return of military dictatorships to the region, with the hope that they would clean up the Arab Spring 'mess' and restore order." He also referred to Western powers' history of backing [[Military dictatorship]] in the region, and how American interests in the Middle East clashed with French and British ones.
He cited the U.S.-supported coups in Syria and Egypt, but generally how, as former U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] admitted, the United States "pursued stability at the expense of democracy...
Hellyer]] attributes the persistence of [[Autocracy]] and [[Dictatorship]], as well as counter-revolution, to structures that go back to [[Colonialism]] – and also to the forms that states in the [[MENA]] region took in the postcolonial era and the social pacts established in the process.
Compromise and dialogue with the entrenched regimes, followed by elections in [[Tunisia]] and Egypt, have produced either limited change or counter-revolution.
In the first quarter of 2019, protests and mass mobilisation in Sudan and Algeria succeeded in toppling the heads of state, but, as scholar and [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] fellow [[Marina Ottaway]] states, there is a dilemma: The demands of the genuine grassroots movements are unlikely "to be attained through a peaceful process – one without violence and the violation of the human rights of many." Ottaway points to the experiences of Algeria and Egypt; in the former, the regime annulled the results of the elections in the early 1990s, and in the latter, the military carried out a bloody repression of the Muslim Brotherhood government after the Brotherhood's own short-lived presidency was removed from office:
