The Harare Commonwealth Declaration was a declaration of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], setting out the Commonwealth's core principles and values, detailing the Commonwealth's [[Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria]], and redefining and reinforcing its purpose.
The Declaration was issued in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]], on 20 October 1991, during the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1991]] [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].[1] It reaffirmed the political principles laid out in the [[Singapore Declaration]] of twenty years before, and (along with the Singapore Declaration) is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth's [[Uncodified constitution]],[2] until the adoption of the [[Charter of the Commonwealth]] in 2012.
The Singapore Declaration had committed the Commonwealth to several principles in 1971: [[World peace]] and support for the United Nations; [[Individual liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism]]; opposition to racism; opposition to [[Colonialism]]; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and [[Economic inequality]]; [[Free trade]]; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international [[Coercion]].[3] The Harare Declaration reaffirmed all these except the last.
At Harare, the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] dedicated themselves to applying these principles to then-current issues, such as the end of the [[Cold War]], the near-completion of [[Decolonization]], and the impending end of the [[Apartheid]] government in South Africa.[1] The declaration also charted a course for the Commonwealth to take it into the next century.[4]
Critical to the document is the removal of a reference to the opposition to international [[Coercion]], which had been included in the Singapore Declaration.[5] The implication at Singapore was that not even the Commonwealth itself had any right to enforce its other core values, as they could only be enforced by using coercive powers.[5] This apparent conflict was resolved at Harare, and further clarified by the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], which clearly mandated the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.[5]
