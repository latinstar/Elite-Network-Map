[[South Africa]]
The South African Border War, also known as the Namibian War of Independence, and sometimes denoted in South Africa as the Angolan Bush War, was a largely [[Asymmetric warfare]] that occurred in [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]), [[Zambia]], and [[Angola]] from 26 August 1966 to 21 March 1990.
It was fought between the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) and the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), an armed wing of the [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO).
The South African Border War was closely intertwined with the [[Angolan Civil War]].
Following several years of unsuccessful petitioning through the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Court of Justice]] for Namibian independence from South Africa, SWAPO formed the PLAN in 1962 with material assistance from the [[Soviet Union]], China, and sympathetic African states such as [[Tanzania]], [[Ghana]], and [[Algeria]].[20] Fighting broke out between PLAN and the South African security forces in August 1966.
Between 1975 and 1988, the SADF staged massive conventional raids into Angola and Zambia to eliminate PLAN's [[Forward operating base]].[21] It also deployed specialist counter-insurgency units such as [[Koevoet]] and [[32 Battalion (South Africa)]], trained to carry out external reconnaissance and track guerrilla movements.[22]
South African tactics became increasingly aggressive as the conflict progressed.[21] The SADF's incursions produced Angolan casualties and occasionally resulted in severe collateral damage to economic installations regarded as vital to the Angolan economy.[23] Ostensibly to stop these raids, but also to disrupt the growing alliance between the SADF and the [[UNITA]] (UNITA), which the former was arming with captured PLAN equipment,[24] the Soviet Union backed the [[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) through a large contingent of military advisers,[25] along with up to four billion dollars' worth of modern defence technology in the 1980s.[26] Beginning in 1984, regular Angolan units under Soviet command were confident enough to confront the SADF.[26] Their positions were also [[Cuban intervention in Angola]].[26] The state of war between South Africa and Angola briefly ended with the short-lived [[Lusaka Accords]], but resumed in August 1985 as both PLAN and UNITA took advantage of the ceasefire to intensify their own guerrilla activity, leading to a renewed phase of FAPLA combat operations culminating in the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]].[23] The South African Border War was virtually ended by the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)]], mediated by the United States, which committed to a withdrawal of Cuban and South African military personnel from Angola and South West Africa, respectively.[27][28] PLAN launched its [[Operation Merlyn]] in April 1989.[29] South West Africa received formal independence as the Republic of Namibia a year later, on 21 March 1990.[11]
Despite being largely fought in neighbouring states, the South African Border War had a significant cultural and political impact on South African society.[30] The country's [[Apartheid]] government devoted considerable effort towards presenting the war as part of a [[Containment]] programme against regional Soviet expansionism[31] and used it to stoke public anti-communist sentiment.[32] It remains an integral theme in contemporary South African literature at large and [[Afrikaans]]-language works in particular, having given rise to a unique genre known as grensliteratuur (directly translated "border literature").[23]
Various names have been applied to the undeclared conflict waged by South Africa in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]) from the mid 1960s to the late 1980s.
The term "South African Border War" has typically denoted the military campaign launched by the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), which took the form of sabotage and rural insurgency, as well as the external raids launched by South African troops on suspected PLAN bases inside Angola or Zambia.[32] These occasionally provoked conventional engagements with the [[Zambian Defence Force]] (ZNDF) and the [[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA).[32] The strategic situation was further complicated by the fact that South Africa occupied large swathes of Angola for extended periods in support of the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), making the "Border War" an increasingly inseparable conflict from the parallel [[Angolan Civil War]].[32]
"Border War" entered public discourse in South Africa during the late 1970s; the term was adopted thereafter by the country's ruling [[National Party (South Africa)]].[32] Due to the covert nature of most [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) operations inside Angola, the term was favoured as a means of omitting any reference to engagements on foreign soil.

The [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) has described the South African Border War as the Namibian War of National Liberation[32] and the Namibian Liberation Struggle.[35] In the Namibian context, it is also commonly referred to as the Namibian War of Independence.
Namibia was governed as [[German South West Africa]], a colony of the [[German Empire]], until [[World War I]], when it was invaded and occupied by [[Allies of World War I]] forces under General [[Louis Botha]].
Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], a [[League of Nations mandate]] was imposed by the [[League of Nations]] to govern African and Asian territories held by Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] prior to the war.[36] The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposal put forward by those who wished to grant the territories to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.[36]
All former German and Turkish territories were classified into three types of mandates – Class "A" mandates, predominantly in the Middle East; Class "B" mandates, which encompassed central Africa; and Class "C" mandates, which were reserved for the most sparsely populated or least developed German colonies: South West Africa, [[German New Guinea]], and the Pacific islands.[36]
Nevertheless, the bestowal of a mandate by the League of Nations did not confer full sovereignty, only the responsibility of administering it.[36] In principle, mandating countries were only supposed to hold these former colonies "in trust" for their inhabitants, until they were sufficiently prepared for their own self-determination.[37] Under these terms, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were granted the German Pacific islands, and the [[Union of South Africa]] received South West Africa.[37]
It soon became apparent the South African government had interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation.[37] In September 1922, South African Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]] testified before the League of Nations Mandate Commission that South West Africa was being fully incorporated into the Union and should be regarded, for all practical purposes, as a fifth province of South Africa.[37] According to Smuts, this constituted "annexation in all but in name".[37]
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the League of Nations complained that of all the mandatory powers South Africa was the most delinquent with regards to observing the terms of its mandate.[38] The Mandate Commission vetoed a number of ambitious South African policy decisions, such as proposals to nationalise South West African railways or alter the preexisting borders.[38] Sharp criticism was also leveled at South Africa's disproportionate spending on the local [[White Namibians]], which the former defended as obligatory since white South West Africans were taxed the heaviest.[38] The League adopted the argument that no one segment of any mandate's population was entitled to favourable treatment over another, and the terms under which the mandate had been granted made no provision for special obligation towards whites.[38] It pointed out that there was little evidence of progress being made towards political self-determination.[38] Just prior to [[World War II]], South Africa and the League remained at an impasse over this dispute.[38]
After World War II, Jan Smuts headed the South African delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]].
As a result of this conference, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system.
Article 77 of the [[United Nations Charter]] stated that UN trusteeship "shall apply...to territories now held under mandate"; furthermore, it would "be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms".[39] Smuts was suspicious of the proposed trusteeship, largely because of the vague terminology in Article 77.[38]
Heaton Nicholls, the South African high commissioner in the [[United Kingdom]] and a member of the Smuts delegation to the UN, addressed the newly formed UN [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 17 January 1946.[39] Nicholls stated that the legal uncertainty of South West Africa's situation was retarding development and discouraging foreign investment; however, self-determination for the time being was impossible since the territory was too undeveloped and underpopulated to function as a strong independent state.[39] In the second part of the first session of the General Assembly, the floor was handed to Smuts, who declared that the mandate was essentially a part of the South African territory and people.[39] Smuts informed the General Assembly that it had already been so thoroughly incorporated with South Africa a UN-sanctioned annexation was no more than a necessary formality.[39]
The National Party dismissed the UN as unfit to meddle with South Africa's policies or discuss its administration of the mandate.[38] One National Party speaker, [[Eric Louw]], demanded that South West Africa be annexed unilaterally.[38] During the [[South African general election, 1948]], the National Party was swept into power, newly appointed Prime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] prepared to adopt a more aggressive stance concerning annexation, and Louw was named ambassador to the UN.
During an address in [[Windhoek]], Malan reiterated his party's position that South Africa would annex the mandate before surrendering it to an international trusteeship.[38] The following year a formal statement was issued to the General Assembly which proclaimed that South Africa had no intention of complying with trusteeship, nor was it obligated to release new information or reports pertaining to its administration.[40] Simultaneously, the South West Africa Affairs Administration Act, 1949, was passed by South African parliament.
The UN General Assembly responded by deferring to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which was to issue an advisory opinion on the international status of South West Africa.[38] The ICJ ruled that South West Africa was still being governed as a mandate; hence, South Africa was not legally obligated to surrender it to the UN trusteeship system if it did not recognise the mandate system had lapsed.[40] Conversely, however, it was still bound by the provisions of the original mandate.[40] Adherence to the original mandate meant South Africa could not unilaterally modify the international status of South West Africa.[40] Malan and his government rejected the court's opinion as irrelevant.[38] The UN formed a Committee on South West Africa, which issued its own independent reports regarding the administration and development of that territory.
The Committee's reports became increasingly scathing of South African officials when the National Party imposed its harsh system of racial segregation and stratification—[[Apartheid]]—on South West Africa.[40]
In 1958, the UN established a Good Offices Committee which continued to invite South Africa to bring South West Africa under trusteeship.[40] The Good Offices Committee proposed a partition of the mandate, allowing South Africa to annex the southern portion while either granting independence to the north, including the densely populated [[Ovamboland]] region, or administering it as an international trust territory.[38] The proposal met with overwhelming opposition in the General Assembly; fifty-six nations voted against it.
Mounting internal opposition to apartheid played an instrumental role in the development and militancy of a South West African nationalist movement throughout the mid to late 1950s.[41] The 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]], a series of nonviolent protests launched by the [[African National Congress]] against [[Pass laws]], inspired the formation of South West African student unions also opposed to apartheid.[35] In 1955, their members organised the South West African Progressive Association (SWAPA), chaired by Uatja Kaukuetu, to campaign for South West African independence.
Although SWAPA did not garner widespread support beyond intellectual circles, it was the first nationalist body claiming to support the interests of all black South West Africans, irrespective of tribe or language.[41] SWAPA's activists were predominantly [[Herero people]] students, schoolteachers, and other members of the emerging black [[Intelligentsia]] in Windhoek.[35]
Meanwhile, the [[Ovamboland People's Organization]] (later the Ovamboland People's Organisation, or OPO) was formed by nationalists among partly urbanised migrant [[Ovambo people]] labourers in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.
The OPO's constitution cited the achievement of a UN trusteeship and ultimate South West African independence as its primary goals.[35] A unified movement was proposed that would include the politicisation of Ovambo contract workers from northern South West Africa as well as the Herero students; this resulted in the unification of SWAPA and the OPO as the [[South West African National Union]] (SWANU) on 27 September 1959.[41]
In December 1959, the South African government announced that it would forcibly relocate all residents of [[Old Location]], a black neighbourhood located near Windhoek's city center, in accordance with apartheid legislation.[41] SWANU responded by organising mass demonstrations and a bus boycott on 10 December.
In the ensuing confrontation South African police opened fire, killing eleven protestors.[41] After the Old Location incident, the OPO split from SWANU, citing differences with the organisation's Herero leadership.[41] Because the UN and potential foreign supporters reacted sensitively to any implications of tribalism and had favoured SWANU for its claim to represent the South West African people as a whole, the OPO renamed itself the [[South West African People's Organization]].[41] It later opened its ranks to all South West Africans sympathetic to its aims.[35]
The movement scored a major diplomatic success when it was recognised by [[Tanganyika (1961-1964)]] and allowed to open an office in [[Dar es Salaam]].[41] SWAPO's first manifesto, released in July 1960, was remarkably similar to SWANU's.
Both advocated the abolition of colonialism and all forms of racialism, the promotion of [[Pan-Africanism]], and called for the "economic, social, and cultural advancement" of South West Africans.[35] However, SWAPO went a step further by demanding immediate independence under black majority rule, to be granted at a date no later than 1963.[35] The SWAPO manifesto also promised [[Universal suffrage]], sweeping welfare programmes, free healthcare, free public education, the nationalisation of all major industry, and the forcible redistribution of foreign-owned land "in accordance with African communal ownership principles".[35]
Modelled after [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the armed wing of the African National Congress, the South West African Liberation Army (SWALA) was formed by SWAPO in 1962.[41] The first seven SWALA recruits were sent from Dar es Salaam to [[Egypt]] and the [[Soviet Union]], where they received military instruction.[42] Upon their return, they began training guerrillas at a makeshift camp established for housing South West African refugees in [[Kongwa District]], Tanzania.[42]
The increasing likelihood of armed conflict in South West Africa had strong international foreign policy implications, for both Western Europe and the Soviet bloc.[43] Prior to the late 1950s, South Africa's defence policy had been influenced by international [[Cold War]] politics, including the [[Domino theory]] and fears of a conventional Soviet military threat to the strategic Cape trade route between the south Atlantic and Indian oceans.[44] Noting that the country had become the world's principal source of [[Uranium]], the South African Department of External Affairs reasoned that "on this account alone, therefore, South Africa is bound to be implicated in any war between East and West".[44] Prime Minister Malan took the position that colonial Africa was being directly threatened by the Soviets, or at least by Soviet-backed communist agitation, and this was only likely to increase whatever the result of another European war.[44] Malan promoted an African Pact, similar to NATO, headed by South Africa and the Western colonial powers accordingly.
The concept failed due to international opposition to apartheid and suspicion of South African military overtures in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].[44]
South Africa's participation in the [[Korean War]] produced a significant warming of relations between Malan and the United States, despite American criticism of apartheid.[4] Until the early 1960s, South African strategic and military support was considered an integral component of U.S. foreign policy in Africa's southern subcontinent, and there was a steady flow of defence technology from Washington to Pretoria.[4] American and Western European interest in the defence of Africa from a hypothetical, external communist invasion dissipated after it became clear that the nuclear arms race was making global conventional war increasingly less likely.[44] Emphasis shifted towards preventing communist subversion and infiltration via [[Proxy war]] rather than overt Soviet aggression.[44]
The advent of global [[Decolonisation]] and the subsequent rise in prominence of the Soviet Union among several newly independent African states was viewed with wariness by the South African government.[45] National Party politicians began warning it would be only a matter of time before they were faced with a Soviet-directed insurgency on their borders.[45] Outlying regions in South West Africa, namely the [[Caprivi Strip]], became the focus of massive SADF air and ground training manoeuvres, as well as heightened border patrols.[43] A year before SWAPO made the decision to send its first SWALA recruits abroad for guerrilla training, South Africa established fortified police outposts along the Caprivi Strip for the express purpose of deterring insurgents.[43] When SWALA cadres armed with Soviet weapons and training began to make their appearance in South West Africa, the National Party believed its fears of a local Soviet proxy force had finally been realised.[43]
The Soviet Union took a keen interest in Africa's independence movements and initially hoped that the cultivation of socialist client states on the continent would deny their economic and strategic resources to the West.[46] Soviet training of SWALA was thus not confined to tactical matters but extended to Marxist–Leninist political theory, and the procedures for establishing an effective political-military infrastructure.[47] In addition to training, the Soviets quickly became SWALA's leading supplier of arms and money.[48] Weapons supplied to SWALA between 1962 and 1966 included [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, [[SKS]] carbines, and [[TT pistol]] pistols, which were well-suited to the insurgents' unconventional warfare strategy.[49][50]: 22
Despite its burgeoning relationship with SWAPO, the Soviet Union did not regard Southern Africa as a major strategic priority in the mid 1960s, due to its preoccupation elsewhere on the continent and in the Middle East.[47] Nevertheless, the perception of South Africa as a regional Western ally and a bastion of [[Neocolonialism]] helped fuel Soviet backing for the nationalist movement.[47] Moscow also approved of SWAPO's decision to adopt guerrilla warfare because it was not optimistic about any solution to the South West Africa problem short of revolutionary struggle.[47] This was in marked contrast to Western governments, which opposed the formation of SWALA and turned down the latter's requests for military aid.[51]
In November 1960, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] had formally petitioned the ICJ for a binding judgment, rather than an advisory opinion, on whether South Africa remained fit to govern South West Africa.
Around March 1962, SWAPO President [[Sam Nujoma]] visited the party's refugee camps across Tanzania, describing his recent petitions for South West African independence at the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the UN.
By 1964 others were also being sent to [[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[North Korea]] for military instruction.[51] In June of that year, SWAPO confirmed that it was irrevocably committed to the course of armed revolution.[5]
The formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU)'s Liberation Committee further strengthened SWAPO's international standing and ushered in an era of unprecedented political decline for SWANU.[51] The Liberation Committee had obtained approximately £20,000 in obligatory contributions from OAU member states; these funds were offered to both South West African nationalist movements.
However, as SWANU was unwilling to guarantee its share of the £20,000 would be used for armed struggle, this grant was awarded to SWAPO instead.[51] The OAU subsequently withdrew recognition from SWANU, leaving SWAPO as the sole beneficiary of pan-African legitimacy.[5] With OAU assistance, SWAPO opened diplomatic offices in [[Lusaka]], [[Cairo]], and [[London]].[51] SWANU belatedly embarked on a ten-year programme to raise its own guerrilla army.[5]
In September 1965, the first unit of six SWALA guerrillas, identified simply as "Group 1", departed the Kongwa refugee camp to infiltrate South West Africa.[42][2] Group 1 trekked first into Angola, before crossing the border into the Caprivi Strip.[2] Encouraged by South Africa's apparent failure to detect the initial incursion, larger insurgent groups made their own infiltration attempts in February and March 1966.[5] The second unit, "Group 2", was led by Leonard Philemon Shuuya,[5] also known by the nom de guerre "Castro" or "Leonard Nangolo".[42] Group 2 apparently become lost in Angola before it was able to cross the border, and the guerrillas dispersed after an incident in which they killed two shopkeepers and a vagrant.[2] Three were arrested by the Portuguese colonial authorities in Angola, who were working off tips received from local civilians.[2] Another eight, including Shuuya,[5] had been captured between March and May by the South African police, apparently in [[Kavangoland]].[42] Shuuya later resurfaced at Kongwa, claiming to have escaped his captors after his arrest.
Furthermore, the court found that while Ethiopia and Liberia had locus standi to institute proceedings on the matter, neither had enough vested legal interest in South West Africa to entitle them to a judgement of merits.[52] This ruling was met with great indignation by SWAPO and the OAU.[43] SWAPO officials immediately issued a statement from Dar es Salaam declaring that they now had "no alternative but to rise in arms" and "cross rivers of blood" in their march towards freedom.[51] Upon receiving the news, SWALA escalated its insurgency.[43] Its third group, which had infiltrated Ovamboland in July, attacked white-owned farms, traditional Ovambo leaders perceived as South African agents, and a border post.[5] The guerrillas set up camp at [[Omugulugwombashe]], one of five potential bases identified by SWALA's initial reconnaissance team as appropriate sites to train future recruits.[5] Here, they drilled up to thirty local volunteers between September 1965 and August 1966.[5] South African intelligence became aware of the camp by mid 1966 and identified its general location.[51] On 26 August 1966, the first major clash of the conflict took place when South African paratroops and paramilitary police units executed [[Operation Blouwildebees]] to capture or kill the insurgents.[49] SWALA had dug trenches around Omugulugwombashe for defensive purposes, but was taken by surprise and most of the insurgents quickly overpowered.[49] SWALA suffered 2 dead, 1 wounded, and 8 captured; the South Africans suffered no casualties.[49] This engagement is widely regarded in South Africa as the start of the Border War, and according to SWAPO, officially marked the beginning of its revolutionary armed struggle.[51][9]
According to SADF accounts, an unidentified informant had accompanied the security forces during the attack.[49] Sam Nujoma asserted that one of the eight guerrillas from the second group who were captured in Kavangoland was a South African [[Mole (espionage)]].[5] Suspicion immediately fell on Leonard "Castro" Shuuya.[42] SWALA suffered a second major reversal on 18 May 1967, when Tobias Hainyeko, its commander, was killed by the South African police.[43] Heinyeko and his men had been attempting to cross the [[Zambezi River]], as part of a general survey aimed at opening new lines of communication between the front lines in South West Africa and SWAPO's political leadership in Tanzania.[43] They were intercepted by a South African patrol, and the ensuing firefight left Heinyeko dead and two policemen seriously wounded.[43] Rumours again abounded that Shuuya was responsible, resulting in his dismissal and subsequent imprisonment.[42][5]
In the weeks following the raid on Omugulugwombashe, South Africa detained thirty-seven SWAPO politicians, namely [[Andimba Toivo ya Toivo]], Johnny Otto, Nathaniel Maxuilili, and Jason Mutumbulua.[35][51] Together with the captured SWALA guerrillas, they were jailed in Pretoria and held there until July 1967.
All were charged retroactively under the [[Terrorism Act, 1967]].[35] The state prosecuted the accused as Marxist revolutionaries seeking to establish a Soviet-backed regime in South West Africa.[51] In what became known as the "1967 Terrorist Trial", six of the accused were found guilty of committing violence in the act of insurrection, with the remainder convicted for armed intimidation, or having received  military training for the purpose of insurrection.[51] During the trial, the defendants unsuccessfully argued against allegations that they were privy to an external communist plot.[35] All but three received sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment on [[Robben Island]].[35]
Guerrillas began operating in larger groups to increase their chances of surviving encounters with the security forces, and refocused their efforts on infiltrating the civilian population.[43] Disguised as peasants, SWALA cadres could acquaint themselves with the terrain and observe South African patrols without arousing suspicion.[43] This was also a logistical advantage because they could only take what supplies they could carry while in the field; otherwise, the guerrillas remained dependent on sympathetic civilians for food, water, and other necessities.[43] On 29 July 1967, the SADF received intelligence that a large number of SWALA forces were congregated at Sacatxai, a settlement almost a hundred and thirty kilometres north of the border inside Angola.[49] South African [[North American T-6 Texan]] warplanes bombed Sacatxai on 1 August.[49] Most of their intended targets were able to escape, and in October 1968 two SWALA units crossed the border into Ovamboland.[9] This incursion was no more productive than the others and by the end of the year 178 insurgents had been either killed or apprehended by the police.[9]
Throughout the 1950s and much of the 1960s, a limited military service system by lottery was implemented in South Africa to comply with the needs of national defence.[53] Around mid 1967 the National Party government established universal [[Conscription]] for all white South African men as the SADF expanded to meet the growing insurgent threat.[53] From January 1968 onward there would be two yearly intakes of national servicemen undergoing nine months of military training.[53] The air strike on Sacatxai also marked a fundamental shift in South African tactics, as the SADF had for the first time indicated a willingness to strike at SWALA on foreign soil.[49] Although Angola was then an [[Overseas province]] of Portugal, Lisbon granted the SADF's request to mount punitive campaigns across the border.[24] In May 1967 South Africa established a new facility at [[Rundu]] to coordinate joint air operations between the SADF and the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]], and posted two permanent liaison officers at [[Menongue]] and [[Cuito Cuanavale]].[24]
As the war intensified, South Africa's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline, coinciding with an unparalleled wave of sympathy for SWAPO.[35] Despite the ICJ's advisory opinions to the contrary, as well as the dismissal of the case presented by Ethiopia and Liberia, the UN declared that South Africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of South West Africa, and had thus disavowed its own mandate.[54] The UN thereby assumed that the mandate was terminated, which meant South Africa had no further right to administer the territory, and that henceforth South West Africa would come under the direct responsibility of the General Assembly.[54] The post of [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia]] was created, as well as an ad hoc council, to recommend practical means for local administration.[54] South Africa maintained it did not recognise the jurisdiction of the UN with regards to the mandate and refused visas to the commissioner or the council.[54] On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which proclaimed that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed Namibia.[54] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 269]], adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of "Namibia" illegal.[54][55] In recognition of the UN's decision, SWALA was renamed the People's Liberation Army of Namibia.[42]
To regain the military initiative, the adoption of [[Land mine]] as an integral strategy of PLAN was discussed at a 1969–70 SWAPO consultative congress held in Tanzania.[55] PLAN's leadership backed the initiative to deploy land mines as a means of compensating for its inferiority in most conventional aspects to the South African security forces.[56] Shortly afterwards, PLAN began acquiring [[TM-46 mine]] from the Soviet Union, which were designed for anti-tank purposes, and produced some homemade "box mines" with [[TNT]] for anti-personnel use.[55] The mines were strategically placed along roads to hamper police convoys or throw them into disarray prior to an ambush; guerrillas also laid others along their infiltration routes on the long border with Angola.[57] The proliferation of mines in South West Africa initially resulted in heavy police casualties and would become one of the most defining features of PLAN's war effort for the next two decades.[57]
On 2 May 1971 a police van struck a mine, most likely a TM-46, in the Caprivi Strip.[55][58] The resulting explosion blew a crater in the road about two metres in diameter and sent the vehicle airborne, killing two senior police officers and injuring nine others.[58] This was the first mine-related incident recorded on South West African soil.[58] In October 1971, another police vehicle detonated a mine outside [[Katima Mulilo]], wounding four constables.[58] The following day, a fifth constable was mortally injured when he stepped on a second mine laid directly alongside the first.[58] This reflected a new PLAN tactic of laying anti-personnel mines parallel to their anti-tank mines to kill policemen or soldiers either engaging in preliminary mine detection or inspecting the scene of a previous blast.[56] In 1972, South Africa acknowledged that two more policemen had died and another three had been injured as a result of mines.[58]
The proliferation of mines in the Caprivi and other rural areas posed a serious concern to the South African government, as they were relatively easy for a PLAN cadre to conceal and plant with minimal chance of detection.[57] Sweeping the roads for mines with hand held mine detectors was possible, but too slow and tedious to be a practical means of ensuring swift police movement or keeping routes open for civilian use.[57] The SADF possessed some mine clearance equipment, including flails and ploughs mounted on tanks, but these were not considered practical either.[57] The sheer distances of road vulnerable to PLAN sappers every day was simply too vast for daily detection and clearance efforts.[57] For the SADF and the police, the only other viable option was the adoption of armoured personnel carriers with mine-proof hulls that could move quickly on roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was encountered.[57] This would evolve into a new class of military vehicle, the [[MRAP]] (MRAP).[57] By the end of 1972, the South African police were carrying out most of their patrols in the Caprivi Strip with mineproofed vehicles.[57]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 283]] was passed in June 1970 calling for all UN member states to close, or refrain from establishing, diplomatic or consular offices in South West Africa.[59] The resolution also recommended disinvestment, boycotts, and voluntary sanctions of that territory as long as it remained under South African rule.[59] In light of these developments, the Security Council sought the advisory opinion of the ICJ on the "legal consequences for states of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia".[59] There was initial opposition to this course of action from SWAPO and the OAU, because their delegates feared another inconclusive ruling like the one in 1966 would strengthen South Africa's case for annexation.[60] Nevertheless, the prevailing opinion at the Security Council was that since the composition of judges had been changed since 1966, a ruling in favour of the nationalist movement was more likely.[60] At the UN's request, SWAPO was permitted to lobby informally at the court and was even offered an observer presence in the courtroom itself.[60]
Vorster]] rejected it as "politically motivated", with no foundation in fact.[59] However, the decision inspired the bishops of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia]] to draw up an open letter to Vorster denouncing apartheid and South Africa's continued rule.[51] This letter was read in every black Lutheran congregation in the territory, and in a number of Catholic and Anglican parishes elsewhere.[51] The consequence of the letter's contents was increased militancy on the part of the black population, especially among the Ovambo people, who made up the bulk of SWAPO's supporters.[51] Throughout the year there were mass demonstrations against the South African government held in many Ovamboland schools.[51]
In December 1971, [[Jan de Wet]], Commissioner for the Indigenous Peoples of South West Africa, sparked off a [[1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike]] by 15,000 Ovambo workers in [[Walvis Bay]] when he made a public statement defending the territory's controversial contract labour regulations.[61] The strike quickly spread to municipal workers in Windhoek, and from there to the diamond, copper and tin mines, especially those at [[Tsumeb]], [[Grootfontein]], and [[Oranjemund]].[61] Later in the month, 25,000 Ovambo farm labourers joined what had become a nationwide strike affecting half the total workforce.[61] The South African police responded by arresting some of the striking workers and forcibly deporting the others to Ovamboland.[51] On 10 January 1972, an ad hoc strike committee led by Johannes Nangutuuala, was formed to negotiate with the South African government; the strikers demanded an end to contract labour, freedom to apply for jobs according to skill and interest and to quit a job if so desired, freedom to have a worker bring his family with him from Ovamboland while taking a job elsewhere, and for equal pay with white workers.[60]
The strike was later brought to an end after the South African government agreed to several concessions which were endorsed by Nangutuuala, including the implementation of uniform working hours and allowing workers to change jobs.[51] Responsibility for labour recruitment was also transferred to the tribal authorities in Ovamboland.[51] Thousands of the sacked Ovambo workers remained dissatisfied with these terms and refused to return to work.[51] They attacked tribal headmen, vandalised stock control posts and government offices, and tore down about a hundred kilometres of fencing along the border, which they claimed obstructed itinerant Ovambos from grazing their cattle freely.[61] The unrest also fueled discontent among [[Kwanyama dialect]]-speaking Ovambos in Angola, who destroyed cattle vaccination stations and schools and attacked four border posts, killing and injuring some SADF personnel as well as members of a Portuguese militia unit.[61] South Africa responded by declaring a [[State of emergency]] in Ovamboland on 4 February.[60] A [[Media blackout]] was imposed, white civilians evacuated further south, public assembly rights revoked, and the security forces empowered to detain suspicious persons indefinitely.[60] Police reinforcements were sent to the border, and in the ensuing crackdown they arrested 213 Ovambos.[61] South Africa was sufficiently alarmed at the violence to deploy a large SADF contingent as well.[61] They were joined by Portuguese troops who moved south from across the border to assist them.[60] By the end of March order had been largely restored and most of the remaining strikers returned to work.[60]
South Africa blamed SWAPO for instigating the strike and subsequent unrest.[60] While acknowledging that a significant percentage of the strikers were SWAPO members and supporters, the party's acting president [[Nathaniel Maxuilili]] noted that reform of South West African labour laws had been a longstanding aspiration of the Ovambo workforce, and suggested the strike had been organised shortly after the crucial ICJ ruling because they hoped to take advantage of its publicity to draw greater attention to their grievances.[60] The strike also had a politicising effect on much of the Ovambo population, as the workers involved later turned to wider political activity and joined SWAPO.[60] Around 20,000 strikers did not return to work but fled to other countries, mostly Zambia, where some were recruited as guerrillas by [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]].[51] Support for PLAN also increased among the rural Ovamboland peasantry, who were for the most part sympathetic with the strikers and resentful of their traditional chiefs' active collaboration with the police.[61]
The following year, South Africa transferred self-governing authority to Chief [[Fillemon Elifas Shuumbwa]] and the Ovambo legislature, effectively granting Ovamboland a limited form of [[Home rule]].[51] Voter turnout at the legislative elections was exceedingly poor, due in part to antipathy towards the local Ovamboland government and a SWAPO boycott of the polls.[51]
Swelled by thousands of new recruits and an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of heavy weapons, PLAN undertook more direct confrontations with the security forces in 1973.[58] Insurgent activity took the form of ambushes and selective target attacks, particularly in the Caprivi near the Zambian border.[62] On the evening of 26 January 1973 a heavily armed group of about 50 PLAN insurgents attacked a police base at Singalamwe, Caprivi with mortars, machine guns, and a single tube, man portable rocket launcher.[55][63] The police were ill-equipped to repel the attack and the base soon caught fire due to the initial rocket bombardment, which incapacitated both the senior officer and his second in command.[63] This marked the beginning of a new phase of the South African Border War in which the scope and intensity of PLAN raids were greatly increased.[49] By the end of 1973, PLAN's insurgency had engulfed six regions: Caprivi, Ovamboland, [[Kaokoland]], and Kavangoland.[49] It also had successfully recruited another 2,400 Ovambo and 600 Lozi guerrillas.[55] PLAN reports from late 1973 indicate that the militants planned to open up two new fronts in central South West Africa and carry out acts of urban insurrection in Windhoek, Walvis Bay, and other major urban centres.[49]
Until 1973, the South African Border War was perceived as a matter of law enforcement rather than a military conflict, reflecting a trend among Anglophone Commonwealth states to regard police as the principal force in the suppression of insurgencies.[5] The South African police did have paramilitary capabilities, and had previously seen action during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].[5] However, the failure of the police to prevent the escalation of the war in South West Africa led to the SADF assuming responsibility for all counter-insurgency campaigns on 1 April 1974.[49] The last regular South African police units were withdrawn from South West Africa's borders three months later, in June.[58] At this time there were about 15,000 SADF personnel being deployed to take their place.[61] The SADF's budget was increased by nearly 150% between 1973 and 1974 accordingly.[61] In August 1974, the SADF cleared a buffer strip about five kilometres wide which ran parallel to the Angolan border and was intensely patrolled and monitored for signs of PLAN infiltration.[61] This would become known as "the Cutline".[64]
On 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] ousted [[Marcelo Caetano]] and Portugal's right-wing [[Estado Novo (Portugal)]] government, sounding the death knell for the [[Portuguese Empire]].[65] The Carnation Revolution was followed by a period of instability in Angola, which threatened to erupt into civil war, and South Africa was forced to consider the unpalatable likelihood that a Soviet-backed regime there allied with SWAPO would in turn create increased military pressure on South West Africa.[66] PLAN incursions from Angola were already beginning to spike due to the cessation of patrols and active operations there by the Portuguese.[55]
In the last months of 1974, Portugal announced its intention to grant Angola independence and embarked on a series of hasty efforts to negotiate a power-sharing accord, the [[Alvor Agreement]], between rival Angolan nationalists.[67] There were three disparate nationalist movements then active in Angola, the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).[67] The three movements had all participated in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] and shared a common goal of liberating the country from colonial rule, but also claimed unique ethnic support bases, different ideological inclinations, and their own conflicting ties to foreign parties and governments.[67] Although each possessed vaguely socialist leanings, the MPLA was the only party which enjoyed close ties to the Soviet Union and was openly committed to Marxist policies.[67] Its adherence to the concept of an exclusive one-party state alienated it from the FNLA and UNITA, which began portraying themselves as anti-communist and pro-Western in orientation.[67]
South Africa believed that if the MPLA succeeded in seizing power, it would support PLAN militarily and lead to an unprecedented escalation of the fighting in South West Africa.[68] While the collapse of the Portuguese colonial state was inevitable, Pretoria hoped to install a moderate anti-communist government in its place, which in turn would continue cooperating with the SADF and work to deny PLAN bases on Angolan soil.[69] This led Prime Minister Vorster and South African intelligence chief [[Hendrik van den Bergh (police official)]] to embark on a major covert action programme in Angola, [[Operation Savannah (Angola)]].[68] Arms and money were secretly funnelled to the FNLA and UNITA, in exchange for their promised support against PLAN.[68] [[Jonas Savimbi]], UNITA's president, claimed he knew where PLAN's camps in southern Angola were located and was prepared to "attack, detain, or expel" PLAN fighters.[70] FNLA President [[Holden Roberto]] made similar assurances and promised that he would grant the SADF freedom of movement in Angola to pursue PLAN.[68]
Within days of the Alvor Agreement, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] launched its own programme, [[Operation IA Feature]], to arm the FNLA, with the stated objective of "prevent[ing] an easy victory by Soviet-backed forces in Angola".[71] The United States was searching for regional allies to take part in Operation IA Feature and perceived South Africa as the "ideal solution" in defeating the pro-Soviet MPLA.[72] With tacit American encouragement, the FNLA and UNITA began massing large numbers of troops in northern and southern Angola, respectively, in an attempt to gain tactical superiority.[66] The transitional government installed by the Alvor Agreement disintegrated and the MPLA requested support from its communist allies.[10] Between February and April 1975, the MPLA's armed wing, the [[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA), received shipments of Soviet arms, mostly channelled through Cuba or the [[People's Republic of the Congo]].[10] At the end of May, FAPLA personnel were being instructed in their use by a contingent of about 200 Cuban military advisers.[10][73] Over the next two months, they proceeded to inflict a series of crippling defeats on the FNLA and UNITA, which were driven out of the Angolan capital, [[Luanda]].[68]
— [[P.W. Botha]] addresses the South African parliament on the topic of Angola, September 1975[68]
To South African Minister of Defence [[P.W. Botha]], it was evident that the MPLA had gained the upper hand; in a memo dated late June 1975, he observed that the MPLA could "for all intents and purposes be considered the presumptive ultimate rulers of Angola...only drastic and unforeseeable developments could alter such an income."[68] Skirmishes at the [[Calueque]] hydroelectric dam, which supplied electricity to South West Africa, gave Botha the opportunity to escalate the SADF's involvement in Angola.[68] On 9 August, a thousand South African troops crossed into Angola and occupied Calueque.[71] While their public objective was to protect the hydroelectric installation and the lives of the civilian engineers employed there, the SADF was also intent on searching out PLAN cadres and weakening FAPLA.[74]
A watershed in the Angolan conflict was the South African decision on 25 October to commit 2,500 of its own troops to battle.[72][65] Larger quantities of more sophisticated arms had been delivered to FAPLA by this point, such as [[T-34]] tanks, wheeled armoured personnel carriers, towed rocket launchers and field guns.[75] While most of this hardware was antiquated, it proved extremely effective, given the fact that most of FAPLA's opponents consisted of disorganised, under-equipped militias.[75] In early October, FAPLA launched a major combined arms offensive on UNITA's national headquarters at [[Huambo]], which was only repelled with considerable difficulty and assistance from a small team of SADF advisers.[75] It became evident to the SADF that neither UNITA or the FNLA possessed armies capable of taking and holding territory, as their fighting strength depended on militias which excelled only in guerrilla warfare.[75] South Africa would need its own combat troops to not only defend its allies, but carry out a decisive counter-offensive against FAPLA.[75] This proposal was approved by the South African government on the condition that only a small, covert task force would be permitted.[66] SADF personnel participating in offensive operations were told to pose as mercenaries.[66] They were stripped of any identifiable equipment, including their [[Dog tag]], and re-issued with nondescript uniforms and weapons impossible to trace.[76]
On 22 October, the SADF airlifted more personnel and a squadron of [[Eland Mk7]] armoured cars to bolster UNITA positions at [[Kuito]].[75] Within days, they had overrun considerable territory and captured several strategic settlements.[74] The SADF's advance was so rapid that it often succeeded in driving FAPLA out of two or three towns in a single day.[74] Eventually the South African expeditionary force split into three separate columns of motorised infantry and armoured cars to cover more ground.[21] Pretoria intended for the SADF to help the FNLA and UNITA win the civil war before Angola's formal independence date, which the Portuguese had set for 11 November, then withdraw quietly.[66] By early November, the three SADF columns had captured eighteen major towns and cities, including several provincial capitals, and penetrated over five hundred kilometres into Angola.[74] Upon receiving intelligence reports that the SADF had openly intervened on the side of the FNLA and UNITA, the Soviet Union began preparations for a massive airlift of arms to FAPLA.[77]
On 3 November, a South African unit advancing towards [[Benguela]], Angola paused to attack a FAPLA base which housed a substantial training contingent of Cuban advisers.[77] When reports reached Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] that the advisers had been engaged by what appeared to be SADF regulars, he decided to approve a request from the MPLA leadership for direct military assistance.[77] Castro declared that he would send all "the men and weapons necessary to win that struggle",[77] in the spirit of [[Proletarian internationalism]] and solidarity with the MPLA.[74] Castro named this mission Operation Carlota after [[Carlota (rebel leader)]] who had organised a slave revolt on Cuba.[77]
The first Cuban combat troops began departing for Angola on 7 November, and were drawn from a special paramilitary battalion of the Cuban Ministry of Interior.[74] These were followed closely by one mechanised and one artillery battalion of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]], which set off by ship and would not reach Luanda until 27 November.[10] They were kept supplied by a [[Cuba–Angola airbridge]] carried out with Soviet aircraft.[10] The Soviet Union also deployed a small naval contingent and about 400 military advisers to Luanda.[10] Heavy weapons were flown and transported by sea directly from various Warsaw Pact member states to Angola for the arriving Cubans, including tanks, helicopters, armoured cars, and even 10 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighter aircraft, which were assembled by Cuban and Soviet technicians in Luanda.[74] By the end of the year, there were 12,000 Cuban soldiers inside Angola, nearly the size of the entire SADF presence in South West Africa.[21] The FNLA suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Quifangondo]] when it attempted to take Luanda on 10 November, and the capital remained in FAPLA hands by independence.[74]
Throughout late November and early December, the Cubans focused on fighting the FNLA in the north, and stopping an abortive incursion by [[Zaire]] on behalf of that movement.[74] Thereafter, they refocused on putting an end to the SADF advances in the south.[74] The South African and Cuban forces engaged in a series of bloody, but inconclusive skirmishes and battles throughout late December.[21] However, by this point word of the SADF's involvement had been leaked to the international press, and photographs of SADF armour behind UNITA lines were appearing in several European newspapers.[74] This proved to be a major political setback for the South African government, which was almost universally condemned for its interference in a black African country.[66] Moreover, it spurred influential African states such as [[Nigeria]] and Tanzania to recognise the MPLA as the sole legitimate government of Angola, as that movement's struggle against an apparent act of South African aggression gave it legitimacy at the OAU.[72]
In the aftermath of the MPLA's political and military victory, it was recognised as the official government of the new [[People's Republic of Angola]] by the [[European Economic Community]] and the UN General Assembly.[14] Around May 1976 the MPLA concluded several new agreements with Moscow for broad Soviet-Angolan cooperation in the diplomatic, economic, and military spheres; simultaneously both countries also issued a joint expression of solidarity with the Namibian struggle for independence.[80]
The emerging MPLA-SWAPO alliance took on special significance after the latter movement was wracked by factionalism and a series of PLAN mutinies in [[Western Province, Zambia]], Zambia between March and April 1976, known as the Shipanga Affair.[84] Relations between SWAPO and the Zambian government were already troubled due to the fact that the growing intensity of PLAN attacks on the Caprivi often provoked South African retaliation against Zambia.[85][86] When SWAPO's executive committee proved unable to suppress the PLAN revolt, the [[Zambian Defence Force]] (ZNDF) mobilised several army battalions[87] and drove the dissidents out of their bases in South West African refugee camps, detaining an estimated 1,800 PLAN members.[21] SWAPO's Secretary for Information, [[Andreas Shipanga]], was found responsible by the Zambian government for inciting the revolt.[84] Zambian president [[Kenneth Kaunda]] deported Shipanga and several other high-ranking dissidents to Tanzania, while incarcerating the others at remote army facilities.[87] Sam Nujoma accused them of being South African agents and carried out a purge of the surviving political leadership and PLAN ranks.[86][88] Forty mutineers were sentenced to death by a PLAN tribunal in Lusaka, while hundreds of others disappeared.[89] The heightened tension between Kaunda's government and PLAN began to have repercussions in the ZNDF.[61] Zambian officers and enlisted men confiscated PLAN arms and harassed loyal insurgents, straining relations and eroding morale.[61]
The crisis in Zambia prompted PLAN to relocate its headquarters from Lusaka to [[Lubango]], Angola, at the invitation of the MPLA.[5][88] It was joined shortly afterwards by SWAPO's political wing, which relocated to Luanda.[70] SWAPO's closer affiliation and proximity to the MPLA may have influenced its concurrent slide to the left;[81] the party adopted a more overtly Marxist discourse, such as a commitment to a classless society based on the ideals and principles of [[Scientific socialism]].[61] From 1976 onward, SWAPO considered itself the ideological as well as the military ally of the MPLA.[61]
In 1977, Cuba and the Soviet Union established dozens of new training camps in Angola to accommodate PLAN and two other guerrilla movements in the region, the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) and Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK).[14] The Cubans provided instructors and specialist officers, while the Soviets provided more hardware for the guerrillas.[14] This convergence of interests between the Cuban and Soviet military missions in Angola proved successful as it drew on each partner's comparative strengths.[14] The Soviet Union's strength lay in its vast military industry, which furnished the raw material for bolstering FAPLA and its allies.[14] Cuba's strength lay in its manpower and troop commitment to Angola, which included technical advisers who were familiar with the sophisticated weaponry supplied by the Soviets and possessed combat experience.[14] In order to reduce the likelihood of a South African attack, the training camps were sited near Cuban or FAPLA military installations, with the added advantage of being able to rely on the logistical and communications infrastructure of PLAN's allies.[5]
Access to Angola provided PLAN with limitless opportunities to train its forces in secure sanctuaries and infiltrate insurgents and supplies across South West Africa's northern border.[5] The guerrillas gained a great deal of leeway to manage their logistical operations through Angola's [[Namibe Province]], using the ports, roads, and railways from the sea to supply their forward operating bases.[91][92] Soviet vessels offloaded arms at the [[Namibe]], which were then transshipped by rail to Lubango and from there through a chain of PLAN supply routes snaking their way south towards the border.[91] "Our geographic isolation was over," Nujoma commented in [[Where Others Wavered]].
In the territories of Ovamboland, Kaokoland, Kavangoland and [[East Caprivi]] after 1976, the SADF installed fixed defences against infiltration, employing two parallel electrified fences and motion sensors.[1] The system was backed by roving patrols drawn from Eland armoured car squadrons, motorised infantry, canine units, horsemen and scrambler motorcycles for mobility and speed over rough terrain; local [[San people]] trackers, Ovambo paramilitaries, and [[South African special forces]].[1][93] PLAN attempted hit-and-run raids across the border but, in what was characterised as the "corporal's war", SADF [[Section (military unit)]] largely intercepted them in the Cutline before they could get any further into South West Africa itself.[94][21] The brunt of the fighting was shouldered by small, mobile rapid reaction forces, whose role was to track and eliminate the insurgents after a PLAN presence was detected.[95] These reaction forces were attached on the battalion level and maintained at maximum readiness on individual bases.[1]
The SADF carried out mostly reconnaissance operations inside Angola, although its forces in South West Africa could fire and manoeuvre across the border in self-defence if attacked from the Angolan side.[57][96] Once they reached the Cutline, a reaction force sought permission either to enter Angola or abort the pursuit.[57] South Africa also set up a specialist unit, [[32 Battalion (South Africa)]], which concerned itself with reconnoitring infiltration routes from Angola.[90][97] 32 Battalion regularly sent teams recruited from ex-FNLA militants and led by white South African personnel into an authorised zone up to fifty kilometres deep in Angola; it could also dispatch platoon-sized reaction forces of similar composition to attack vulnerable PLAN targets.[90] As their operations had to be clandestine and covert, with no link to South African forces, 32 Battalion teams wore FAPLA or PLAN uniforms and carried Soviet weapons.[90][23]
Climate shaped the activities of both sides.[98] Seasonal variations during the summer passage of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] resulted in an annual period of heavy rains over northern South West Africa between February and April.[98] The rainy season made military operations difficult.
Thickening foliage provided the insurgents with concealment from South African patrols, and their tracks were obliterated by the rain.[98] At the end of April or early May, PLAN cadres returned to Angola to escape renewed SADF [[Search and destroy]] efforts and retrain for the following year.[98]
The main arteries for SADF bases on the border were two highways leading west to [[Ruacana]] and north to Oshikango, and a third which stretched from Grootfontein through Kavangoland to Rundu.[23] Much of this vital road infrastructure was vulnerable to guerrilla sabotage: innumerable road culverts and bridges were blown up and rebuilt multiple times over the course of the war.[49][99] After their destruction PLAN saboteurs sowed the surrounding area with land mines to catch the South African engineers sent to repair them.[20] One of the most routine tasks for local sector troops was a morning patrol along their assigned stretch of highway to check for mines or overnight sabotage.[20] Despite their efforts, it was nearly impossible to guard or patrol the almost limitless number of vulnerable points on the road network, and losses from mines mounted steadily; for instance, in 1977 the SADF suffered 16 deaths due to mined roads.[58] Aside from road sabotage, the SADF was also forced to contend with regular ambushes of both military and civilian traffic throughout Ovamboland.[20] Movement between towns was by escorted convoy, and the roads in the north were closed to civilian traffic between six in the evening and half past seven in the morning.[20] White civilians and administrators from [[Oshakati]], [[Ondangwa]], and Rundu began routinely carrying arms, and never ventured far from their fortified neighbourhoods.[23]
PLAN's leadership under [[Dimo Hamaambo]] concentrated on improving its communications and control throughout that country, demarcating the Angolan front into three military zones, in which guerrilla activities were coordinated by a single operational headquarters.[92] The Western Command was headquartered in western [[Huíla Province]] and responsible for PLAN operations in Kaokoland and western Ovamboland.[92] The Central Command was headquartered in central Huíla Province and responsible for PLAN operations in central Ovamboland.[92] The Eastern Command was headquartered in northern Huíla Province and responsible for PLAN operations in eastern Ovamboland and Kavangoland.[92]
On 27 October 1977, a group of insurgents attacked a SADF patrol in the Cutline, killing 5 South African soldiers and mortally wounding a sixth.[101] As military historian Willem Steenkamp records, "while not a large clash by World War II or Vietnam standards, it was a milestone in what was then...a [[Low intensity conflict]]".[94] Three months later, insurgents fired on patrols in the Cutline again, killing six more soldiers.[94] The growing number of ambushes and infiltrations were timed to coincide with assassination attempts on prominent South West African tribal officials.[94] Perhaps the most high-profile assassination of a tribal leader during this time was that of Herero chief [[Clemens Kapuuo]], which South Africa blamed on PLAN.[5] Vorster finally acquiesced to Botha's requests for retaliatory strikes against PLAN in Angola, and the SADF launched [[Operation Reindeer]] in May 1978.[101][94]
One controversial development of Operation Reindeer helped sour the international community on the South African Border War.[42] On 4 May 1978, a battalion-sized task force of the [[44 Parachute Brigade (South Africa)]] conducted a sweep through the Angolan mining town of [[Cassinga]], searching for what it believed was a PLAN administrative centre.[94] Lieutenant General [[Constand Viljoen]], the chief of the South African Army, had told the task force commanders and his immediate superior General [[Johannes Geldenhuys]] that Cassinga was a PLAN "planning headquarters" which also functioned as the "principal medical centre for the treatment of seriously injured guerrillas, as well as the concentration point for guerrilla recruits being dispatched to training centres in Lubango and Luanda and to operational bases in east and west [[Cunene Province]]."[102] The task force was made up of older [[Citizen Force (South Africa)]] reservists, many of whom had already served tours on the border, led by experienced professional officers.[102]
An adjacent Cuban mechanised infantry battalion stationed sixteen kilometres to the south advanced to confront the paratroops during the attack, but suffered several delays due to strafing runs by South African [[Dassault Mirage III]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] strike aircraft.[104] In the first known engagement between South African and Cuban forces since the termination of Operation Savannah, five Cuban T-34-85 tanks and some infantry in [[BTR-152]] armoured personnel carriers reached Cassinga while the paratroopers were being airlifted out by helicopter.[102] This led to a protracted firefight in which Cuba acknowledged 16 dead and over 80 wounded.[104] The Cassinga event was given special significance by Cuban historians such as Jorge Risquet, who noted that it marked the first time that "Cubans and Namibians shed their blood together fighting the South African [military]."[104]
On 6 May 1978, Operation Reindeer was condemned by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 428]], which described it as a violation of Angola's territorial integrity and threatened punitive measures should the SADF attempt another incursion on Angolan soil.[42] The resolution attracted almost unanimous support worldwide, and was endorsed not only by the Soviet Union, but by major Western powers such as the US, the UK, France, Canada, and West Germany.[42] As the Cassinga incident received publicity, American and European attitudes became one of intense criticism of South African purpose as well as the process by which it carried out the war.[42] Notably, Western pressure at the UN to recognise South Africa as an equal partner in any future Namibian peace settlement evaporated.[68]
Vorster's failing health and his preoccupation with domestic issues such as the looming [[Muldergate Scandal]] diverted his attention from South West Africa from May to September 1978, and no more major operations were undertaken by the SADF during that period.[105] However, his absence from military affairs meant he was no longer in a position to counter the hawkish position of P.W. Botha and the defence establishment.[105] When Vorster voluntarily stepped down late that year, he was succeeded by Botha as prime minister.[105] His final act in office was to reject a proposal drafted by UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]] for a ceasefire and transition to Namibian independence.[70]
Defence chiefs such as General [[Magnus Malan]] welcomed Botha's ascension, blaming previous battlefield reversals—namely, Operation Savannah—on Vorster's indecisive and "lackluster" leadership.[105] Botha had generated a reputation for being a tenacious, uncompromising leader who would use South Africa's position of military strength to strike hard at its foreign enemies, particularly to retaliate against any form of armed provocation.[105] He criticised the West and the US in particular as being unwilling to stand up to Soviet expansionism, and declared that if South Africa could no longer look to the "[[Free world]]" for support, then it would prevent further communist inroads into the region itself.[105] Within the first three months of his premiership, the length of military service for white conscripts was doubled, and construction began on several new SADF bases near the border.[105] Although little in the tactical situation had changed when Botha assumed office, patrols now crossed into Angola much more frequently to intercept and destroy PLAN cadres along their known infiltration routes.[106]
"Strike a hard blow which Pretoria will not forget in a long time," deputy PLAN commander [[Solomon Huwala]] stated in a written directive to his staff.
Cassinga must be revenged."[50] It was from this communique that the name of the next major PLAN offensive was derived: Operation Revenge.[50] After some deliberation, Huwala chose Katima Mulilo as his target and dispatched several PLAN reconnaissance teams to obtain data on firing positions and potential artillery observation posts.[50] On 23 August 1978, PLAN bombarded Katima Mulilo with mortars and rocket fire, killing 10 SADF personnel.[43] The next day, General Viljoen, General Geldenhuys and the Administrator-General of South West Africa flew out to Katima Mulilo to inspect the damage.[43] All three narrowly escaped death when their [[Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon]] helicopter took ground fire from PLAN anti-aircraft positions at [[Sesheke]].[43] The SADF responded by bombarding Sesheke with its own artillery and making a sweep for PLAN insurgents up to a hundred kilometers north of the Cutline.[43]
On 6 March 1979, Prime Minister Botha ordered retaliatory strikes on selected targets in Angola and Zambia.[107] The respective code names for the operations were Rekstok and Saffraan.[108] Heliborne South African troops landed in the vicinity of four Angolan settlements: Heque, Mongua, Oncocua, Henhombe, and Muongo, which they canvassed for guerrillas.[108] The SADF remained in Zambia for a significantly longer period, carrying out a series of uneventful combat patrols and ambushes for five weeks.[58] While Operations Rekstok and Saffraan were unsuccessful in terms of tactical results, they did interrupt PLAN's attempts to rebuild its base camps near the border.[108] Most of the insurgents apparently concealed their arms and vanished into the local population.[7] This proved less successful in Zambia, where the civilians in [[Sesheke District]] were irritated by the constant presence of South African patrols and reconnaissance aircraft; they demanded their government remove the remaining PLAN fighters.[7] President Kaunda subsequently bowed to pressure and ordered PLAN to close its rear base facilities in Zambia, resulting in the collapse of its Caprivi insurgency.[58]
On 16 March, Angola lodged a formal complaint with the UN Security Council concerning the violation of its borders and airspace as a result of Operation Rekstok.[109] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 447]] was passed in response.[109] The resolution "condemned strongly the racist regime of South Africa for its premeditated, persistent, and sustained armed invasions of the People's Republic of Angola, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country as well as a serious threat to international peace and security".[110] A UN commission of inquiry logged 415 border violations by the SADF in 1979, an increase of 419% since the previous year.[106] It also made note of 89 other incidents, which were mostly airspace violations or artillery bombardments that struck targets on Angolan soil.[106]
US–South African relations took an unexpected turn with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral victory in the [[1980 United States presidential election]].
Reagan's tough anti-communist record and rhetoric was greeted with cautious optimism by Pretoria;[111] during his election campaign he'd described the geopolitical situation in southern Africa as "a Russian weapon" aimed at the US.[112] President Reagan and his [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]] [[Chester Crocker]] adopted a policy of [[Constructive engagement]] with the Botha government, restored military attachés to the US embassy in South Africa, and permitted SADF officers to receive technical training in the US.[113] They believed that pressure tactics against South Africa would be contrary to US regional goals, namely countering Soviet and Cuban influence.[112] In a private memo addressed to the South African foreign minister, Crocker and his supervisor [[Alexander Haig]] declared that "we [the US] share your view that Namibia must not be turned over to the Soviets and their allies.
Between 1979 and 1980, the pace of infiltration had accelerated so greatly that the SADF was forced to mobilise its reserves and deploy another 8,000 troops to South West Africa.[105] The deeper South African raids struck into Angola, the more the war spread, and by mid-1980 the fighting had extended to a much larger geographic area than before.[105] Operation Sceptic, then the largest combined arms offensive undertaken by South Africa since World War II, was launched in June against a PLAN base at Chifufua, over a hundred and eighty kilometres inside Angola.[50] Chifufua, codenamed Objective Smokeshell, was divided into a dozen well fortified complexes ringed with trenches, defensive bunkers, and anti-aircraft positions.[119] The SADF killed over 200 insurgents and captured several hundred tonnes of PLAN munitions and weaponry at the cost of 17 dead.[105] Operation Protea was mounted on an even larger scale and inflicted heavier PLAN casualties; unlike Sceptic, it was to involve significant FAPLA losses as well as the seizure of substantial amounts of Angolan military hardware and supplies.[120] Protea was planned when the SADF first became aware of PLAN's evolving conventional capabilities in August 1981.[121] Its targets were suspected PLAN bases sited outside major FAPLA installations at [[Ondjiva]] and [[Xangongo]].[21] Attacking either settlement was considered especially risky due to the presence of Soviet advisers and a comprehensive local FAPLA air defence network.[105]
Since the first formal cooperation treaties between Angola and the Soviet Union in 1976, the military sphere had constituted the pivot of Angolan-Soviet relations.[80] The Soviet Navy benefited from its use of Angolan ports to stage exercises throughout the southern Atlantic and even negotiated with FAPLA for the construction of permanent bases.[122] Luanda was named the regional headquarters for the 30th Operation Squadron of the Soviet Navy's [[Northern Fleet]], which comprised eleven warships, three of which were in the port at any given time.[123] From January 1976 onward, it also replaced [[Conakry]] as the primary base for Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95]] reconnaissance flights along Africa's western coast.[123] Article 16 of the Angolan constitution banned the construction of foreign military bases, but exceptions could be made if base rights were considered essential to the country's national defence.[122] The Soviet Union justified its continued air and naval presence as necessary measures to protect Angola from a South African invasion.[124] One senior Soviet military official, General Valery Belyaev, remarked that the 30th Operational Squadron was, "by the very fact of its presence...restraining the South African aggression against Angola."[124]
A few weeks prior to Operation Protea, SADF General [[Charles Lloyd (South Africa)]] warned Botha that the introduction of early-warning radar and [[2K12 Kub]] missiles[10] in southern Angola was making it difficult to provide air support to ground operations there.[105] Lloyd mentioned that FAPLA's buildup of modern Soviet arms was making a conventional war more likely.[105] The objectives of Operation Protea shifted accordingly: aside from the PLAN camps, the SADF was ordered to neutralise several Angolan radar and missile sites and command posts.[105] Eight days of bloody fighting occurred before two South African armoured columns were able to overrun Ondjiva and Xangongo.[105][21] The SADF destroyed all of FAPLA's 2K12 missile sites[10] and captured an estimated 3,000 tonnes of Soviet-manufactured equipment, including a dozen T-34-85 and PT-76 tanks, 200 trucks and other wheeled vehicles, and 110 [[9K32 Strela-2]] missile launchers.[105] The SADF acknowledged 14 dead.[125] Combined FAPLA and PLAN losses were over 1,000 dead and 38 taken prisoner.[125] The Soviet military mission suffered 2 dead and 1 taken prisoner.[125]
FAPLA's modest air force, consisting of a handful of transports and a few MiG-21s, maintained a large base at Menongue.[98] During Protea and Daisy the SADF scrambled its own fighters to overfly the base during ground operations and prevent the FAPLA aircraft from taking off.[98] The Soviets had begun training Angolan MiG pilots, but in the meantime Cubans shouldered the burden of the air war in Angola, flying in support of both FAPLA and PLAN.[98][10] In November 1981 a MiG-21MF with a Cuban pilot was shot down by South African [[Mirage F1]]CZs over the [[Cunene River]].[55][127] The Mirages reportedly downed a second MiG in October 1982, however this second shootdown has been disputed by Cuban sources.[127][128]
The expulsion of FAPLA from most of Cunene Province marked a revival of fortunes for Jonas Savimbi and his rump UNITA movement, which was able to seize undefended towns and settlements abandoned in the wake of Operations Protea and Daisy.[121] Savimbi focused on rebuilding his power base throughout southeastern Angola while FAPLA and its Cuban allies were otherwise preoccupied fighting the SADF.[121] For its part, the SADF allowed UNITA's [[Armed Forces of the Liberation of Angola]] to operate freely behind its lines; by early 1983 Savimbi's insurgents controlled most of the country south of [[Benguela Province]].[121]
To demonstrate South African commitment to Namibian independence, Botha permitted a moderate, multi-party coalition to create a South West African interim government in August 1983, known as the Multi-Party Conference and subsequently as the [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Namibia)]].[111] Provision was made for an executive and legislative assembly, and the new government was bestowed with all the powers formerly held by the territory's Administrator-General.[111] The rise of an interim government was accompanied by a defence policy dubbed "Namibianisation", a reference to the [[Vietnamization]] programme the US had pursued during the Vietnam War.[1] Increasingly the South African war effort rested on what limited white manpower could be raised in South West Africa itself, and local black units drawn from the San, Ovambo, [[Kavango people]], and [[Lozi people]] ethnic groups.[133] The main objectives of Namibianisation were to establish a self-sufficient military infrastructure in South West Africa, reduce casualty rates among South African personnel, and reinforce the perception of a domestic civil conflict rather than an independence struggle.[118]
The SADF had started recruiting black South West Africans in 1974 and established segregated military and paramilitary units for semi-autonomous tribal entities such as Ovamboland two years later.[118] PLAN had previously benefited from the deployment of white South African conscripts, reservists, and policemen unfamiliar with the terrain or environment; indigenous recruits were perceived as a means of mitigating this disadvantage.[95] In April 1980, Administrator-General [[Gerrit Viljoen]] announced that transfer of some control over military and police forces to South West Africans would occur once the necessary structures were implemented.[118] Through its defence headquarters in Windhoek, the SADF had exercised final authority on all military resources and counter-insurgency efforts.[1] In theory, these arrangements were modified by the establishment of the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) and the [[South West African Police]] (SWAPOL), since both of these forces were placed under the control of the interim government; the latter was also empowered to implement and oversee conscription as it saw fit.[1] However, the SADF retained functional command of all military units; the senior general officer of the SADF in South West Africa also doubled as commander of the SWATF.[1] By the mid 1980s the SWATF numbered about 21,000 personnel and accounted for 61% of all combat troops deployed along the Cutline.[118] Both the SWATF and the Government of National Unity remained dependent on massive SADF military support.[115]
Operation Protea had exposed a glaring lack of professionalism on the part of FAPLA units, which had relied too heavily on their Soviet advisers and were almost immediately routed once they had to leave their fortified bases.[120] In terms of training, morale, organisation, and professional competence—including the ability to operate its own equipment with effectiveness—the Angolan army had proved decidedly vulnerable.[120] Protea indicated that it was in no condition to repel or even inflict serious losses on the South African expeditionary troops, resulting in a ratio of casualties almost overwhelmingly in the SADF's favour.[120] That debacle led to a greater FAPLA dependency on augmented Cuban forces and another large arms deal, valued in excess of one billion dollars, being signed with the Soviet Union.[80] Defence expenditures increased to consume 50% of Angola's state budget by the end of 1982.[131] FAPLA embarked on a massive recruiting drive, purchased new [[55]] and [[T-62]] tanks from the Soviet Union, and took delivery of about thirty new combat aircraft, including twelve [[Sukhoi Su-17]] strike fighters.[134][80] It also ordered more air search radars and surface-to-air missiles to replace those destroyed in Protea.[134]
Their confidence buoyed by the previous successful incursions into FAPLA-held territory, which had achieved marked success at only minimal cost in lives and materiel, Botha and his defence chiefs scheduled Operation Askari for December 1983.[114] Like Protea, Askari was a major combined arms assault on PLAN base areas and supply lines in Angola; it also targeted nearby FAPLA air-defence installations and brigade headquarters.[135] According to General [[Georg Meiring]], commander of the SADF in South West Africa, Askari would serve the purpose of a preemptive strike aimed at eliminating the large numbers of PLAN insurgents and stockpiles of weapons being amassed for the annual rainy season infiltration.[114]
The buildup of South African armour and artillery on the border did not go unnoticed; by late November the Soviet Union had enough satellite reconnaissance photographs and other intelligence to deduce that the SADF was preparing for another major incursion into Angola.[10] During a private meeting arranged at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] by UN Secretary-General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] at Moscow's request, Soviet diplomats informed their South African counterparts that further aggression towards FAPLA would not be tolerated.[10] The Soviets threatened unspecified retaliation if FAPLA's grip on Angola disintegrated further as a result of Askari.[10] Simultaneously, in a direct show of force, a Soviet aircraft carrier and three surface ships called at Luanda before rounding the Cape of Good Hope.[136] This constituted the most powerful Soviet naval detachment which had ever approached within striking distance of South African waters.[136] Botha was unmoved, and Askari proceeded as scheduled on 9 December.[70] Its targets were several large PLAN training camps, all of which were located no more than five kilometres from an adjacent FAPLA brigade headquarters.[135] The four local FAPLA brigades represented one-seventh of the entire Angolan army, and three had substantial Soviet advisory contingents.[70] Soviet General [[Valentin Varennikov]], who was instrumental in directing the Angolan defence, was confident that "given their numerical strength and armament, the brigades...[would] be able to repel any South African attack".[70] FAPLA's Cuban allies were less optimistic: they noted that the brigades were isolated, incapable of reinforcing each other quickly, and possessed insufficient mobile anti-aircraft weapons to protect them outside their bases.[70] The Soviets recommended a static defence, appealing directly to Angolan President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], while the Cubans urged a withdrawal.[70] Caught between two conflicting recommendations, dos Santos hesitated, and the brigades were ultimately annihilated piecemeal by the advancing South African armoured columns.[70] Amid the confusion, a number of Angolan troops managed to break out of the South African encirclement and move north to link up with Cuban units,[70] but a total of 471 FAPLA/PLAN personnel were killed or captured.[137]
On 6 January 1984, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 546]] was adopted with thirteen votes in favour and two abstentions, by the US and UK.[70] The resolution condemned Operation Askari and demanded South Africa's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Angola.[70] An earlier draft of the same text imposing mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa until it ceased cross-border raids was abandoned under American pressure.[70] The Soviet Union announced that it had reached yet another, more comprehensive agreement with Angola to bolster FAPLA's defence capabilities, and delivered the public warning to South Africa that "further aggression cannot be left unpunished".[136][105]
Askari had shaken the South African government's confidence in its ability to retain the military advantage indefinitely in Angola.[105] Heavier and more sophisticated weapons were being used, the rate of casualties had increased, and the air superiority that had accounted for many of the SADF's previous successes was diminishing.[105][114] Nor was Botha and his cabinet certain of continued political and diplomatic support from the US, which had chosen to abstain rather than exercise its veto with regard to UN Security Council Resolution 546.[105] The Reagan administration perceived that both Angola and South Africa had grown weary of the war and were more susceptible to pressure for a ceasefire and mutual disengagement.[105] American diplomats offered to mediate peace talks accordingly, and on 13 February South African and Angolan officials met for the first time in Lusaka.[70] Three days later, South Africa announced that it would withdraw its expeditionary forces from Cunene Province by the end of March,[138] provided the Angolans agreed to prevent PLAN from taking advantage of the situation to infiltrate South West Africa.[105] The Angolan government pledged to restrain PLAN and MK, and to prohibit any movement of Cuban troops southward towards the border.[121] These respective commitments were formalised as the [[Lusaka Accords]].[121] FAPLA and the SADF agreed to set up a Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC) to police the disengagement.[70] Under the JMC, joint South African and Angolan patrols were carried out along six hundred kilometres of the border.[114]
The truce between South Africa and Angola survived only about fifteen months.[70] Negotiations for completing the SADF withdrawal were stalled due to intransigence on both sides concerning the linkage policy, with the two governments clashing over timetables for the withdrawal of Cuban troops and Namibian independence, respectively.[70] While the Soviet Union and Cuba did nothing to impede the dialogue, they feared that Luanda might sacrifice PLAN and MK by agreeing to expel them from the country.[70] Castro confided to Soviet officials that he had no intention of authorising a withdrawal of Cuban forces if the Angolan government signed a non-aggression pact with South Africa similar to the [[Nkomati Accord]].[70] As a last resort, the Cuban presence in Angola would be maintained unilaterally for the purpose of aiding PLAN, with or without Luanda's approval.[70]
In October 1984, dos Santos blamed South Africa for stalling the implementation of the Lusaka Accords and called for the US to resolve the impasse by exerting pressure on Botha.[116] On 17 November, dos Santos proposed a five-point peace plan on the following terms: a complete SADF withdrawal from Angola, a renewed ceasefire agreement, a formal pledge by the South African government to begin implementing Namibian independence under the terms of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435]], a formal pledge by the Angolan government to begin implementing a three year phased withdrawal of all but 5,000 Cuban troops, and recognition of SWAPO and Cuba as an equal party in negotiations.[116] Botha wanted all the Cuban military personnel to be withdrawn, and over a period of twelve months rather than three years.[116] He also countered that the Namibian independence process could only take place once the Cuban withdrawal was initiated.[116]
The Lusaka Accords were abandoned in the wake of [[Operation Argon]], a failed sabotage mission carried out by South African special forces in Angola's oil-rich [[Cabinda Province]].[121] Four years of military escalation and massive defence expenditures had a drastic impact on Angola's state finances, which were only being balanced by petroleum revenue.[131] The largest oil refinery in the country was located on the Cabindan coast and operated by a US firm, [[Gulf Oil]], under the auspices of the Cabina-Gulf Oil National Petroleum Company of Angola (SONAGOL).[116] By 1984 Gulf had invested over 1.3 billion dollars in its Cabinda operation, which was exporting 165,495 barrels of oil per day.[116] At the time, the revenue from the Gulf refinery generated 90% of Angola's foreign exchange.[116] The Reagan administration separated its political positions on Angola from its position on SONAGOL, with Crocker hoping that American multinational companies in general, and Gulf in particular, would be a moderating force on the Marxist government.[116] South Africa had noted the critical importance of the refinery's contribution to the FAPLA war effort and had begun investigating ways to disrupt it without incurring the ire of the US, which would have to react if American commercial interests were threatened.[91] The SADF believed that a covert sabotage operation was possible, as long as the destruction was not attributable to South Africa and a credible cover story could be used to link the attack to a domestic Angolan movement such as UNITA or the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC).[91] An attack on the oil platforms was ruled out, as this was beyond the capabilities of either UNITA or FLEC, so the SADF opted to infiltrate the refinery's oil storage facilities and mine the fuel tanks.[91] The damage incurred would cripple Angola's ability to finance its military operations and give it greater economic incentive to accede to South African demands in the ongoing negotiations rather than risk returning to war.[139]
In early 1984, just after South Africa and Angola had agreed to the principles of a peace settlement, UNITA had seized the opportunity to issue its own demanding conditions under which it would also accept the terms of a ceasefire.[142] Savimbi requested a government of national unity with the MPLA in which he was granted a part, and threatened to begin attacking major cities if he was ignored.[142] In this manner Savimbi sought to interlace conditionality over an SADF and FAPLA disengagement with his own conflict of interests with the Angolan regime.[142] Although Botha approved of UNITA as an ostensibly anti-communist movement, he did nothing to impress Savimbi's demands on dos Santos.[114] UNITA responded by raiding [[Sumbe]], a settlement two hundred and sixty kilometres to the south of Luanda.[142] That June, UNITA sabotaged the oil pipeline in Cabinda, kidnapping 16 British expatriate workers and a Portuguese technician.[142] Six months later the insurgents raided [[Cafunfo]], killing 100 FAPLA personnel.[142] Most of these attacks were planned and executed from [[Jamba, Cuando Cubango]], a town in [[Cuando Cubango Province]], which Savimbi had proclaimed UNITA's new national headquarters.[143] Jamba had no prior strategic significance, possessed no agricultural base, and had limited access to fresh water, but it was located as far away from FAPLA bases as possible and within easy reach of SADF bases in Ovamboland and the Caprivi Strip.[143] FAPLA had deserted the region for precisely this reason, withdrawing north after Operation Protea,[55] but in the process left behind a power vacuum which Savimbi was quick to exploit.[121] Savimbi used Jamba to augment UNITA's public image, investing heavily in local infrastructure.[143] He opened the settlement to American and South African journalists, honed his public relations skills in frequent press conferences denouncing the MPLA, and lobbied for Western aid.[143] Under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the US government opened covert channels to provide military assistance to UNITA.[116] It repealed the [[Clark Amendment]], which explicitly barred further CIA support for the UNITA and the FNLA, allowing the agency to resume Angolan operations.[144] The Angolan government asserted this was "proof of the complicity there has always been between the US executive and the retrograde racist Pretoria regime" and it had "no alternative but to suspend the contacts it has had with US government envoys".[141]
In 1986, Savimbi visited Washington, where he met with American officials and was promised military hardware valued at about ten million dollars, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] surface-to-air missiles and [[BGM-71 TOW]] anti-tank missiles.[114] The US also pledged to continue its support for UNITA even if it lost the umbrella of protection conferred by the SADF presence in southern Angola.[144]
US and South African justification for arming UNITA lay partly in the increased supply by the Soviet Union of more sophisticated weapons to FAPLA, as well as the increased number of Cuban troops in Angola, which had rapidly swelled from 25,000 to 31,000 by the end of 1985.[111] While the Lusaka Accords were still in force, the Cuban and Soviet military delegations had urged dos Santos to take advantage of the ceasefire with the SADF to eliminate UNITA.[80] There was a considerable increase in Soviet military assistance to Angola during this period, with the transfer of another billion dollars' worth of arms to FAPLA, including about 200 new T-55 and T-62 tanks.[80] Moscow trained more Angolan pilots and delivered more advanced fighter aircraft to Luanda, particularly [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]].[10] Over a three year period Angola had become the second largest importer of arms on the African continent.[91] FAPLA's arsenal expanded so exponentially that the SADF became convinced that the Soviet-sponsored arms buildup was intended for deployment elsewhere.[111] General Malan gave a speech in which he expressed alarm at the "flood" of Soviet military equipment and its sophisticated nature, claiming that it was much more than needed to cope with the SADF's limited expeditionary forces and UNITA.[111] Malan theorised that "the Russians want to develop a strong, stabilised base in Angola and then use the equipment and personnel positioned there wherever necessary in the subcontinent".[111] South Africa gradually became locked in a conventional arms race with Angola; each side argued that it had to match the increased force available to the other.[147] To counter the appearance of advanced MiG-23 and [[Sukhoi Su-17]] fighters in Angola, for instance, South Africa began development on two sophisticated fighter aircraft of its own, the [[Atlas Cheetah]] and the [[Atlas Carver]].[148] Both programmes would consume billions of rand.[146]
Intending to wrest back the initiative, sever UNITA's logistics lifelines to South West Africa and Zaire, and forestall any future insurgent offensives, FAPLA launched [[Operation Saluting October]] in mid-1987.[124] The impetus for Saluting October likely originated with the Soviet military mission, which pressed the idea of a major conventional thrust to destroy UNITA's southeastern front as early as 1983.[124] It had received a new commander that year, Lieutenant General [[Pyotr Gusev (soldier)]], former deputy commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].[124] In light of the war's length, its cost, the rising death toll, and looming cuts in the Soviet military expenditure which would limit future efforts to support FAPLA's war effort, Gusev wanted a decisive multi-divisional offensive to crush UNITA once and for all.[149] Operation Saluting October was a two-pronged offensive aimed at retaking three major settlements from UNITA, Cangamba, Cassamba, and [[Mavinga]].[9][55] The FAPLA command staff intended the attack on Cangamba and Cassamba as a feint, hoping to draw UNITA forces there and away from Mavinga.[9][55] Once Mavinga was in government hands, FAPLA could expel the remaining insurgents from [[Moxico Province]] and pave the way for a final assault on Savimbi's headquarters at Jamba.[9] Between 4 and 9 Soviet advisers were to be attached on the battalion level, albeit with strict orders not to participate in the fighting and withdraw from the front as necessary to avoid contact with UNITA.[10] They were accompanied by a small number of Cuban advisers and East German technical personnel serving in a variety of support roles.[9][10]
Gusev and his staff appealed to Moscow for more aid to FAPLA, particularly strike aircraft, for another offensive; this request was granted.[149] In what had become an annual practice, an estimated billion dollars' worth of arms was flown into Luanda by Soviet [[Antonov An-24]] flights, as many as 12 per day for a six-month period.[10] The equipment was offloaded in the capital and transferred to Angolan [[Ilyushin Il-76]], which in turn flew them directly to the front.[10]
"And count us out if you do."[150] General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]], the senior Cuban military officer in Angola, also protested that the tactics FAPLA were being forced to adopt were more applicable to combat operations in central Europe than an offensive against an irregular fighting force on the broken African terrain.[121] [[Ronnie Kasrils]], MK's intelligence chief, warned the Soviet mission that if Saluting October proceeded an SADF counteroffensive was imminent.[9] Gusev overruled the Cuban and MK concerns, and the operation commenced without contingency plans for a South African intervention.[9]
The preliminary phase of the new offensive began in August 1987.[55][147] Eight FAPLA brigades deployed to Tumpo, a region to the east of Cuito Cuanavale in early August, where on Soviet advice they temporarily paused for more supplies and reinforcements.[9] This would prove to be a fatal error.[9] On 14 August, having lost days of precious time, FAPLA resumed its efforts to advance; by then South Africa had launched [[Operation Moduler]] to halt the offensive.[55] The bloody campaign that followed entailed a series of engagements known collectively as the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]].[124]
Prior to 1987, the South African government was reluctant to become directly involved with its UNITA's internal struggle with Luanda, other than providing that movement with arms and some limited air and artillery support.[note 1] Nevertheless, Botha recognised that if Jamba fell, the buffer provided by UNITA's presence in southern Angola would collapse with it, and FAPLA would allow PLAN to gain direct access to its territory contiguous to the border.[151] This would make PLAN infiltration of northern South West Africa almost impossible to check, especially in the Caprivi Strip and Kavangoland.[151] As Cuban and MK sources had predicted, the commitment of regular ground troops alongside UNITA was authorised, albeit on the condition that strict control would be exercised over combat operations at the highest level of government to ensure that political and diplomatic requirements meshed with the military ones.[151] The SADF took advantage of FAPLA's numerous delays to assemble a blocking force strong enough to stop the FAPLA drive on Mavinga.[19] By the end of August, South Africa's expeditionary forces near Mavinga had built up to include 32 Battalion, [[101 Battalion (South Africa)]] of the SWATF, and its elite [[61 Mechanised Battalion Group]].[114]
During Operation Moduler, Cuban combat troops had remained well north of the Lomba River and declined to participate in the fighting, per Castro's instructions.[70] In Luanda, President dos Santos summoned General Gusev and the senior Cuban general officer, Gustavo Fleitas Ramirez, for an urgent conference to discuss the worsening military situation and the failure of Operation Saluting October.[70] Ramirez reminded dos Santos that Cuba had been opposed to the offensive from the beginning.[70] Gusev lamented in his memoirs that "I informed [chief of the Soviet general staff] [[Sergey Akhromeyev]] about the result of the operation, but the most difficult task, in moral terms, was to inform the president of Angola, whom I had assured that the operation would succeed and that Savimbi would be crushed".[70]
On 25 November 1987, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 602]] was passed, condemning Operation Moduler as an illegal violation of Angolan sovereignty.[156] The resolution expressed dismay at the continued presence of SADF troops in Angola and called for their unconditional withdrawal.[156] South African foreign minister [[Pik Botha]] flatly dismissed the resolution out of hand, citing the unaddressed issue of Cuban linkage.[156] He promised that the SADF would depart Angola once FAPLA's Cuban and Soviet advisers had likewise been withdrawn, or when their presence no longer threatened South African interests.[156]
Per Botha's new directive, the SADF commenced [[Operation Hooper]] with the goal of encircling the retreating Angolan brigades and preparing for operations further east of the [[Cuito River]].[159] The decision to commence Hooper towards the end of the 1987 calendar year created problems for the SADF, since a number of white conscripts involved in the Lomba River engagements were nearing the end of their national service.[55] This led to a delay of several weeks while the existing troops were gradually withdrawn from Angola and replaced with a new intake.[55] The SADF had dispatched a second mechanised battalion, [[4 South African Infantry Battalion]], to Angola, as well as a squadron of [[Centurion (tank)]] tanks and a battery of [[G5 howitzer]] and [[G6 howitzer]] howitzers.[9] Between January and March 1988, the SADF and UNITA launched several bloody offensives just east of Cuito Cuanavale to destroy the shattered Angolan units that had succeeded in establishing a new defensive line there, an initiative which became known as [[Operation Packer]].[160] They managed to drive FAPLA deeper into a shrinking perimeter between the Cuito, Tumpo, and Dala rivers known as the "Tumpo Triangle".[9]
The SADF's declining [[Air supremacy]] forced a number of operational changes.[164] South African pilots exercised a standoff bombing capacity of twenty kilometres and timed their raids so they were out of range before FAPLA MiGs could be scrambled to intercept them.[164] The necessity of avoiding prolonged aerial contact was partly dictated by fuel considerations: the SADF Mirage F1AZ and F1CZ fighters launched from distant bases in South West Africa, which meant they had barely enough fuel for three minutes of combat once they reached Cuito Cuanavale.[162] The impact on ground operations was more consequential.[164] FAPLA MiGs flew reconnaissance missions in search of the G5 and G6 howitzers, forcing the South African artillery crews to resort to increasingly elaborate camouflage and take the precaution of carrying out their bombardments after dark.[19] Owing to the increase in losses and damage due to UNITA's US-supplied Stinger missiles, however, MiG pilots had to adopt contingencies of their own to reduce the vulnerability of their aircraft.[19] Cuban and Angolan warplanes were forced to drop bombs from higher altitudes, greatly reducing their accuracy.[19] FAPLA airfields were also monitored by South African forward artillery observers, who called in bombardments to destroy aircraft while they were exposed on the runway and preparing to take off.[165]
Although the SADF and UNITA counteroffensive had been checked, FAPLA remained heavily strained and more dependent than before on its Cuban allies and Soviet materiel.[141] This gave dos Santos an incentive to ease the military dilemma with negotiations and he reopened the possibility of reaching a new ceasefire and disengagement agreement with South Africa.[141] As early as January 1987, Chester Crocker had responded to positive signals from Luanda, especially when President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] of the People's Republic of the Congo offered to mediate peace talks between the rival states.[141] Yet preliminary discussions in [[Brazzaville]] throughout late 1987 and early 1988 remained stymied by the Angolan government's refusal to compromise on the timetable for a proposed Cuban withdrawal.[141] The Cuban government had not been consulted on the Brazzaville talks in advance and resented what it perceived as a discourtesy on the part of dos Santos.[141] This factor had the effect of persuading Castro to make an authoritative bid to join the Angolan-US peace talks.[129] He was determined that Cuba no longer be excluded from negotiations concerning its own military, and the results of any future settlement on the withdrawal process leave Cuba's image untarnished.[141]
While Operation Hooper was underway in late January 1988, Crocker relented to pressure and accepted Cuba as an equal partner in further peace talks.[14] Castro agreed that he would not introduce extraneous issues to the agenda, such as [[Cuba–United States relations]], and that discussion of a phased troop withdrawal would extend to all Cuban military personnel stationed in Angola, including combat troops, logistical staff, and advisers.[14] With Cuba's entry into the Brazzaville talks, its desire to shift its military involvement in Angola from a passive, defensive role to an offensive one intensified.[10] Castro opted to escalate ground operations against the SADF, since he considered diplomatic progress impossible as long as South Africa still clung to the likelihood of a tactical victory.[10] He retained a solely defensive posture at Cuito Cuanavale, keeping the SADF fixed in place, while carrying out his longstanding proposal to launch a flanking manoeuvre towards the South West African border.[159] The new offensive would consist of a movement of Cuban forces in divisional strength west of the Cunene River.[157]
The limited number of SADF troops available near the border could not halt the continued progress of the Cuban army or reduce the threat to South West Africa.[157] There were simply too few personnel and resources to secure the broad defensive positions along the Cutline against a conventional force in divisional strength.[157] Nevertheless, the SADF was able to slow the Cuban offensive with a series of effective delaying actions throughout mid-1988, an initiative known as [[Hilti]].[167] When South African officials warned against an invasion of South West Africa, Castro retorted that they were "in no position to demand anything".[10] Havana also issued an ambiguous statement which read, "we are not saying we will not go into Namibia".[10] The South African government responded by mobilising 140,000 reservists—a figure almost unprecedented in SADF history—and threatening severe repercussions on any Cuban unit which crossed the border.[100]
The failure of the Soviet-supervised Operation Saluting October, along with the consequent destruction of hundreds of millions of dollars' of FAPLA's Soviet-supplied arms, had the effect of moderating Moscow's stance on Angola.[129] In a notable departure from its previous foreign policy stance, the Soviet Union disclosed it too was weary of the Angolan and South West African conflicts and was prepared to assist in a peace process—even one conducted on the basis of Cuban linkage.[168] Reformist [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], also wished to reduce defence expenditures, including the enormous open-ended commitment of military aid to FAPLA, and was more open to a political settlement accordingly.[141]
According to Crocker, the US decision to use Security Council Resolution 435 as the basis and pivot for a regional settlement provided leverage over the discussions.[129] The proposed formation of a UN "verification mission" to monitor Cuba's adherence to a withdrawal settlement proved instrumental in persuading the South African government that it would receive a balanced agreement.[129] The talks began progressing more smoothly after July 1988, when Carlos Aldana Escalante was appointed head of the Cuban delegation.[169] Aldana was chief of ideological affairs and international relations for the [[Communist Party of Cuba]]; he was far better informed of foreign developments, particularly in the Soviet bloc, than many of his contemporaries.[169] In light of Gorbachev's reforms, political developments in Eastern Europe, and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers, Aldana believed that Cuba needed to work swiftly towards normalising relations with the US.[169] Cooperation vis-à-vis Southern Africa was seen as a natural prerequisite to better relations with Washington and possibly, a permanent bilateral dialogue.[169]
Between May and September 1988, the parties met for several rounds of talks in Cairo, New York, Geneva, and Brazzaville, but remained deadlocked on the nuances of the withdrawal timetable.[11] The fact that there were two objectives—Namibian independence and a Cuban withdrawal—doubly aggravated the issue of timing and deadlines.[129] In August, the Angolan, Cuban, and South African delegations signed the Geneva Protocol, which established the principles for a peace settlement in South West Africa and committed the SADF to a withdrawal from that territory.[170] As a direct result of the Geneva Protocol, PLAN declared a ceasefire effective from 10 August.[170] The [[1988 United States presidential election]] lent new urgency to the negotiations, which had recently stalled after six consecutive rounds of talks in Brazzaville.[11] Angola and Cuba had gambled heavily on a victory for [[Michael Dukakis]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)]] during the US elections, hoping that this would spell the end of US aid to UNITA and a harder line on South Africa.[140] At the time of the Geneva Protocol, dos Santos had commented that "if the Democrats had won the elections, there would be a readjustment in US policy, particularly on Southern Africa".[140] The election of Republican candidate [[George H.
Three days after the US election results were released, the parties reconvened in Geneva and within the week had agreed to a phased Cuban withdrawal over the course of twenty seven months.[129][140] In exchange, South Africa pledged to begin bestowing independence on South West Africa by 1 November 1989.[140] On 13 December 1988, South Africa, Angola, and Cuba signed the [[Brazzaville Protocol]], which affirmed their commitment to these conditions and set up a Joint Military Monitoring Commission (JMMC) to supervise the disengagement in Angola.[140] The JMMC was to include Soviet and US observers.[170] All hostilities between the belligerents, including PLAN, were to formally cease by 1 April 1989.[170] On 22 December 1988, the Brazzaville Protocol was enshrined in the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)]], which required the SADF to withdraw from Angola and reduce its troop levels in South West Africa to a token force of 1,500 within twelve weeks.[11] Simultaneously, all Cuban brigades would be withdrawn from the border to an area north of the [[15th parallel south]].[11] At least 3,000 Cuban military personnel would depart Angola by April 1989, with another 25,000 leaving within the next six months.[11] The remaining troops would depart at a date not later than 1 July 1991.[11] An additional condition was that South Africa would cease all support for UNITA, and Angola likewise for PLAN and MK.[140]
On 20 December 1988, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 626]] was passed, creating the [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission I]] (UNAVEM) to verify the redeployment northwards and subsequent withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola.[11] UNAVEM included observers from Western as well as non-aligned and communist nations.[11] In February 1989 the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the South West African peace process.[11]
On 31 March 1989, [[Pik Botha]] complained to the JMMC that PLAN troops had advanced south of the [[16th parallel south]] and were massing less than eight kilometres from the border.[170] He promptly intercepted [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] and UNTAG commander [[Dewan Prem Chand]] that evening and gave them the same information.[170] On the morning of 1 April, the first PLAN cadres crossed into Ovamboland, unhindered by UNTAG, which had failed to monitor their activity in Angola due to the delays in its deployment.[170] Ahtisaari immediately contacted SWAPO, ordering it to rein in PLAN, to little avail.[170] The South African foreign ministry also contacted the Secretary-General, who in turn relayed the same message to SWAPO officials in New York.[170]
At the end of the day, with no signs of the PLAN advance abating, Ahtisaari lifted all restrictions confining the SADF to its bases.[170] Local police mobilised and fought off the invaders in a delaying action until regular SADF forces were able to deploy with six battalions.[170] After the first two days the insurgents lost their offensive initiative, and the combined South African forces drove PLAN back across the border in a counteroffensive codenamed [[Operation Merlyn]].[170] Between 1 and 9 April 1989, 273 PLAN insurgents were killed in the fighting.[175] The SADF and police suffered 23 dead.[175] On 8 April 1989, the JMMC issued the Mount Etjo Declaration, which reiterated that the Tripartite Accord was still in effect and that South Africa, Angola, and Cuba remained committed to peace.[11] It also ordered all PLAN insurgents remaining in Ovamboland to surrender at UNTAG-supervised assembly points.[11]
[[Namibian parliamentary election, 1989]] under a [[Universal franchise]] were held in South West Africa between 7 and 11 November 1989, returning 57% of the popular vote for SWAPO.[178] This gave SWAPO 41 seats in the territory's [[Members of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia]], but not a two-thirds majority which would have enabled it to unilaterally draft a constitution without the other parties represented.[178] South West Africa formally obtained independence as the [[Republic of Namibia]] on 21 March 1990.[175]
