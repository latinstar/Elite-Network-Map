The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or MONUSCO (an [[Acronym]] based on its French name Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo), is a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].[2] A planned withdrawal from the country is currently on indefinite hold due to advances by the armed group M23 in the North and South Kivu provinces.[3][4]
MONUSCO was established by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1279]] (1999) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1291]] (2000) to monitor the peace process of the [[Second Congo War]], though much of its focus subsequently turned to the [[Ituri conflict]], the [[Kivu conflict]] and the [[Dongo conflict]].[5] The mission was known as the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo or MONUC, an acronym of its French name Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies en République démocratique du Congo, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1925]].
The following nations (in alphabetical order) have contributed with military personnel: [[Bangladesh]], [[Belgium]], [[Benin]], [[Bolivia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Ireland]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Jordan]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mali]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Senegal]], [[Serbia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Tanzania]], [[Tunisia]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Uruguay]], [[Yemen]] and [[Zambia]].
In addition, the following nations have contributed with police personnel: Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, [[Chad]], [[Djibouti]], Egypt, France, Ghana, [[Guinea]], Jordan, [[Madagascar]], Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Sweden, Switzerland, [[Togo]], Tunisia, [[Turkey]], Ukraine and Yemen.[2]
The initial UN presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, before the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1291, was a force of military observers to observe and report on the compliance on factions with the peace accords, a deployment authorised by the earlier [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1258]] (1999).[6] UNSCR 2556 (2020) provides the authority for the current MONUSCO mandate.[7][8]
The origin of this second United Nations military presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is found in the [[Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement]] on 17 July 1999 and the following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1258]] of 6 August 1999, authorizing the deployment of a maximum of 90 officers.
In November 1999 the number of liaison officers totaled 55, distributed in the capitals of the warring countries ([[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]], Zambia, [[Namibia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Ethiopia]]) including 24 who were stationed in [[Kinshasa]].
On 4 April 2000 the Senegalese Major General [[Mountaga Diallo]] was appointed as the commander of MONUSCO's military force.
Acting under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], the UN Security Council authorized MONUC to take the necessary action, in the areas of deployment of its infantry battalions, to protect UN personnel, facilities, installations and equipment, ensure the security and freedom of movement of its personnel, and to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.
The observers could only record the non-application of the Ceasefire, the violent fighting at [[Kisangani]] and in the [[Équateur (former province)]] and [[Katanga Province]] provinces as well as the presence of foreign troops in the DRC.
Even though the beginning of 2001 was still hampered by sporadic combat, the military observers could fulfill their mission in regards with the disengagement of forces and the withdrawal of some of the [[Rwanda Defence Force]] and [[Uganda People's Defence Force]].
In March 2001, the first [[Armed Forces of Uruguay]] guard unit arrived in [[Kalemie]].
The force was deployed in four sectors at [[Kananga]], [[Kisangani]], Kalemie and [[Mbandaka]].
Guard units protected MONUC installations in [[Kinshasa]], [[Kananga]], [[Kisangani]], Kalemie, [[Goma]], and Mbandaka.
A Uruguayan riverine unit and a [[South African National Defence Force]] air medical evacuation team were also deployed.
Following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1355]], the military observers, within their capacities, could also contribute to the voluntary disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration process of the armed groups.
With [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1376]], the Security Council launched the third phase of the deployment of MONUC troops, in the eastern DRC.
The site for the logistical base was planned to be [[Kindu]], [[Maniema Province]].
The riverine units escorted the first ships on the [[Congo River]], which was again open to commercial traffic.
On 14 May 2002, a military observer died near [[Ikela]] following the explosion of a mine under his vehicle.
On 30 July 2002, the different parties signed the [[Pretoria Accord]] and the nature of the mission of the peacekeepers changed.
The military observers monitored the withdrawal of 20,000 Rwandan soldiers, but they also noted the rise of [[Ituri conflict]].
Through [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1445]], the Security Council authorized the increase of military personnel to 8,500.
Over one hundred observers were redeployed and Uruguayan contingents arrived in [[Bukavu]], [[South Kivu]] and [[Lubero]], [[North Kivu]].
In April 2003, 800 Uruguayan soldiers were deployed in [[Bunia]], [[Ituri Province]] under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1484]].
The UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] called for establishing and deploying a temporary multi-national force to the area until the weakened MONUC mission could be reinforced.
On 30 May 2003, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1493]] authorized the deployment of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) in Bunia with a task to secure the airport and protect both [[Internally displaced person]] in camps and the civilians in the town.
UNSCR 1493 authorized an increase of military personnel to 10,800, imposed an arms embargo, and authorized MONUC to use all necessary means to fulfill its mandate in the [[Ituri District]] and also in North and South Kivu, as it deemed the additional provinces to be within MONUC's capabilities,
The [[Cabinet of France]] had already shown interest in leading the operation.
It soon broadened to a [[European Union]] (EU) -led mission with France as the framework nation providing the bulk of the personnel and complemented by contributions from both EU and non-EU nations.
The total force consisted of about 1,800 personnel and was supported by French aircraft based at airfields in [[N'Djamena]], Chad and [[Entebbe]], Uganda.
A small 80-man [[Särskilda Skyddsgruppen]] (SSG) group was also added.
The operation called [[Operation Artemis]] was launched on 12 June and the IMEF completed its deployment in the following three weeks.
In July 2003, [[India]] announced that it would be sending an additional 300 personnel and combat aircraft from the [[Indian Air Force]] to strengthen the UN peacekeeping effort in DRC.[12]
Deploying the Ituri brigade and conducting [[Cordon and search]] operations improved the security conditions in Ituri but, at the same time, the peacekeepers became the target of the militias.
With the arrival of the [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], which included members of rebel movements, more than 900 Tunisian and Ghanaian UN troops contributed to the security of Kinshasa.
In June 2004, Bukavu, South Kivu was occupied by rebel general [[Laurent Nkunda]].
Though the Secretary General had asked for an increase of 13,100 soldiers, in October 2004 the Security Council by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1565]], authorized a reinforcement of 5,900 military personnel and defined the mandate with the strategic military objectives of the MONUC force as:
Following the UN resolution, the [[Indian Army]] announced that it would be sending an additional 850 troops and four combat helicopters to aid the MONUC peacekeeping effort.[13]
[[Thomas Lubanga Dyilo]], the leader of the [[Union of Congolese Patriots]], and other militia leaders were arrested by Congolese authorities and imprisoned in [[Makala]], Kinshasa.
On 10 February 2006, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Lubanga for the [[War crime]] of "conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen years and using them to participate actively in hostilities." The Congolese national authorities transferred Lubanga to ICC custody on 17 March 2006.[16]
Senegalese General [[Babacar Gaye]] was appointed force commander in March 2005 after Spanish General Vincente Diaz de Villegas resigned for personal reasons.
In late January, a group of 80 Guatemalan Special Forces from the [[Kaibiles]] were engaged in a four hour firefight with LRA rebels, ending with the deaths of eight Guatemalans and fifteen rebels.
They are believed to have been conducting a raid on an LRA encampment to capture LRA Deputy Commander [[Vincent Otti]].
The incident caused a significant uproar from both the [[Government of Guatemala]] and the Guatemalan public, who demanded an official inquiry into the engagement.[18]
On 25 April 2006, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1671]], authorising the temporary deployment of a [[European Union]] force to support MONUC during the period encompassing [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006]] in the DR Congo, which began on 30 July 2006.
The European Council approved the launching of the EU military operation, [[EUFOR RD Congo]], and appointed Lieutenant General Karlheinz Viereck (Germany) Operation Commander and Major General Christian Damay (France) EU Force Commander.
The Operational Headquarters was the German-nominated Armed Forces Operational Command – Einsatzführungskommando – at [[Potsdam]], Germany.[19] The mission was tasked with:
In May 2007, [[India]] announced that it would be sending an additional 70 [[Indian Air Force]] personnel to join the MONOU effort.[21]
On 26 October 2008 [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD) forces of [[Laurent Nkunda]] seized a major military camp, along with [[Virunga National Park]] for use as a base to launch attacks.
This occurred after a peace treaty failed, with the resultant fighting displacing thousands.[23] The park was taken due to its strategic location on a main road leading to the city of [[Goma]].
On 27 October 2008 riots began around the United Nations compound in Goma, and civilians pelted the building with rocks and threw [[Molotov cocktail]], claiming that the UN forces had done nothing to prevent the RCD advance.[24] The [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] also retreated under pressure from the rebel army in a "major retreat".[24]
Meanwhile, United Nations [[Attack helicopter]] and [[Armoured fighting vehicle]] were used in an effort to halt the advance of the rebels, who claimed to be within 7 miles (11 km) of Goma.[25] Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRC [[Alan Doss]] explained the necessity of engaging the rebels, stating that "[the UN] can't allow population centres to be threatened ...
[[Indian Army]] personnel were asked to deploy themselves from Goma to adjoining [[North Kivu]] province, after the Uruguayan battalion deployed in the region fled.[27] However, after that several Uruguayan battalions were playing a crucial role in the buffer zone between the retreating government soldiers and the advancing rebels.[28]
In November 2008, India announced that it would be sending the 3rd battalion of the [[3rd Gorkha Rifles]] regiment to replace a [[Sikh Light Infantry]] battalion and join the peace-keeping effort in the Congo.[31] India made the decision to send its elite forces amidst rising concerns that Indian peace-keepers were getting caught in the cross-fire between DRC government troops and rebels.[31]
On 4 November 2008, a 200-fighter strong Mai Mai militia force launched a surprise attack on CNDP troops in Kiwanja, a CNDP-controlled town near [[Rutshuru]], North Kivu.
After the town was retaken, CNDP forces under the command of [[Bosco Ntaganda]] combed through Kiwanja, searching out boys and men – who they accused of collaborating with the Mai Mai – and executing them on the spot.
Brar, commander of the Indian peacekeepers at Kiwanja summarized the failure as the result of "poor communication and staffing, inadequate equipment, intelligence breakdowns and spectacularly bad luck."[33] In its report on the massacre, [[Human Rights Watch]] largely supported Brar's assessment but further observed that competing priorities from headquarters in Goma shifted focus to "assuring the security of humanitarian workers, a foreign journalist, and a group of military observers, rather than protecting the civilian population."[34]
In the immediate aftermath of the Kiwanja Massacre, the recently appointed civilian and military heads of the UN peacekeeping force in North Kivu, [[Hiroute Guebre Sellassie]] and Gen.
[[Bipin Rawat]], brought their commands together for evaluation.
On 18 November, a draft resolution spearheaded by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)]] was presented before the [[United Nations Security Council]].[35] The resolution, signed by 44 different organizations and with the backing of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] minister [[Mark Malloch Brown, Baron Malloch-Brown]], asked the UN to send 3,000 more peacekeepers to reinforce the 17,000-strong garrison in the Congo, the largest garrison of its kind.[36] This echoed calls from Human Rights Watch and other [[Humanitarian aid]] groups in the region, who were also asking for reinforcements to bring stability to the area.
Fighting has also invaded and torn apart the region of [[Rutshuru Territory]], particularly in the town of Kiwanja, where hundreds of civilian deaths have now been recorded."[37]
Local groups in the Congo also requested help from the [[European Union]], as they would be able to deploy soldiers sooner, working as a "bridging force" until the UN reinforcements arrived.
On 20 November, the UN voted unanimously to send 3,085 more peacekeepers, citing "extreme concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and in particular the targeted attacks against civilian population, sexual violence, recruitment of child soldiers and [[Summary execution]]." However, it did not extend MONUC's mandate in the Congo, which was set to expire at the end of 2008.[39] The decision was made despite the rebel commitment to pulling back from the front lines and allowing aid to reach the thousands of people still isolated, according to aid groups.[40]
On 17 February, [[Egypt]] announced that it would send around 1,325 soldiers from the Egyptian Army to support the UN mission in Congo.
In March 2009, the Indian Army questioned more than 100 Indian troops deployed in DRC regarding the abuse allegations against them.[43] After a thorough investigation, which included examination of statements by alleged victims, the Indian Army found "serious irregularities" in charges raised by the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services]].
In October 2009, India announced a US$263 million aid package to Congo to help the country's information technology, [[Hydroelectricity]] and railway sectors.[44] India also renewed its military commitments to MONUC while Congo expressed its support for [[Reform of the United Nations Security Council#India]].[44] These developments helped thaw relations between the two countries.
In December, MONUC rushed peacekeeping troops to [[Dongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the [[Kungu]] territory of [[Sud-Ubangi District]] where [[Dongo conflict]] rapidly escalated in an effort to protect the local population.[45] A MONUC helicopter that was restocking the 20 troops stationed there fell under gunfire from armed men.
The helicopter crew, all of Russian nationality, facilitated the evacuation of 25 people, including 5 injured people (including the helicopter pilot), who were brought to [[Brazzaville]] for emergency medical treatment.[46]
Sources in Kinshasa reported that in mid-November DRC President [[Joseph Kabila]] secretly airlifted a battalion of [[Rwandan Defense Forces]] (RDF) across Congo to put down the rebellion in Dongo and the operation was supported by the United Nations Observes Mission in Congo ([[MONUC]]) and the [[United States Africa Command]].
Along with RDF regulars, MONUC troops have been fighting alongside [[Tutsi]] Rwandan soldiers infiltrated by Rwanda, with the Kabila government's support, into the national army, the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC).[47]
In August 2010, the Mai Mai rebels ambushed a base of the 19th [[Kumaon Regiment]] of the [[Indian Army]], killing three Indian peace-keepers.[49] The attack renewed calls in India to decrease the country's military presence in Congo due to growing conflict in the region.
In June 2011, the UN announced that it would withdraw about 2,000 peace-keepers by the end of the month.[51] The UN announcement came only a few days after India's decision to withdraw all of its four [[Mi-35]] combat helicopters from MONUSCO and eventually cease peace-keeping operations in DRC.[52]
On 15 November, MONUSCO helicopter gunships were deployed to support government forces as they fought to hold off a [[March 23 Movement]] attack south of Kibumba; the combined army and UN assault killed approximately 64 M23 fighters.[53]
On 20 November 2012, 23 March Movement seized the provincial capital of [[Goma]] after the national army retreated.
MONUSCO troops observed without intervening, as their mandate only allowed them to protect civilians.[54] French Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] called the situation "absurd", noting MONUSCO's greatly superior numbers, and called for the group's mandate to be revised.[55] UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey said peacekeepers "cannot substitute" for the Congo national army, adding that the 1,500 UN troops in Goma held their fire because they did not want to risk civilian lives.[56]
In January 2013 chief of MONUSCO [[Herve Ladsous]] told the UN Security Council during a closed-door session that the mission plans to deploy three [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] in eastern provinces of DRC.
However, Rwanda, which had denied allegations by UN experts that it has been supporting the [[March 23 Movement]], opposed this proposal.
In March 2013, the United Nations [[Security Council]] authorized the deployment of an intervention brigade within MONUSCO to carry out targeted offensive operations, with or without the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], against armed groups that threaten peace in eastern DRC.
The brigade is based in [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo]], North Kivu, and is made up of a total of 3,069 peacekeepers.
It is tasked with neutralizing armed groups, reducing the threat posed to State authority and civilian security and to make space for stabilization activities.[58] The first Brigade was composed of three battalions, one each from [[South African Army]], [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] and [[Malawian Defence Force]] with the Brigade being commanded by [[James Aloizi Mwakibolwa]][59] of Tanzania.
After the [[2014 South Kivu attack]] in June 2014, the UN announced it would send MONUSCO peacekeeping troops to the area to protect the population.
In May 2015, [[Allied Democratic Forces]] Ugandan rebels ambushed a MONUSCO convoy about 7 miles (11 km) from Beni, killing two Tanzanian soldiers.
In October 2015, [[Maman Sambo Sidikou]] succeeded [[Martin Kobler]] as head of the MONUSCO.[67]
On 8 December 2017, the Semuliki operating base, 27 miles from the town of Beni, was [[2017 Semuliki attack]] which resulted in the deaths of 15 UN peacekeepers and 5 Congolese soldiers killed.
At least 12 of the dead UN peacekeepers were Tanzanians.[68][69] It is suspected that the attackers were rebels of the [[Allied Democratic Forces]] (ADF).[70] This brought the total casualties of UN forces since the mission commenced in Congo to 93.[71]
In March, due to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Ukraine withdrew its aviation unit of eight helicopters.[72]
[[Anti-MONUSCO protests]] emerged in late July amidst accusations by Congolese politicians and civilians of failing to take action to end the Kivu conflict within the country.
The protestors demanded that MONUSCO leave the country.[73] On 26 July, fifteen people were killed and 50 others were injured as UN peacekeepers opened fire at a protest in [[Goma]], North Kivu.[73] The same day, three peacekeepers and seven civilians were killed during an attack on a MONUSCO base by protesters in [[Butembo]].[73] On 27 July, four protesters at a MONUSCO base in [[Uvira]] were killed by electrocution after soldiers shot an electric cable which fell on them.
South Kivu governor [[Théo Ngwabidje Kasi]] called for investigations as to whether the cable was shot by Congolese security forces or MONUSCO peacekeepers.[74]
In August 2023, protesters clashed with soldiers in a protest in [[Goma]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], against MONUSCO forces for the failure to prevent the violence of militants against civilians.
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] called for MONUSCO to withdraw from the country amidst a rising perception that they were failing to protect civilians.[76] MONUSCO initially agreed to a full withdrawal by the end of the year, with the first phase of the withdrawal beginning in July, involving the closure of their main office in [[Bukavu]], [[South Kivu]].[77] In July, amidst [[M23 offensive (2022–present)]] by the [[March 23 Movement]] in [[North Kivu]],[78] the pullout was halted and indefinitely postponed.
[[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Democratic Republic of the Congo)]] [[Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner]] expressed a concern for the creation of a security vacuum, stating "we will take into account the developments that we see on the ground before making responsible decisions and starting this process when the most favourable conditions are met."[4]
In January 2025, M23 [[2025 Goma offensive]], and at least 13 soldiers from the [[South African National Defence Force]] and one from the [[National Army (Uruguay)]] were killed.[79][80]
In 2025, UN Special Rapporteur [[Paula Gaviria Betancur]] visited the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) when there were 7 million displaced people.
The headquarters of the mission are in [[Kinshasa]], DRC.
In 2005-6 the Eastern Division however was formed at [[Kisangani]] and took over brigades in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri, along with two or three of the Sector HQs.
On 1 October 2004, the UN [[United Nations Security Council]] decided to deploy 5,900 more soldiers to Congo, although UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] had asked for some 12,000.
On 25 February 2005, nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed by members of the [[Nationalist and Integrationist Front]] militia in [[Ituri Province]].
On 30 July 2006, MONUC forces were charged with keeping the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006]]—the first multiparty election in the DRC since 1960—peaceful and orderly.
As of 31 October 2007, the total strength of the UN force was 18,407 uniformed personnel, including 16,661 troops; 735 [[United Nations Military Observer]]; and 1,011 police; supported by 931 international civilian personnel, 2,062 local civilian staff, and 585 [[United Nations Volunteers]].
On 31 October 2007 MONUC had a total of 18,407 uniformed personnel, including 16,661 troops, 735 [[United Nations Military Observer]], 1,011 police, who were supported by 931 international civilian personnel, 2,062 local civilian staff and 585 [[United Nations Volunteers]].
As of June 2022, major troop contributors, in order of total number of military personnel are [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[South Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Morocco]] (nearly 10,000).
On 20 November 2008, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted unanimously to reinforce MONUC with 3,085 more peacekeepers to deal with trouble in the [[2008 Nord-Kivu conflict]].[39] They voted after 44 organizations, led by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)]], petitioned the council to send reinforcements to stabilize the region.[38]
International civilian employees and volunteers, and DRC [[Nationality]]: 2,636
In 2007 and 2008, in several news and TV reports, the BBC published own evidence about Pakistani MONUC peacekeepers in [[Mongbwalu]] had entered in a gold-for-guns trading relationship with [[Nationalist and Integrationist Front]] (FNI) militia leaders, eventually drawing Congolese army officers and Indian traders from [[Kenya]] into the deal.[96][97] Following its own investigations, the UN concluded that there was no involvement of Pakistani peacekeeper in any such trade relationship.
Brown was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa (1987–1989) under [[George Shultz]] and George H.
